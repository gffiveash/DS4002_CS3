Bad formula,Love the color but this thing broke within the first week and I didn‚Äôt even drop it. All I did was set it down on my table while I was blending and it broke on the spot. Very sad formula unfortunately and also hard to work with as it doesn‚Äôt blend out too good without very careful technique and carefulness,SalmaElnady,06 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,"Pros: very pigmented, love the color
Cons: so much fallout! Color goes on too strong even after tapping my brush. I looked like a clown and have to dab a lot off with a napkin.",carleebird,05 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
The best,I love using it very much. I have fair skin and it suits my face perfectly. I don't need to use highlighter.,,05 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,"I love this blush!!!! it‚Äôs so cut and works well on my skin, the product can break when you open it but i‚Äôve been really careful and it hasn‚Äôt broken yet!! it is kinda sparky though but i still love it so much!!",Abigail2025,04 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Intense Colour,This is the most intense blush I have ever used. One single tap of colour and then tapping/blowing excess off is more than enough. I was shocked at the colour intensity. It‚Äôll last forever at least lol. This colour wears pink with definitely peach tones on my pale skin.,Samwalita,03 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
It broke without dropping,"Had this product for maybe a a month and a half and it always stayed in my makeup bag until one day I tried using it as a mirror but it was broken :( it was unexpected for me because I couldn't figure out what could've caused it to break. Bought it in store

It was a great product, very pigmented and super pretty shade. Shiny finish. A little goes a long way",KJCB,03 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Much to fragile!,The actual product is lovely. The issue is how easily it breaks! I have had THREE of these blushes break; one in shipping and two during everyday use.  Sephora would not replace the two broken outside of the shipping process and suggested I contact Rare Beauty. Rare Beauty referred me back to Sephora.  I do not recommend this product due to how fragile it is.,Lorisnn,03 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
breaks so easily,nice color but breaks sooo easily! broke twice now. not worth the price and small amount too. dissapointed,summerlove1222,03 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Just not for me..,"This blush is very pigmented, which is not for me, but fortunately, if you love pigmentation, this is the product for you‚Ä¶ I must know that this plus is very delicate one time I bent over and half of the product broke and fell out of the pan, which is super disappointing, if you were to buy this product, just be very gentle but other than that, the formula is great and it‚Äôs not patchy whatsoever Ôøº",Leticiaa25,02 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Breaks very easily,Breaks soo easily! Too bad because it's such a pretty color and has good payoff but the way it's pressed into the compact is horrible and it breaks super easily! Will not be buying again!,SkinLovinNurse,02 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,Beautiful color but patchy and hard to blend. First product of rare beauty I didn‚Äôt like,tinafs,31 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Purchased from the store BROKEN.,"After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase from the store hoping to bypass any possibility from breakage if I had purchased from online.
When I opened it, I was disappointed to find it was already broken. I didn‚Äôt even get to use it once! What was worse was that bits of it fell everywhere, ruining my counter tops and sink.",joannafromsa,31 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Falls apart,"I love the color of this blush but it's so FRAGILE. It will crumble and fall apart immediately. I have it stored in my makeup bag that I leave at home in a drawer!

Pigment!!!,"Great product, so much pigment. My advice, get a shade lighter than you think you need, with this much pigment you don‚Äôt need a dark shade.",cassklass,22 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Not a repeat buy,"I loved the luminous colors of both joy and cheer, however, for me, the packaging was a fail. The lightweight round compact was very slippery compared to a square compact and I dropped the cheer before even being able to use it. It went into powdery pieces and I realized there really wasn't much product in the compact to begin with.
Three stars for the product that was there.",Kathleen619,21 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Cracked after one use,"I loved the sheerness & the fact I could skip a highlighter because this gave color & shine ‚Ä¶..

"Beautiful blush, far too fragile.","Absolutely LOVE this product, but like many others have said, it‚Äôs so so quick to break. I had this product for maybe 3 weeks and I set it down on my sink before I went to put it on, and upon opening it, I witnessed my almost $30 blush broken in small crumbs. I‚Äôve never had such a hard time with the packaging of a product before. I would buy this blush in every shape, size, color, etc if it just wasn‚Äôt so fragile. I really would recommend this blush but only if you‚Äôre willing to keep buying it every time it breaks (it keeps getting finer and finer until it‚Äôs unusable)",jadyndittrich,17 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

"Love it, but...","Absolutely love this blush, but it broke when i went traveling and this blush was the only thing in pieces.",Smthbeautiful2,15 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Beautiful blush. Terrible packaging,"This is by far my favorite blush I have ever used which makes it so hard to only give a one star. The blush itself is beautiful, the formulation with the blush and highlighter is really great. However, this is the worst packaging I have ever seen. I bought one blush and within the first month it was shattered. I thought maybe it was by my mistake. I bought a second blush in another color and within a week of it going from my counter to my makeup bag, it was shattered. After reading many reviews and talking to Sephora employees, this seems to be a very common occurrence with this blush. I can no longer wear it because it‚Äôs a mess whenever I open it, therefore I rate the blush a 1. It‚Äôs such a shame because I have loved everything from Rare Beauty, but I‚Äôm not wasting my money on products that fall apart at the slightest touch. If they fix the issue, I‚Äôll buy every shade.",beautyjunkie03,15 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Broke right away,I love the way this blush looks but i had it for a few weeks before it broke. I‚Äôve seen online that a lot of other poeple have also experienced this. Really disappointing for the price point.,madicig,14 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
"Flimsy container, don't waste your money.",I love the product but the container which it's in is very flimsy. My daughter bought the same one in Hope and dropped it and broke right away. Unusable. Mines dropped 3 months later after I purchased and broke as well. I have been using the dior one and have this for back up. It was like brand new. So dissapointed.,Mscandy11,14 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

My go to blush,"I absolutely love this blush , I bought it in store. I had been looking for a pink blush w/ a glow effect. I shopped around and other blushes were too shimmery or matted pink. I was hesitant to try Rare Beauty, I thought it would be like others, too shimmery but I love the shade I love how it makes my skin glow. I also get so many compliments on it. Some ladies even ask what blush and shade. My skin is oily and I‚Äôm medium tan skin complexion.",Sammitx,13 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
My favourite powder blush!,"I love this blush! The pigment is perfect, the colours are beautiful, and it lasts all day. Layers wonderfully with both liquid & cream blushes. As someone who needs powder products due to oily skin, it‚Äôs lovely to have a powder blush that doesn‚Äôt make my base so matte.",mylaaaaaaa,13 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
I love Happy!,"Happy is a beautiful pink! The blush has held up totally great unlike the highlighter, but I do worry about the consistency. This is shimmery without being too much. Looking forward to trying more",ErinBeee,12 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Great Product But Breaks Easily,This product works nicely and is pigmented. I‚Äôve been using it for two weeks now and I‚Äôve liked the results. The only problem I have is that the blush is very breakable. You have to be careful when you are traveling with this thing or it might shatter,abriiiiii,12 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Obsessed,"Love love love this blush! Very pigmented, and leaves a beautiful shiny glow to the cheeks. I've had so many people ask what I'm wearing for blush and many friends are wanting to get it too!",girlwiththecats,11 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Breaks during shipping,"I should‚Äôve read the reviews before purchase. Mine came completely ruined, powder everywhere and on all my other purchases. I think I would‚Äôve liked the color tho, I would just STRONGLY recommend purchasing at the store and not online",brittanacus,11 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Horrible packaging resulting in wasted product!,"Highly pigmented blush, but rating 1 star because the packaging is so poor it makes it almost unusable! I always have a really hard time opening this blush and the lid seems stuck, and after only having it for a few weeks I traveled with it in a makeup pouch one time and the entire thing was broken upon opening and made a huge mess! I wouldn't buy this again and will have to check out the liquid options instead, I think",trisht93,11 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,Really like the colour and sparkles! Very subtle but also nice. This shade is much more orange then how it looks on the website. Otherwise it‚Äôs a really cute coral colour!,catan2008,10 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Disappointing,"This product was a huge disappointment. It didn‚Äôt apply very well, and looked patchy and kind of chunky on my skin. Then one day I opened it to use and it was completely broken and unusable, and I have no idea how it even happened.",lowelch,10 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Beautiful but don‚Äôt travel with it anywhere!,"I am only giving this 3 stars because although the blush is gorgeous, the packaging is complete crap! It shatters at the slightest bump/tap.

,"This product is overall amazing, I love the pigment and the glow it gives but I just wish it was less fragile. It breaks very easily it‚Äôs like the highlighter but overall I love the formula.",,4 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
THE SHIMMER?! I DEF RECOMMEND üíóüíó,"I got this blush during the sale so maybe I'm a bit biased ü§≠ü§≠ but OH MY GOSH it is amazing. The glow this product gives me is goddess material, the colour is amazing, and the packaging is beautiful. If you want something similar to the highlighter but also want a pop of colour this is for you. I will say it was just a little bit hard to blend out and once it's on it's on for hours, so I wouldn't recommend this for everyday or for subtle looks, but if you want to pop and be that girl then this is 100% the way to go. Also try this on in store before you buy, the shade joy is not as orange as it seems. I was a bit scared of the colour at first but when a i tried it on irl it was amazing. I heard it's very fragile, I haven't had any problems though so idk.  I tried the cream blush too and if this much shimmer (it's really shimmery) is not your taste, I would look into the rare beauty cream blush!

Also, I know a lot of people say match the powder with your liquid blush, I don't necessarily agree. I have the colour hope in the liquid form and I got joy in the powder. They match amazingly.

Wont blend,it is so hard to blend and literally impossible to do with just a brush. i have to use my hand to blend it just a little bit its awful,rubygarrison,25 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Love this but breaks so easily,Okay I absolutely love this product it‚Äôs so beautiful and the shimmer on it is stunning. It‚Äôs my favourite blush but the only problem is the packaging. I‚Äôve bought two of these and both broke within a month despite being very gentle with them. I think they need to rethink the shape that the powder has been pressed into or just reinforce the outer packaging because it breaks so so easily,matteriane,23 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
"Fabulous blush, needs repackaging","Absolutely beautiful blush.  It IS true, however, that it breaks if you breath on it.  I think the packaging just needs a revision so that it's not dome-shaped in the pan.  Because the powder is so insanely fine (and fabulous) it just can't hold the dome without crumbling.",Mel1355,22 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Love this blush!,Beautiful glow and tons of pigment. Product is very true to color on the skin.,Llamafever,21 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Best. Blush. Ever.,"The most natural beautiful blush I have ever worn - not to mention budget friendly.  As a 67 y/o makeup aficionado, having spent thousands of dollars through the years chasing the perfect blush, this one IS IT!  Lovely, long wearing and buildable.  Does not irritate my rosacea or sensitive skin one little bit.   It feels like a treatment blush, is that possible?",GreenPasturesR,15 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Never leave home without THIS blush,I‚Äôve purchased this twice. I love it! Highly pigmented and lasts an entire work day. (Even the LONG Election Days-some days were 12-16 hours long!),KrissiK904,14 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
The worst experience,"I can say that this is the worst highlighter and blush I've ever had. Maybe it's suitable for someone, but definitely not for me. It just turns the face into a layer cake. I returned it",alphacybergirl,14 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Skip this purchase,Was not a huge fan of this product. I love Rare Beauty but this product did nothing for me. The color was beautiful but it did not last at All. It just sits in my makeup drawer untouched :(,22kam22,11 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

I immediately went to Sephora and they said they could not return it and that next time I should be more careful because  because of the type of formula because of the formula. Very disappointed,lilianahluna,5 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Never buy this online,Save yourself the hassle of having to go exchange  it in store and never buy it online. I wanted to do in store pick up but said that it was sold out even though it got restock a few hours after the sale ended.. Sephora refuses to use more paper to protect fragile items so it‚Äôs pointless to exchange by mail .,Katouchka,4 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Blushlighter beauty!,"I have used this in three different shades and hit pan twice. Yes, this is just as fragile as the rare beauty highlighters and some people do find it can accentuate a lot of texture but it used as a blush topper on the highest point of the cheek can look extremely glowy and beautiful.

,"The formula of this product is incredible, the bad thing is the case. And Sephora doesn't know how to package such a delicate product either.

Very pigmented. Nice packaging!,"Like most of Rare Beauty‚Äôs products it‚Äôs very pigmented. I‚Äôm still sort of a beginner so using this was hard for me. It would always go on stronger than I wanted and took me multiple tries to get it right. Combined with my dry skin taking it on and off was a hassle, but I can see how someone who is used to pigmented powder blushes wouldn‚Äôt care. Anyway long story short this is good and pigmented. Very shiny and shimmery, which is what I like, but good to know if you don‚Äôt.",Violetlovescats,25 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Not my cup of tea,This is just my personal preference but I didn‚Äôt like the goldfish flecks in a blush. Didn‚Äôt feel like a natural finish. The texture of the blush was bouncy and so that was a plus,sarasoorasy01,25 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Very pretty BUT could use some imrrovements,"This blush is absolutely gorgeous! I love the luminous glow it gives my cheeks, and the colour is pretty. However, I‚Äôve noticed quite a bit of fallout when picking it up with my brush, which feels like a lot of product is going to waste. Additionally, the container doesn‚Äôt seem to hold much product‚Äîafter just a month of use, it‚Äôs already halfway empty.",Scorpio1990,22 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Beautiful Color,"All the reviews about it being fragile kinda frightened me but I bought it anyways. FAFO, right? So far so good. The powder is soft and silky and goes on smoothly. More pigmented than I expected but I love it.",DanielleSheree,22 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Nice color and stays on,This is the second color of this blush I have purchased. It stays on all day and goes on well. Nice colors.,lambchop2,21 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Not worth it,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong very pretty, but I ordered the product 2 separate times and both broke under a week of me having them. Literally just broke and crumbled. Such a waste of money.",abbymarsimp,21 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Broke too soon,"The item broke so easily, only lasted about 2 months and now it‚Äôs too late to return.",NAYGAL,19 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
"NO Pinch of Peach on Fair Skin, Zero","The product did not leave a drop of color on my fair skin. For the next use I tried to layer it, still no luck. There was no ‚ÄúSoft Pinch‚Äù zero ‚Äúluminous‚Äù as stated in the advertisement. I sincerely tried to make it work, it did not even put a hint of the luminous pinch of peach over another blush as a tiny bit of highlight. Sadly I cannot recommend this and wished I had given up soon to get a refund, so disappointed.",mybelladreamer,18 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

So Pretty & Take Care of It,"This product is absolutely wonderful! I incorporate it into my daily makeup routine, and it truly enhances my look. Unfortunately, there was one incident where I accidentally dropped it into my sink, and it shattered into a million pieces, creating quite a mess.

Disappointed,I LOVE the color and texture but it was loose powder by the time it arrived. Nothing else in my order was damaged except this.,DebbieFL,17 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Too fragile!,I have ordered this product twice and it shattered both times.  The first time was with shipping and it was replaced. The second time it shattered when it was lightly bumped on a desk.  Sephora refuses to replace the item and suggested I report the issue to Rare Beauty.  This product is too fragile and I do not recommend.,Lorisnn,15 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Love these!,"These are great blush toppers! You can‚Äôt use them by themselves if you want though. I was scared to purchase online because of all the reviews saying theirs came broken but mine was fine. However, if you can help it I would purchase them in store, ( I don‚Äôt have a store close to me). Overall I love these and they look great despite me having skin texture. I would recommend. Also if you‚Äôre going to purchase them online I would suggest doing so when you have a largish order so there is less room in the box for them to crumble!",CassTunks,15 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Would return it if i could,"At first i really liked it, it was really pretty and sparkly but (idk it‚Äôs only an issue with mine) it began to look really cakey on my skin. It made my pores look huge and it‚Äôs very patchy. For the price, i‚Äôm very disappointed.",loryylove,15 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
SO BEAUTIFUL AND PIGMENTED,"I absolutely love this!! The shade is beautiful and so pigmented so you really don‚Äôt have to use much and the formula never breaks me out whereas other blushes have. The only qualm is that the powder can break easily if you‚Äôre not gentle of handling of your makeup, but I still use mine just fine!! And I had it for months before it broke up a bit",lialeon,14 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Fairly Awful,"Far from providing a soft,luminous glow, this blush sparkles with the light of a thousand disco balls.  I found it obnoxiously shimmery ‚Äî I have highlighters that are less so ‚Äî and the product itself is surprisingly fragile. Not only does the slightest touch of a brush produce excessive fallout, the entire pan shattered just from slight jostling in a vanity drawer.",IsobelJ,12 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Good Product!,This product actually broke the first time I purchased it but I ended up exchanging it for a new one which was in perfect condition.

Product Broke; Settled in Fine Lines,"I wasn't super impressed with the way this wore on my skin. This might be more suited to someone with younger skin or very little texture.

I can‚Äôt decide if I like it,It‚Äôs the glitter that is throwing me off. The shade and pigment are beautiful but it has glitter so I feel I use extra setting powder to try to tone down the glow.

Beautiful but it WILL shatter,"Gorgeous formula, shattered immediately.

The color is very bright, I like it a lot, although maybe I should have chosen a lighter color. A few weeks ago I dropped it on the floor and I was surprised that it was half as good as new. This idea was great.",Arifit,8 Aug 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

"Dare I say it, it's better than Hourglass!","I went into Sephora for a brow gel but was somehow drawn to the Rare Beauty blushes. I'd never tried them before, but they swatched beautifully. I initially got ""Hope,"" but it was too deep on my face, so I exchanged it for ""Cheer,"" which turned out perfect. I absolutely love the colour and the formula is INCREDIBLE! It gives you a natural, glowing-from-within look without any glitter settling into your pores. Let's be real, everyone has pores, and it's time to accept that nobody walks around with a Paris filter on their face. While you'll see your pores with this product, it's much less noticeable compared to other brands. This blush wears more beautifully than Hourglass, yes, I said it! It gives that perfect bright, wet, glow-from-within look with just a touch of brightness.

I plan to pick up a couple more shades because I've never received so many compliments on my skin!",MsNP,6 Aug 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Nice but fragile,"This is a perfect color and applies beautifully. BUT! Be so careful with it as it shatters into powder with little to no provocation.

However, on a recent vacation where we drove to our destination (did not fly) and my makeup bag was completely in my control, the blush shattered.

"Shatters and breaks, not worth it","I used this for a week after I noticed how great it looked on a friend at our neighborhood pool.  unfortunately, after being in my makeup bag, I took it out and it slipped in my hand barely touching the counter and shattered. The inside of the blush seems to be hollow, so it easily cracked and fell apart leaving a huge mess.  Great color but not worth the money IMO.  Doesn't last near as long as Benefit's blush, my go-to.",987huyt5r,2 Aug 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Needs to come with sensitivity warning.,I loved this blush. It was my favorite for several months. Took it on vacation and it fell apart. Wish I had seen these comments before vacation. I would not have taken it. I would probably buy it again but not take it on vacation or put it in a make up bag. Wish it had come with a warning. I see I am not alone. It's sad and broken like my cheer heart. LOL,RenaeW95,26 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Meh,I‚Äôm really not sure how I feel about this product. It‚Äôs really pretty but on my cheeks it emphasizes my pores and kind of sits on top of my skin. I‚Äôll keep using it to see if it will grow on me.,monienonie,26 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
My Go-To,Love this product!!!! It looks SO good! But I it is extremely breakable!!,raynapate,26 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Looks like makeup! Not an everyday blush for me,"This blush has its time and place! It looks amazing in pictures. It works perfectly with a full beat. But on natural makeup days it‚Äôs NOT it. I thought it might look like naturally dewy skin. It doesn‚Äôt. Instead It looks like I‚Äôve put highlighter and blush on. Which is fine! There are other skin-like products out there. This is a classic makeup-like product that I will only be reaching for on full-face days.

Also I‚Äôm a pale, cool toned girl so I chose the shade Happy, but it still pulls a bit warmer than I‚Äôd like on me. Blush came in tact and I haven‚Äôt had any breakage issues so far!",torimori,26 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Nice blush but damages so easily,"This blush is pretty, but breaks so easily. Accidentally dropped it once on my carpet and it cracked.

Not worth your dollar!!,"This blush, despite looking cute at first, quickly proved to be very difficult to work with. It emphasizes texture, and it‚Äôs almost TOO luminous. Unless you have perfect skin, this won‚Äôt look good on you. On top of this, this is also hands down the easiest blush to break on the market. Blinking too much around it will cause is to break.

Breaks very easy,I was really excited about this getting this product by seeing how it looks on others and being influenced by tiktok to get it. unfortunately I've had ordered two of these and both of them have broken. One was broken upon receipt thankfully I could return it and was able to get a new one and I have not had the new one for that long and just traveled with it for the first time and it broke as well. I have never had a blush product that has cracked and broke like this. while I do like the product this is very disappointing that I will have to waste another one and will not be able to use it. This product is very poorly made. I even packed it in my carryon and was pretty gentle with it and it still cracked and broke like this.,michflan,16 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

I don‚Äôt have a lot of texture in my face but this blush emphasizes me my pores A LOT, like A LOT. It didn‚Äôt sit too well on top of my makeup. It‚Äôs sheer but buildable. I bought the shade happy and Joy and I wanted happy to be more of a pale cool pink but I felt like it had purple undertones (if that makes sense). Shade is more on the orangey peachy side.

It‚Äôs a gorgeous product; it‚Äôs just extremely fragile.",sassandraaa,29 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Love it so much,I LOVE this product so silky smooth and such a pretty Color. 1 Pet peeve is when you use a brush it still goes on fine but the blush itself looks less and less smooth. Second photo is what I mean,Avaslayz,29 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Sparkly,"This stuff is so good! I like how buildable the pigment is, it‚Äôs not too much or too little. It blends super nicely, but I will say it is more like a highlighter than a blush, but not as luminous as the liquid illuminizer. It‚Äôs ever so slightly metallic but makes you sparkle! The color is slightly off from the photos, and the glitter in the blush sparkles as the shade the blush looks to be in the photos. I got Joy, and it looks pinker than it does in the image, but the sparkle is orange!",gothbarbiekae,28 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

"Soo pretty, but def not for no makeup makeup looks","Not sure why so many people dislike this blush! Its so pretty, has such a nice flush and is a beautiful highlighter too. It is very light, so def more of a blush topper than a singular blush (unless you like a lot of highlighter like me) but it looks a lot lighter in colour in person",MeiLuvMakeup,27 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

"A stand alone blush, good unique in all aspects","It‚Äôs a highlighter/blush that‚Äôs never been done before! A+ for creativity, technology, inspiration and colors. C for formula bc even though it is bc of how delicate the formula is that allows it to give such a soft yet impactful glow, it also cannot withstand any pressure or handling, it shatters if you throw it on something as soft as your bed a couple of times. Drop or through doesn‚Äôt matter, it will shatter. I can‚Äôt imagine how makeup artists feel about the breakables of this product,",emslee,12 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Breaks apart,Love love the color but it broke apart on me in the make up I keep at home. I am very careful with my products too. It pretty much exploded when I last opened it. only buy if they reformulate.,Jeandevivre,12 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
"Love The Product, Hate The Packaging","I love these blushes - they are truly radiant and gorgeous. Just like the powder highlighters, these shatter and break very easily, resulting in an awful mess and waste of product. It baffles me why such an innovative beauty brand outputs such intensely fragile products.",Jules618W,11 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
"Beautiful and long lasting, multidimensional color","I love this blush. I bought the Love color and it is beautiful with a wonderful flash of pinky coral and brown sort of. It is a multidimensional color and that is what I was looking for, I hate matte and flat blush colors. It also lasted ALL day.",cutiepatootie01,11 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Perfect amount of shine and color.,I love this 2 in 1 blush and highlight. Most blushes blend right into my face but this one doesn‚Äôt and with its pigmentation I don‚Äôt need much at all. I love this product so much I want to go back and get it in every color.,2elle5,10 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,I personally did not like it. Its not buildable and the color just seems off,,10 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,The product is gold the amount of product it brings and the fact the product is so fragile is a nightmare. My boyfriend broke my first one like 5 days into me having it and also has had me on edge considering me and my boyfriend sleep at each others houses often so we have to do a bit of travelling and even if it‚Äôs a 5 minute drive just don‚Äôt do it.,Katemciintosh,10 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Beautiful blush/highlight,"I love this blush/highlighter!  I can use it on its own for a beautiful soft glow, or over a matte blush for a beautiful highlight.  I am 52, and this does not emphasize texture in my skin, actually diffuses it a bit.",lulugrl727,7 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

beautiful,"in my opinion it is more pigmented that the soft pinch liquid blush, all you need is a tiny swipe. otherwise its amazing",Gioialuvsu,5 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Very  fragile,"Beautiful color but will show texture. The top is coated in the sheen so it wipes off in a couple of uses. Also this broke in about 2 weeks of having it. Same as all the others, I didn‚Äôt drop it and it broke in to a million pieces.",FlyJay,5 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Not what I expected,"The formula is very pigmented, but it's just not worth the money. It doesnt really glow. If you go up close, theres glitter on the skin and looks messy instead of leaving a nice healthy sheen. I still like it as a regular blush though. It is very pigmented, so I can't really use it as anything BUT a blush. I hoped it would be a soft highlight. 
I bought Hince True Dimension Glow Cheek which is the healthy, subtle, but ethereal glow blush I was looking for.",fi11789,5 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,"Great product! Definitely worth the money, very pigmented and a little goes a long way!!",cariiaa2,4 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
"Beautiful & Glowy, But More of a Topper","I thought this was the most gorgeous blush when I saw this in store and swatched it. Super glowy and unique. It is very pretty on the face and you definitely do not need highlighter while wearing this. I just do find the colour a little sheer and the glow kind of outweighs the blush if that makes sense. The colour also doesn't last all day but the glow does. 

I did end up purchasing a mini liquid blush in Happy and I used this as a topper. Both products combined are the perfect amount of colour and the glow is GIVING. So I wouldn't purchase this unless you apply this over more pigmented blush or you are looking for a more sheer finish.",conspiracisiri,4 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
"Beautiful, but falls apart","I‚Äôm a huge rare beauty fan, but after only two uses the powder completely fell apart and got all over my makeup, drawers and clothes. I bought it a few weeks ago and feel this should not happen so quickly!",Sbt0916,4 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
OKAY Save your money and get the liquid blush,After using this blush I was shocked. I love my rare beauty liquid blush but this is something else. The shade is very pretty when you put it on but as the day goes on the color fades and all you get is a harshline of highlighter,EKatezs,4 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
from blush to dust,"Loved the color and feel, but it literally exploded in my makeup bag without me ever dropping it. I was super bummed about that and planned on getting a replacement until the salesperson said that this was a common return. I'm surprised this has such a high rating given the very huge design/user flaw in the packaging. The product is very nice and loved the shimmer so was bummed that this is a common packaging issue. I'd purchase it again if they change the packaging to be more durable. I didn't take a picture, but it looked like what other reviews have shown.",trayseent,3 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Shatter city + not for dry skin,"It‚Äôs the same formula as the powders highlighters‚Äîso it was shattered before I could use it even once. It‚Äôs also a metallic formula, so instead of looking ‚Äúdewy and wet‚Äù, your skin texture is enhanced and sparkly. Compared to other blurring blush formulas that are also dewy (like Danessa), this one just doesn‚Äôt compare to the rest.",alizzychan,3 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
I would buy again,"I love this product. It is so pigmented, and very glowy. I basically love any rare beauty product. it blends very nicely. I have shade hope which is a nich shade but I think when I finish this one I think I'll  get a different shade.",,2 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Didn't Look Good on My Skin,"I thought this would give me a nice little shimmer, but instead it looked like I had put peach metal on my cheeks. I love that Rare Beauty products have great pigmentation, but maybe it's not such a good thing in a blush. Returned.",BrianaMcD,31 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,Rare Beauty Blush is a fantastic option for those who prefer a powder blush with a soft application and a natural finish. Its creamy formula makes it especially suitable for dry skin and offers a natural blush appearance that is perfect for daily use.,virginia3108,31 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
The colour is very disappointing.,The colour Hope is described as ‚Äònude mauve‚Äô but the blush I received is orange.  There‚Äôs nothing mauve/pink about it.  Not sure if it was mislabeled.  The radiance is pretty.,Niceandtall,30 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

glad I gave it a try,"I really like this product. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing and do not have any other Rare Beauty products. I purchased Joy, which is a subtle peach-- also a little different for me. It is not too shimmery and fine for day/work- the picture makes it look more shimmery/pearly than it is-- or maybe using it more heavily will achieve that effect but I was little nervous it was not going to be something I'd wear more casually at work ands its a new daytime favorite . I have used Nars blushes/bronzers forever and am glad I gave this a try.",rachel109,27 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,"Patchy. I use the liquid blush in Hope and have no issue, but the luminous one made me break out in hives exactly where I placed my blush. Pigment is not the same, and the luminous finish is not a natural glow, it‚Äôs chalky like cheap highlighter.",alisonbh,26 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Disappointing,"I was really disappointed with this blush. I love the soft pinch liquid and was looking forward to a powder version for times I didn‚Äôt want to take too much time to blend, but somehow this seems even more difficult to work with. It ruined my base makeup 3 times before I eventually gave up on it. It is just too splotchy and there is no way to get it to apply evenly. If you try to work it in it just gets too pigmented and ends up looking like clownish. I even tried applying to the back of my hand first and tried using a couple different brushes, with no luck. I love the concept but with the difficulty of use and the way it highlights texture this was a big waste of money for me. I‚Äôm really confused by all the positive reviews when it really missed the mark for me.",daniellegr,25 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,"Incredibly luminous, no chunky glitters or shimmers, just a beautiful glow. I use it as a blush topper and forgo using highlighter - I never need it when I use this. Taking off one star as the powder is so finely milled and delicate, you‚Äôll hit pan quickly and need to be very careful as it shatters easily.",mpdelr,21 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Beautiful color,I bought this specifically to use this as a quick eyeshadow. Goes perfectly with green eyes. Beautiful color and texture.,deevee11,21 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Lovely glow - a new must-have,"I was skeptical about this product because i was worried it would look glittery rather than an overall shimmer, but i am so happy i got this. It gives a beautiful glow and you can use this on its own or with liquid blush underneath.

"It‚Äôs nice, but I would not buy again","This isn‚Äôt anything worth the price. It‚Äôs nice and I still use it, but I wouldn‚Äôt purchase again. At first I found it difficult to blend out, but I use a light hand and fluffy powder brush and it looks best that way. I wish the peach was more pigmented and less gold shimmer, but that is just my preference. I didn‚Äôt expect as much gold when I bought it. Overall, if you want a powder blush, I think there are better alternatives out there for cheaper. I think a tinted highlighter is a better description for this product.",alexg7474788,18 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

If you have clear skin (definitely use it as a blush), bring it down your cheeks with a light hand! Don‚Äôt be afraid of the swatches, you need a fluffy brush like Pat McGrath. I was gifted this by my sister & it‚Äôs beautiful. Her professional advice (my sis-a MUA) is to matte your face & give the blush something to stick to.",LoreLaMe,16 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Gorgeous Summery Flush!,"This is so beautiful! It's beautiful, rosy and so luminous! The powder also feels very fine, lightweight and velvety, doesn't accentuate texture much.

High Shine!,"I personally love this product, but I will say I have pretty texture free/clear skin. It is very shimmery and on the border line of being glittery. If you have texture or don‚Äôt like a heavy sparkle this is not going to be for you since it gives a highlighter effect. I think sometimes people forget highlighter brings attention to an area so if you have acne/texture it is just going to emphasize it.",KennaPaige,14 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Eh RMS is better,"I was excited to try these, as I love the highlighter, but the color payoff just isn't there. Maybe I'll try another shade but honestly RMS is still my go to glowy blush because they are PIGMENTED. These are more like blush toppers.",MsWalter,14 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Not for fine lines.,"This is def a highlighter. Less of a blush. And while it‚Äôs very pretty, I gave mine to my daughter.  It works great for her. Shes 19. I am not a fan of the highlighter portion. It gets in my fine lines and enhances them.",sarah482,13 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

My go to blush for the rest of my days,The best blush I have ever used in my entire life! I have gotten my mother and grandmother to purchase it and they love it just as much as I do!

"Not glittery, just glowy!","I was hesitant because I'm not a fan of most of the Rare blush products, but this is really pretty.  I layer it over a matte color and it adds a beautiful glow and importantly it's not glittery.  It's glowy enough to skip highlighter but not so shiny it looks like you mistakenly applied highlighter as blush. I'm cool toned so it's nice to have an actual cool toned color that isn't ""clown pink.""  So far mine is not broken but I can see it's pretty fragile.",kittleherder,11 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Disappointing,"I was hoping these would just be a shimmery blush, however I feel like these are more of a pigmented highlighter. It‚Äôs as if there isn‚Äôt enough of a base color, and all of the color/pigment is in the shimmer particles. I do love majority of the products Rare releases, however these emphasized texture and missed the mark for me. I also purchased these with my own money for what it‚Äôs worth!",cethom,10 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

I should have known,This is gorgeous but it doesn‚Äôt work for me. Unless you have clear perfect porcelain skin it won‚Äôt work for you. It highlights any texture. It is beautiful and I can make it work as a blush topper but definitely can‚Äôt use it for its purpose. It is beautiful but it‚Äôs just not for me.,SyreetaM,9 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Beautiful!,"When this blush was suggested to me, I thought I'm 65, this is going to be too luminous for me. It is more glowy than the cream blush I'm used to wearing, but it looks beautiful!

"Beautiful and glowy, but fragile.","It was beautiful on my cheeks, I'm very oily so I needed to retouch it from time to time but if you want a natural look that may not be necessary. I usually wear it to show up on camera so I add a decent amount. The main downside is, like the highlighter, they're very fragile and prone to breaking. It's so sad because I love it so much. It's very glowy on the cheeks which I love. To get the most pigment I would use a brush intended for creams, which may be how it broke so fast. But they feel more like creams than powders to me, though they are technically powders, there are silicones and other creamy ingredients inside. Overall, I'd buy again but be very careful",ayokana,8 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Use very little,"Really pretty lots of pay off on this one, less is more.",Cynthia0202,7 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,This blush has a really nice color that lasts all day on my skin. The only downside is that it can make oily skin look a little greasy and accentuate texture. I‚Äôve found that a good pore-smoothing primer can take care of 90% of the texture though!,kstar2,1 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

I do not get the hype at all - blotchy and costume,"Am I using it wrong? Is everyone else lying? 

IDK, this just goes on super blotchy on my skin and looks ridiculous (I have clear skin and have not had this issue with any other foundation, contour, conealer, blush, or highlight).  

The pigment is lowkey embarrassing no matter how light handed I am and whenever I try to ""blend it away"", as the instructions say, it seems to get worse. I've tried to use it for like a month and it just isn't hitting for me. I kept trying to find videos of people applying it and it looking good, but weirdly no one is posting any (conspiracy....)

I literally look like I'm in a Broadway production with so much makeup people in the nosebleeds can see me, or like a little kid that got into her mom's makeup. I'm going to return it.",reenierosie,1 May 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

I tried three different blush brushes and then determined I should use my fingers to apply. The application does appear more glowy when applied with fingers. it is buildable and somewhat easily bendable. I do like the color. However, I was determined not to drop it and I did--lol and it broke immediately so I wish it was not so fragile.",Luluknowsbest,30 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,"I love the formula of this blush, however I have to give it a one star because of how frustrating the product & packaging has been for me. I‚Äôve purchased this blush twice & the first time it broke almost immediately after I bought it, & the second time it arrived broken & covered in product. I bought another shade in that same oackahe that ALSO arrived broken. It was a huge Sephora order from the Sephora sale & none of the other products from other brands were damaged or broken.

Exactly what I was hoping for <3,"I'm VERY happy I chose this, It's exactly what I've been looking for in a ""blush-highlighter"" hybrid, I'm finally satisfied. Although I like the Haus Labs ""Fire Opal"" one, but due to how fair I am, the red undertone started to look a little bit ""much"" after a while, which was sad to me, it makes a great eyeshadow just not a blush-light for my face. But the shade ""Joy"" by Rare Beauty gives me that true orange peek-a-boo pop I was wanting with a pinch of disco shine. Here in the picture collage you can tell and clearly see the difference. This is great because this cuts my budget in half, saving me money as I will be purchasing this from now on over fire opal.",sesswave96,28 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,"IN LOVE with this product. I love all of my Rare Beauty products, but this blush is something else!!",lilyacuna,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Expensive feel for an affordable price!,This product is so stunning on the skin! It gives the feel of an expensive formula but very affordable! A little bit goes a long way! If you don‚Äôt want an intense shimmer I‚Äôd recommend using a loose brush to apply! I‚Äôm using the shade ‚Äúhappy‚Äù on my model! Feel free to check out my IG for more tips! @thekingkasie :),TheKingKasie,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
MUST HAVE BLUSH,I love this product !! It‚Äôs so light and airy but still very pigmented. It‚Äôs also such a natural shine,Sasn,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,"Let me start off by saying, I LOVE THIS BLUSH. it is perfect for evey occasion and I love putting it on after my routine. I love how there is many shades so it all matches perfectly!!",gogetter12,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
This is an EVERYDAY staple to my routine!,"I live laugh love this product it was so long lasting, easy to apply, and surprisingly non expensive. This product lasted all day as well as all night! I very much recommend this product !",SophoraAddict,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Perfect to set the liquid blush or just by itself,Really pigmented just like the liquid blushes which I love. It has the prettiest shimmer to it that you don't get with the liquid blushes.,Ashkenken,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Weightless blush,This powder blush is really nice! I received it in the color Joy and it‚Äôs a muted peach. It lasts all day and can be buildable. It blends smoothly and is weightless. I use a brush to apply and the packaging is cute.,Sam051099,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,"I receive a broken products , love the color but sadly I receive a broken one",liliameloisse07,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
I use it whenever I put on makeup.,Application is super easy! It is pigmented and you barely have to use any product! It will last me a long time and is definitely worth the money!,AAAlyse,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,The best highlighter/blush combo you can find. I love a highlighted cheek moment and this has changed the game. It does break really easily though and it broke in the package when it got here.,alyssank,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
My new go-to blush,"This looks absolutely ethereal in sunlight and under artificial lighting. It's basically an expensive blush and highlighter combined into one. It's shimmery but not glittery and the level of pigmentation from Happy is perfect for me as someone with cool pale skin. A single dab or two with my brush is all I need to add a nice pop of pink and highlight to my cheeks and nose. I only wore MISSHA Glow Skin Balm under this blush and it lasted all day for me, and I had no problems blending it. One caveat, though, that I saw and heard from video reviews is that it can highlight texture. I think this may be because of the shimmer. I didn't have that problem myself, but it's something to keep in mind when purchasing. Other than that, I highly recommend giving this product a try, because I've definitely fallen in love with this!",vexicon,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,I have slightly textured skin but I actually love this!! I put this over my blush and it‚Äôs absolutely perfect.  Not super pigmented if you‚Äôre looking for that but I love the effect it gives when added on top of blush.  Beautiful product!!,HeathMar317,26 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,I bought every single shade and they are way too delicate for the price.  Three of them have broken.  The entire top just fell off of one of them.  Terrible quality.,ACarpentiere,25 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
A must have!,This Soft Pinch Luminous Poder Blush is everything a girlie girlie needs! it‚Äôs so pretty but watch out! Remember Luminous powder can make your skin texture be so visible if you go heavy on it! So be soft :),Zaileah,25 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Super easy to apply!,"I immediately fell in love with the soft texture of this blush. I love that it holds a lot of pigment that lasts all day, but has a beautiful light catching shine to it. I love that it‚Äôs like a highlighter, but without all the big chunks of glitter. This went on so well even over my textured skin. This works amazing as a eyeshadow topper as well! I love the shade joy for a copper peach wash of color to the cheeks! The baked formula makes it super easy to apply and very beginner friendly!",lizzygreenbean,25 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Too Delicate,So sad. It was broken on arrival. Won‚Äôt chance it and buy another. Too delicate.,chicaltna,25 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
More Highlighter than Blush,"This is like a highlighter and blush in one product. While the color payout and wear is great, it's way too glowy to use as a full blush for a daytime look. It's almost straight up reflective! The 'luminous' ingredient appears golden on my skin, and I really was looking for a true, cool-toned blush.",moxymiss,25 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Over hyped,There is little color payoff in the blush. It is more of a highlighter than a blush and also doesn't last very long. Lots of hype from influencers but not worth it. I tossed it in the trash.,Leecal,25 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Very cheap packaging üëéüèª,"Although the product is nice, the packaging is very cheap. As soon as I bought it, I accidentally dropped it by only 2 inches and the entire blush completely shattered. Drugstore quality at high end price üëéüèª",rubyjulez,25 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Useless,"Adding to all the reviews of how easily it breaks. I had this for three days. I noticed how powdery it was when I first got it. It took the lightest fall and is completely shattered, the product fell right out.",Megwolfe,25 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Great liquid blush topper,I use this as a topper over my rare beauty liquid pinch blush in Happy and find it lasts all day. I can‚Äôt wait to see what new products Rare Beauty Launches.,Islandgrl86,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Defective packaging makes product unusable,"I was really excited to try this blush, but when it came in the mail it was completely shattered. I see that this same issue has happened to many other people. Something about the packaging is clearly defective. I hope they resolve this issue and address it properly. The color looks beautiful but sadly I can‚Äôt try it out.",morganevelyn,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
So pretty,"I swatched it in store, and it was so pretty that I had to buy it. I loved how it went on smoothly and gave a nice glow.",123AJC,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Brocken,The package and product came like this which affected some of the items that I ordered inside the box. Sephora did not replace the items that‚Äôs got damaged by the broken blush besides this one and the new one came broken as well.,asianme,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Subtle and amazing,"Surprisingly good. I like cheek colors that look subtle, and this is amazing. When I try to swatch it on the back of my hand, it appears to be pretty warm, which made me concerned because I do not like cheek colors that turn orange on me. But it does not look orangey on my cheeks, which is a huge plus. I imagine this color would be hard to film a video review because it is subtle. But it looks so natural and flattering in real life.",23Lexy23,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
A game-changer!,"Obsessed! The pigmentation, creamy texture, and natural finish make it a must-have. It blends seamlessly into my skin for a flawless look!",Ramatahat,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Must have blush-holy grail status,Absolutely love these blushes! I bought 3 for me and one for my daughter. These go on sheer but can be build up. I have oily skin and wear a mask for my time of job and after a 7 hr shift the blush is still holding up! I,kimmimontreal,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
I don't get the point of this...,"I wasn't going to buy this, I swatched it in store and it felt dry/dusty. I kept seeing people I follow, and trust review it who liked it, so I decided to try to see if I was missing out. Spoiler I was not lol. If this is going to be a blush, then it should be a blush. This is dry on the cheeks and patchy. I prefer a smooth and plumping effect on my cheeks; maybe if this was a cream to powder formula, I would have liked it. I did think the concept could be pretty, innovative, and the look in photos/video is nice. I had to be realistic though, is this pretty in everyday real life or just metallic dust on the cheeks. It was giving the latter in person. I knew I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this in person or in a work setting so I returned.",Zoebear92,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Broken product,I am soo disappointed. Beautiful color but came in completely shattered,Anarbulgan,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Broken,The color was pretty but it broke so fast just setting it down on my desk. Not sure how I‚Äôm supposed to use it now.,ROMANBELL,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Such a pretty glow,This is so beautiful. On swatch it looks glittery but that doesn‚Äôt translate on the face. It‚Äôs just a pretty glow. I loved it so much I went back and picked up the peachy color as well. I also really like to use these lightly over liquid blush as a topper.,shansbury,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Twilight,"I wanted to love this product but it looked like I was Edward in Twilight when the sun hit my face. If you like that look, then this is the product for you!",lrw284,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Must have but CHANGE PACKAGING PLEASE!!!,Yall.. the two stars is not for the blush itself. It‚Äôs BEAUTIFUL! It‚Äôs for the packaging! This WILL shatter on you. Before buying remember you can‚Äôt travel with it. Any slight bump or slight fall will cause it to shatter. For the price point you‚Äôd think it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.,latinaprincess9,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,Loved the color but less than a week of using it broke and it¬¥s impossible to use it this way. Very disappointed.,vanepalau,24 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Prone to shattering,"It‚Äôs so fragile!! I caried it in my make up bag, inside my bag, and when I opened it, the product is already shattered.

really pigmented but is pretty,"i like this blush a lot, and i use it sometimes, but don't reach for it too much. its insanely pigmented, and when i put my brush on the compact the blush kind of goes everywhere. i like the colour but its SOO pigmented. i do think its a nice blush tho!! i got cheer.",graceisawesomee,23 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
The best just-pinched cheeks glow.,This blush is my absolute favorite. Cheers gives me this flush just-pinched cheeks.  It gives me the most beautiful luminous glow from within. This one knocks it out of the park for me.,LillyCuba,23 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
The BEST,"Seriously the best powder blush I've ever used! It is SO PRETTY, and so glowy! And does NOT accentuate texture. It's amazing! Get it now! It has replaced all of my other blushes because it's so good",,23 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
"Super pigmented, apply with moderation",Love the product as it‚Äôs like a two in one highlight and blush. SUPER pigmented so careful not to have a heavy hand,zoen12,23 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,Gifted by rarebeauty but I will be repurchasing. literally a new summer staple in my makeup bag. This blush is the PERFECT sunkissed/glowy look and is my new favorite. I‚Äôve been using liquid blushes but this one has me back on a powder kick.,beautyyy123,23 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,"I love this blush! It‚Äôs so beautiful and soft to use and blend. I do notice that it accentuates texture though, so I recommend using it on smooth areas only. I have the colors Truth and Joy, and while I love them, Joy just shows up like an Illuminator on me. If you‚Äôre tan or darker, try another one of the deeper peach shades for more color. Truth is stunning for my skin or deeper! Gifted by Rare Beauty",savannahceleste,23 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,Amazing product just way to fragile. Had it for 3 days and it broke,mariavictoriaa,23 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Shattering deception,"This is a beautiful product. However, i‚Äôve only had it for less than 2 weeks, and as i was using it this morning, it shattered right into my hands. This is ridiculous for a product of this price. People ran into the same issue with the highlighter, why haven‚Äôt they fixed it??? This makes it unusable, please fix it because i want to live it.",Lilynadeau,23 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Nope!,I never hated a product more. Emphasizes every pore and texture‚Ä¶. So blotchy and does not spread nicely. Also broke easily. I have returned it now.,jenjen133,22 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
A little goes a long way,This blush is so pretty and glowy! Just make sure to not apply too much at once. I do it in layers to make sure it blends nice and looks good! It lasts all day!,Stephanie0414,22 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Nothing but AMAZING,"The glow is soooo gorgeous, I got the shade happy and it‚Äôs honestly the perfect pink color for any fair-medium toned skin. LOVE, will repurchase forever.",kippyy,22 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

I have 2 shades now.  SUMMER MUST HAVES,I am in love with this product.  It's a sheer powder that just glides across my skin with a berry color.  It just melts right into my skin and is very buildable if you want it richer.  I also bought the Muted Peach which does the same thing.  I can't find any reason whatsoever to complain with that said BUY IT!!! You can't please everybody so if you are reading not so happy reviews just get for yourself and return if you don't like.,VedaMonroe,22 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Pass!,Swatches beautiful but it looks like a pink highlighter and not a blush. Not a fan. Not good for texture either since the shimmer makes your texture look worse. Returned it after the first use,ohlandezcoco,22 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Do not recommend,"This was honestly pretty bad. I love blushes and love the liquid ones, but the tones in this are VERY cool - like the highlight is blue and just not flattering at all on fairer skintones. It looks kind of cheap and uneven. Returning!",Kfeels,22 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Not a fan,"To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt wowed by this product & am slightly disappointed.

The product itself doesn‚Äôt have much pigment at all and goes on very",irelandgrace123,22 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Best blush/highlight duo in my opinion,"love love love this blush 

(one negative- definitely accentuates texture, when i have a pimple this makes the texture of my skin more noticeable but it‚Äôs not the end of the world)

i add it as a touch of highlight after my makeup routine is finished but before highlighter (if i even need it- this is pretty much highlighter anyway)",lolanette,22 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,Nice product but for almost 30 usd I expect better quality. Just got this today in the mail and it‚Äôs shattered. I‚Äôm returning this and not buying any other shade until the quality is improved. I love Rare but this is not acceptable.,Elviiuxx,21 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Broken product,I bought this today and came home opened the new box and the blush was completely broken,umariya,21 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Poor craftsmanship,This shade is very beautiful and looks great but the product itself is poor quality.  I accidentally dropped it on my bathroom counter and it didn't crack like perhaps another product would.  It literally exploded into a million pieces.  I have never experienced this with any similar product.  I have heard this is a common problem with Rare Beauty products.  Don't waste your money which i really hate saying but I'm being honest.,Julymomz,21 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Must have,I absolutely love it. It is a very glowy blush so I like to use it as either a topper or on top of liquid blush. This is VERY glowy so if you do not like a highlighted look this is not for you. It can enhance texture but if you do not mind that then you will love this,NicoleAMartins,20 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Patchy. Unblendable.,I learn my lesson. The marketing machine behind makeup is insane. The five star reviews are in exchange for free product. Those of us who actually paid for this give it 1-2 stars. Patchy. Unvlendable.,pao2310,20 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Nice blush,"I bought this because I love the color as I have light olive skin and wear warm colors a lot. One star off for it being a bit too glowy for my liking. I have to buff it down with a large face brush. Color payoff is good, its very pigmented, lasted for most of the day. I only apply in one layer otherwise I can see this becoming clown like.",twingrandma,17 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Glowy,"I purchased the shades Cheer and Joy in person at the store. My initial thoughts on Cheer was that it was too sheer on my teenager's fair skin. However, with a more dense brush, it really popped and was crazy pigmented. So the the type of brush used does matter!  Overall, Cheer complimented her skin and gave her a healthy glow. The formula is a pleasure to use and looks absolutely stunning. The shade Joy easily lasted on me at least 10 hours without fading. I'm in love with this glowy blush.",stellasmommy04,17 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

underwhelming‚Ä¶,"This product was offered by rarebeauty. This product was okay, it was underwhelming for me atleast. I expected a pigmented product like the rest of the rare beauty products and this product js didnt work like that.

So beautiful,"This was a perfect addition to the rare beauty line up! This product is the perfect blush topper to pair with their liquid blush line up, but also these go perfectly well on their own.

Beautiful warm shade,The color is just as it's liquid form is. It has a high pigment to it and feel soft to apply as well as blend out.  It has a different finish compared to the liquid blush. This finish is actually a bit sheer but glowy to it. It looks beautiful for a highlighted finish.

Loving Joy!,"Joy: A muted peach, this shade surprised me. The tone pulled more warm orange on me in a way that I felt was very flattering. I applied this blush in the same placement as the other and recommend a similar brush type as mentioned above. This shade however packs more of a punch pigment wise. I recommend going in with a lighter hand initially. This blush seems to have a pigment-shimmer ratio that I prefer. It is pigmented with a more subtle, but still noticeable shimmer. I like this better because I felt like the blush tone was more visible & the shimmer was less intense. I enjoy wearing this one on its own.",meganhowdy,13 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

I tried to use the product still and the color is great. It was just too messy to keep in my makeup bag. I ordered a second one paying for it myself. The second time, my blush arrived shattered from delivery. Ugh! Sephora customer service is great and they offered to ship me a replacement.

Subtle highlighter blush on medium skin tone,"My boyfriend gave me this blush, it's honestly very pretty, and for my skin color it's subtle.It doesn't have much pigmentation, so you can either combine it with other blushes or try to build up the pigment. I'm very grateful that it arrived safely, as it was delivered by courier. I think it's a matter of luck whether the blush arrives broken or not. I have a little texture on my skin, but I didn't notice it being accentuated (maybe because I used a moderate amount of blush). It definitely acts more like a highlighter, it reflects when you move. The only thing I expected was for it to have a bit more pigment and be less fragile, but overall, it's very beautiful.",Sushilover10,12 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

However, I am not overly impressed with be the wear of the blush. I do not wear foundation, reaching instead for a dewy SPF and sometimes a tinted moisturizer.

A little too luminous for me,"So for me, being on ""this side"" of 50, this blush - which probably looks gorgeous on younger, non textured skin, really accentuates all the ""bad stuff"" on my upper cheeks including crows feet, texture, etc.   So I did return it.   I get a similar result with less texture with the RMS Luminous Blushes.  I have a color called ""Bohemian Girl"" that is similar to Cheer but doesn't accentuate everything I'm trying not to.  Love Rare's liquid blushes and will stick to those.     xo",lyssy1493,12 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Sadly can‚Äôt use :(,I got this in two shades because i was anticipating loving this but both broke me out all over! if you have acne prone skin that‚Äôs a little on the sensitive side just be mindful of the ingredients. the color payoff was also not my favorite considering her liquid blushes.,alltimejenna,12 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,I have tried a few shades rhe of the new soft pinch luminous powder blushes and I really live how pigmented they are. The shade joy is especially pretty to go with the liquid blush. I like that this powder is like a blush meets highlighter and gives my cheeks a nice glowy and radiant appearance. I can definitely see myself using this all summer long. To avoid over emphasizing pores or textures I stay to the other part of my apples and use the liquid blush on the whole apple of my cheek. I definitely recommend to others.,fulltimesweety,12 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,The blush had a beautiful metallic effect on the skin I think it looked amazing I got it in the shade joy as a gifted product and I usually stay away from peachy shades but this one looked amazing on my skin a 10/10 product,linayahh,12 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,I love these new blushes! The finish is so radiant and glowy. I love wearing these on their own or layering them over the liquid blushes. I can‚Äôt get over how beautiful they look on. The formula is very soft and blendable. Packaging is cute but definitely be careful traveling with these as they do tend to crack if they get jostled. However that‚Äôs my only complaint about these. I love the pigmentation and how buildable it is. They look so beautiful in natural lighting and are a part of my everyday makeup routine now. Try them!,cheynam,12 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,"This powder blush is gorgeous! Yes, it looks very shimmery in the pan but it really just gives this beautiful luminous glow to your skin. It also sets the liquid blush nicely so it looks less dewy and more matte while still giving ""glowy"" and making your look really last all day. I feel like this blush gives the perfect gradient transition from where your highlighter strobes to this blush's soft shimmer down to whatever your base is so the whole look appears more cohesive instead of just having stark highlighter on an otherwise matte face. My blush came in the mail in perfect condition but I'd suggest buying it in store if you're worried about damage during shipping.",tm710,12 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Beautiful but way to easy to break,"These blushes are stunning, they look amazing on top of her liquid blushes. But they are WAY too fragile.

Wanted to love but was not worth the hype,"Wanted to love this so bad but it just doesn't sit well with other products. As a swatch it's stunning but it's either too shimmery on the front of the check and takes away from highlighting/ lifting the cheekbone, or you apply it higher and then you still need some form of product (liquid blush) on the front cheeks. Definetly emphasized any pores/blemishes. Guess I'm just a classic gold highlighter girl! Tried both this shade and hope.",Mika22,11 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Buy this now üíó,Let me start off with saying I was SO skeptical of this blush. I‚Äôm not a shimmery blush gal. I‚Äôm more of a dewy/satin. Because I love my highlighter and I don‚Äôt want too much going on my cheeks but these!! These are so beautiful and just soglowy. They give your cheeks the most radiant look without being too much. Some people were saying this is like a highlighter all over your cheek and no it is not! Give it a chance. Went back to Sephora and bought another one,RoyalButterfly,11 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Irritated by how gorgeous this is... and I'm 40+,"I had zero intention of buying this when I saw videos of these being swatched. 
I'm 44 and have dry skin with some texture and fine lines and I know a lot of people are turned off by how luminous these are but OH MY GOD, Joy and Truth are gorgeous! Swatched in-store and that sold me!
I put Joy on top of other peach or coral blushes and it gives the most healthy, juicy and lit from within glow. It actually makes the high points of my face appear a bit more full and juicy so it almost looks as though I got a small amount of filler, if that makes any sense. 
Applied in the wrong spot (on me- the apples of the cheeks),they would definitely emphasize texture but hey, I have skin and I'm over 40- it is what it is...
For reference, I disliked the Bare Minerals blonzers but these are so so so soft and velvety and the luminosity doesn't read as glitter but as shimmer-in my opinion.
I found the lighter pink colours to look a bit muddy since the pigment seemed a bit light for my skin tone and the highlight/reflect that showed through was also too light, almost leaving a cast. But Joy just looks like summer on my face and warms up my skin tone in the healthiest way.
I want to get Truth so badly but I'll wait until the Winter sale if I can curb my impulse to buy it right away :) Swatched lightly, Truth was absolutely gorgeous. Swatched on top of other blushes and it was just phenomenal!",WafflesnOJ,10 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

While I haven't tried it with the dedicated brush yet, I can imagine it would only enhance the already flawless application process.

,"I wasn't sure how this blush would look on my textured, acne-prone skin. But I am pleasantly surprised how wearable this blush is. The shade Joy is a beautiful burnt peachy shade. I like to keep the blush further back towards my cheekbones and tap over it with a sponge to reduce some of the reflective shine. These blushes are definitely glow, so they may not be everyone's preference. But I don't find them to be unflattering.",CaitYates,10 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Gorgeous color,This product was gifted to me by rarebeauty for review and I am surprised by the results. I used the shade ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù which is a very pigmented and sparkly pink.

I thought ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way the other blush can top this‚Äù I was wrong. I seriously just love both equally. I can‚Äôt stand blush‚Äôs that don‚Äôt appear natural like you‚Äôve been sunkissed and you have to apply a ton of product for the color to show. This is not the case with rare beauty. The smallest dab of product goes such a long way! I can‚Äôt recommend this enough just buy it!,,10 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

The only blush you need to buy this spring,"I was initially intimidated by the peach color(Joy) I received. It just looked SO orange in the pan, and I‚Äôm wary about luminous blushes because I don‚Äôt want to accentuate texture on my cheeks. However, after swatching it on my hand, I fell in love. The powder melts into the skin and creates such a gorgeous dimension of color. Seriously, don‚Äôt sleep on Rare‚Äôs powder formulas. They go on so silky and don‚Äôt emphasize my textured cheeks. If you buy one blush this spring, make it this new luminous blush in Joy. It gives a universally flattering warmth to the face, and the peach tone couldn‚Äôt be more on trend.",soro47,10 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Beautiful blush!!,"I love this blush; I liked the Rare beauty liquid blushes but I find they are very pigmented even if you only use a little bit and then by the time you add powder and set everything you need to add a powder blush on top. This is the perfect addition to any liquid blush. I am very pale and usually cool toned products look better on me and the shade Happy compliments my skin tone very well. This adds the perfect shimmer to where you don't need highlighter and even if you don't like or use highlighter you can go in with a light hand and it won't be too overpowering. These are quite buildable in a good way! The only thing I will say is if you have large pores or textured skin this might emphasize texture so be careful. Besides that, I 10/10 recommend.",madsmorr,10 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

I am reading some of the reviews which states ‚Äúnot for every day use‚Äù or doesn‚Äôt last long- IMO these blushes are for every day use, if you wear highlighter and blush, these gems are for you. They do last a very long time. My makeup lasts all day long and then some. These blushes are absolutely stunning, the formula is soft and silky, It‚Äôs not a blush that you rub on your skin with a brush, you need to gently swipe. These are definitely worth the purchase, especially if you use blush and highlighter.",Msjess81,8 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Gorgeous!!,The glow on this blush is unreal. I think it‚Äôs really hard to find a blush that looks almost irridescent and this blush does it perfectly. I really didn‚Äôt think they could do better than their liquid blush but this really is something else. The blush is shimmery but I love that it adds some more dimension to my face. The color joy is absolutely beautiful. For reference I have joy in the liquid version as well and it‚Äôs not as bright and a little more muted but it works really well with my tan skin. I will be purchasing these in the rest of the colors. I highly recommend. This was complimentary from rarebeauty,n18364916393727,8 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
For those who want bold colour and highlight,Loving it so far. The blush colour is pigmented and the highlight is strong. Not for people who want a subtle glow.

I find this adds the perfect sheen to the skin and makes me look glowy! I really like this one and think it would work for all skin types/looks.,DanaE94,7 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
An almost obnoxious amount of glitter,"*Purchased myself 
Knowing how much I dislike the powder highlight, I shouldn't have purchased this blush but I took a chance and I regret it. Like the highlight, this blush so intensely glittery, almost obnoxiously so, that even with a light hand and buffing it into my skin, my cheeks are covered in sparkles. It emphasized pores and fine lines I don't even have. The shade Happy is light pink but warmer than the liquid blush version, with more ""shine"" than color as the pigmentation isn't very buildable...unless I wanted even more glitter on my face. 
Makeup is extremely subjective and clearly people love this but it's not for me. I'm already very fair, I don't need blush making me look like a Twilight vampire when I step into the sun.",cara80,7 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Rare beauty blush,The blush was cute. I don‚Äôt like shimmery products on the skin especially a powder. If you are into highlighters you‚Äôll love it. The color is nice I just wish it was a matte blush. I was gifted by rare beauty in exchange for a review.,Leechelle,7 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
So shimmery!,"This is like a highlighter and blush in one product! I can use this powder blush on its own for a beautiful super glowy look!

It was so pigmented that the product would end up lasting me a few months. They blended out seamlessly with a brush, beauty blender, or simply my finger. I found that if there was too much pigment, I would take a damp beauty blender and lightly pat the area until it was diffused to my liking. I'm happy I went with a darker shade because it looks stunning with a bronzer laid underneath. I will definitely be buying these in more shades!",ABBYG3,7 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Perfect blush for summer,"Truth is a very light but pigmented blush, you don‚Äôt need a lot of product to achieve the perfect look, it‚Äôs very luminous and perfect for summer, if you have large pores it might show more texture than normal but aside from that I would give truth, 10/10. #giftedbyrarebeauty",joannaIVM,6 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Wish it didn‚Äôt come shattered!,"So sad that my blush came shattered, confirms they are just as fragile as the highlighters. Swatched beautiful but unfortunately I was not able to use it on my cheeks, I hope they make matte ones in the future!",dhnaum,6 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Lovely bright peach,"Beautiful glowy highlighting blush. I don‚Äôt usually go for powders as much because I have drier skin, but the shine and texture of this one works for me and also layers well with more natural finish cream blushes. Joy is definitely a bright happy coral/peach so I use a light hand with a brush on my fair/light skin tone. Lasting power and pigmentation seems pretty good and it doesn‚Äôt accentuate my texture, though I do have smaller pores in that area of my face.

Stunning color and highly pigmented,"#gifted_by_RareBeauty to provide my honest opinion on the Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Blush in the shade Joy. First off, the pigment in these blushes are unbeatable. Since they are so pigmented, this product will last me a few months making the price totally reasonable. I blended the product out with a damp beauty blender until I liked the amount of pigment. It really helped to add some warmth and color to my face after applying foundation and concealer. I highly recommend this product and will be buying again!",ALG111,6 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Great as long as you know what you‚Äôre getting,"Gifted by Rare Beauty in exchange for my review. I think there's some important things to consider about this product if you're debating picking it up. I would describe these more as a blush-highlighter hybrid, leaning more toward being a highlight. Essentially, if you've tried their powder highlighters, these are them but just with blush pigments added to them. The shimmers in these are visible on the skin, especially in direct sunlight so if that's not your vibe you should skip these for now.",Sarakate2,6 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,"This is gorgeous ! It is way more pigmented than I expected , so start off with a light hand ! I like using it on top of the liquid blush for more color. It gives a great illuminating glow to the cheeks and lasted all day with little fade ! The lighter shades are definitely more of a highlighter than a blush, which is why I recommend using over liquid / cream blush.",abbbsss3,6 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Luminous with a bit of sparkle,"I bought this in Cheer and Hope. I have light skin with yellow undertones, and Cheer looks peach and Hope a warm neutral. Both shades are beautiful with just a bit of sparkle. I‚Äôm 45 so generally shy away from glitter on my face. This blush/highlighter combo is just right",metrocard,6 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
So smooth and buttery!,I was sooo stoked about getting my hands on this! Beautiful texture and the powder is so fine!!! Tbh it reminds me of a more expensive luxury highlighter blush that i own.

Happy - the perfect pink blush,"I have the powder highlighter, and I thought that product was smooth and almost creamy the way it laid on skin, I was expecting the same with the blushes. Pleasantly surprised that the powder blushes actually perform even better. I bought Happy and Joy, and Happy is amazing. Haven‚Äôt tested Joy yet but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs good too. Anywho happy is the perfect pink. Not too blue in the base and just warm enough to give me the perfect pink that I have been looking for.",Elysha,6 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Love,"Pretty and very glowy. Some people won't love these because they dislike metallic blushes, but they're stunning. I had a hard time picking a shade to start off with, and chose Hope. To me it's the most neutral of the range. By no means is it a wallflower shade, though. This is beautiful. Sheer enough, but buildable. Just as soft as the highlighter powders. Be careful you don't drop these.",IslaCarys,6 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
gorgeous gorgeous blush,"I immediately bought this blush when it released and it did not disappoint! It‚Äôs a beautiful peachy color that just makes you look effortlessly sun kissed and bronzed.

Gorgeous blushlighter by Selena,"Beautiful product overall. You NEED to apply this to powdered cheeks- applying to a wet base will result in a very patchy appearance.

Huh?,"This blush has NO pigment. It's basically a sheer shimmer eyeshadow. It applies like a veil of barely tinted fine glitter that disappears as you blend.
I'm so confused by this product. It feels nice and soft in its pan but there's zero color payoff and it's so shimmery it could be labeled as a highlighter. Cheer is supposed to be Selena's shade but it's extremely light. I'm much paler than her and it wouldn't be a blush color on me (if it had any payoff).",LulleBeaumiroir,5 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,"I received this product complimentary from Rare Beauty in exchange for my honest review. I was worried this blush would be too glowy for my textured, acne-prone skin. However I find the best way for me to use this is to apply it on my cheekbones rather than over the pores on the apples of my cheeks. I also like to tap over the blush with a sponge to take down some of the shine. This blush is truly stunning and doesn‚Äôt overly emphasize texture. However if you apply it over pores, it will definitely make them more noticeable. I also appreciate that there isn‚Äôt any glitter in the blush.",CaitYates,4 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Flawless,"Another winner from Rare Beauty! The blushes are a very soft, easy to blend, formula, perfect for any skin tone! My usage tips are 1) buy their brush, it blends it much better and more beautifully; and 2) avoid any area of texture. The highlight will make any texture pop, so choose a smooth area of skin (right under eyes where cheeks meet eye area), for a perfectly flattering highlight! Gifted by Rare Beauty.",savannahceleste,4 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
goes on beautifully but doesn‚Äôt last !!,"i was so excited for this, i went to three sephoras and they didn‚Äôt have it so i ordered it online. it arrived broken, which i should‚Äôve expected bc the highlighters are the same way. i‚Äôm extremely fair and i found that this is more buildable than intensely pigmented which i don‚Äôt mind, but i wonder how any colors except the deepest two would show up on deep complexions. i have it vvv built up in photo. it also faded extremely fast. a lot of people are mentioning that its texture enhancing but it‚Äôs literally a luminous blush, it‚Äôs going to pick up on texture. i don‚Äôt mind that i just don‚Äôt like that it doesn‚Äôt last. i usually use a cream underneath so im going to keep it because it‚Äôs beautiful while it‚Äôs there. if you don‚Äôt use creams and are only looking for a powder blush thats punchy and lasts this isn‚Äôt it.",dinkyred,4 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Beautiful but broken- twice,"Pros:
The product itself is a home run, it‚Äôs stunning! I‚Äôve been looking for a glowy blush for a while and have tried many other more expensive brands (Hourglass being one), and this one is the best by far. It‚Äôs a true glow without chunky glitter. You can forego highlighter with this,and using a light hand will give you a fresh, natural look. The packaging is just like the highlighters, small, round and dome shaped. Would be easy to travel with (but more on that below). 

Cons:
It‚Äôs not the product that‚Äôs the issue, it‚Äôs the packaging. It‚Äôs such a delicate formula it shatters almost without any assistance. In part this can be caused by rough shipping, but in part it is the design of the product also. If it were made into a flat shape vs a dome or pressed more, it would likely have a better chance of survival. I‚Äôve bought 2 rare beauty highlighters and they are my favorite, but they break immediately and therefore you cannot travel with them.  It‚Äôs super disappointing because they are AMAZING products but they WILL break.",Lvrh8me,4 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,"gifted by rare beauty for review! after loving the powder highlights i knew i would absolutely love this formula too! these have the prettiest baked formula that looks luminous and glowy on the skin. these apply super smooth, i don‚Äôt find any chunky shimmer or glitter in the formula.",makeup122,4 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,"I love this product and I love the color! I really wasn't expecting to love a peachy orange or a brown color so much especially because I always go for the baby girl pink blushes. But this shade complimented my skin SO well. It is like a natural sun burn color. It also works as a contour and highlighter, because it has baby gold flecks in it. So radiant. Also, lasts ALL day. Some powder blushes are drying but this applied so easily. The powder is as pigmented as liquid blushes.",babyfluff01,4 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Just okay.,"This blush is okay. It‚Äôs extremely soft, and I had trouble opening the compact and when I did, I accidentally jabbed my nail in the product. It‚Äôs VERY sheer. I‚Äôve been on a blush kick lately and this on its own doesn‚Äôt pack enough punch, and I have incredibly fair skin. I use it as a blush topper, which is nice. Not sure if I‚Äôd recommend it, unless you‚Äôre wanting something very subtle.",mgjone,4 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Total miss/very patchy/too much sparkle,"Not a fan of rare beauty blushes because they‚Äôre just too pigmented but when i saw a powder version i got so excited! Typically I‚Äôm not one for a very glittery blush but the photos/swatches got me. Picked up two shades, love & happy but only tried happy. Immediately there was no color pay off & it was insanely patchy; but at the same time it was super sparkly. This worked more like a highlighter & not a blush. Everything else I‚Äôve tried from rare beauty has been excellent but her blushes are just not it. Returned immediately.",hdyrj,4 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Subpar to Haus Labs,"Bought this for my gf....to say she was mad would be an understatement. She complained that it was very patchy and did not ""hold well in the pan"".

Absolutely not worth the hype,"Not sure how this has 5 stars tbh. It seems like most positive reviews are written by people who received the product for free, but this blush was a major letdown. I was super excited when i heard rare was finally coming out with powder blushes, but this is more of a highlight than blush - and not a very forgiving one. This will emphasize any slight texture you might have so bad. I don't usually ever have that problem on my cheeks and it just looked awful in every lighting. On top of the texture issue, the color looked very muddy on my skin tone, which was unfortunate because i loveee the liquid blush in the same shade.",tols,3 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

"Shimmery , more like a  pigmented highlight.","These are very silky to the touch. Very similar to the highlighter formula. These are very luminous too. It appears as if they have fine mica in them, so they do have a somewhat shimmery effect. The pigment is very buildable and the formula blends out quite nice, but like many luminous products, it will emphasize texture if you have large pores . I find these to be really pretty but I wouldn‚Äôt use highlighter to top it off. They are almost a blush /highlighter hybrid. So adding highlighter is unnecessary. It Layers well on top the soft pinch liquid blush. Actually, I feel like I like using the soft pinch liquid blush as the pigment/blush and then using this to top off more where highlight would be placed. The color joy is a warm peach. I prefer to use only 1-2 swipes  of this on my lighter skin, perhaps in the summer I could build up the pigment more. The packaging is similar to the highlighters but matte. Love the minimalist aesthetic. In the picture I have a swatch of cheer and joy so you can see what one swipe of color looks light on my light skin with neutral undertones.",MarissaIwanowsk,3 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,"This blush is GORGEOUS. I love that it has a little bit of shimmer in it because I rarely use a highlight when I apply this to my cheeks. It gives the perfect sun-kissed glow. I like blushes that I can wear when I don‚Äôt have a full face of makeup on, and I feel like this one is natural enough that I can do just that. I like the texture of the blush too because it applies easily but definitely has a stronger pigment so you don‚Äôt need much. Gifted by rarebeauty",steviegidden,3 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Eh not what i was hoping for,I ordered three of these and one of them was completely broken in shipment. I wanted to love them but they‚Äôre more of a colored highlighter than a luminous blush if that makes sense:/ just a personal preference though,kylie0505,3 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Nothing revolutionary,It‚Äôs kind of a meh product honestly. I dislike the color I ordered and that‚Äôs on me. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll exchange it for a different color. The formula is really not anything special and it‚Äôs VERY metallic. It‚Äôs basically just the highlighter in their blush colors.,kdea547,3 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

the perfect healthy radiance,"OMGGG, best hybrid everrrr. the shade is perfect for my skin tone and looks radiant and natural at the same time.

Back to the basics! Powder blush for the win,"#rarebeautygiftedme As soon as I received the Soft Pinch Blush a week ago, I incorporated it into my everyday routine. I gave myself a week of use to really get a sense of the wearability and practicality of it.

After one week of daily use, I can tell you that this blush is something I will continue to reach for. It is easily blendable and buildable but does not fade away throughout the day like many other formulas I have tried. It also has this slight radiant finish that I LOVE!! I‚Äôve previously only used matte blush formulas but I‚Äôm loving the sun-kissed look the radiance gives. It works wonderfully with a full face of foundation AND when I just want to throw some blush on over a bare face. I have a medium olive skin tone and normally reach for lighter pink shades, so I was a little nervous to try this peachy shade but it did not disappoint at all!!! The shade truly works on many skin types (I tried it on my sister who has a more fair complexion and my best friend who has a deeper complexion). When I am wearing full foundation, I use the Rare Beauty liquid blush version (in the same shade) and then pair the powder version on top once I‚Äôve applied all my powders. They work so beautifully together but can also be used separately. For example, when it‚Äôs a bare face day, I use just the powder and it lasts me all day!! 10/10 recommend, can‚Äôt wait to try out the other shades!!",gabrielamykah27,3 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Better as a topper,"I received 2 shades, Hope & Joy. So far my experience with each has been different lol. In this review I‚Äôm showcasing the shade Hope. I found this shade to lack actual pigmentation. On my cheek the majority of what was visible was bright pink shimmer. If I tried to build up the blush for more pigment all I would get is moreeee shimmer. I felt the actually color pay off of this shade to be very minimal and the shimmer to be very intense. I think the particular shade Hope will work best as a topper than an actual blush in terms of my preferences. This however was not my experience with the shade Joy. I have to submit that one separately. This product was gifted by rare beauty.",meganhowdy,2 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,"I‚Äôm usually not a fan of shimmery blushes and prefer the Soft Pinch Liquid Blush from Rare Beauty. However, I quite enjoy Rare Beauty‚Äôs newest release- Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush. It has a remarkably creamy texture, similar to a cream blush rather than a powder. It‚Äôs shimmery, but not glittery, and gives me the most gorgeous glow.

Luminous,"Soft pinch luminous powder blush (Joy shade)  has a nice muted peach shade but I don‚Äôt think it suits my light complexion.

Silky formula,"Soft pinch luminous powder blush in the shade happy has a beautiful cool pink shade and suits my light complexion. The formula Is silky and easy to work with and I think these lean towards the highlighter be of how reflective the finish is. You can easily build the intensity of color, but then the luminosity Might be too strong. I think this blush is more suitable for a full glam makeup look. Gifted by rare beauty",Ausra90,1 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Not half bad,"I‚Äôve never been more in love with a blush and that‚Äôs saying a lot as this was gifted by rare beauty. The powder is luminous without emphasizing pores or texture. To be honest, the liquid blushes from Rare are so pigmented, so I hardly ever reach for the shade I have. I like products I can apply with ease that look effortless.

"Shimmery, silky to the touch","I love the packaging , matte and pretty minimalist. This is more like a Blush/highlighter combo  because of its luminosity. A little less natural though because it doesn‚Äôt give a dewy finish but rather a reflective, radiant, shimmery one. Pigment is buildable. Not long wearing without being set , I find they rub/wear away if I don‚Äôt use a setting spray. The color cheer is a beautiful icy pink. Pretty on my light skin and buildable for when my complexion is more tan in the summer. I use on top of liquid blush almost as a highlighter more than blush. I recommend for those who like glam, this definitely doesn‚Äôt give a natural aesthetic.",MarissaIwanowsk,1 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Perfect combo of blush and highlight .,"I was lucky enough to be gifted by Rare Beauty their new Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush in the shade ""Hope"". Let me break down why this gem has become an indispensable staple in my makeup routine.

So let's talk about the innovative formulation of this luminous powder blush. It's like having a blush and highlighter rolled into one, providing the perfect balance of color and glow. The seamless blend of pigments and shimmering pearls creates a radiant finish that truly mimics a lit-from-within glow. I love how it effortlessly enhances my complexion, adding a pinch-perfect flush that instantly enlivens my skin.

One of the standout features of this blush is its buildable nature. Whether I'm going for a subtle hint of color or a more intense flush, the Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush delivers every time. Its lightweight texture allows for easy layering without ever looking cakey or heavy, ensuring a natural, seamless finish that lasts all day.But the magic doesn't stop there. 

Rare Beauty has also prioritized clean beauty with this product, formulating it without parabens, phthalates, sulfates, and other harmful ingredients. As someone who values both performance and safety in my beauty products, knowing that this blush is cruelty-free and free of harsh chemicals gives me peace of mind.In terms of application, the pressed powder format makes it incredibly user-friendly, allowing for precise placement and effortless blending. Whether I'm using a fluffy brush for a diffused look or my fingertips for a more concentrated application, the Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush never disappoints.

Rare Beauty has knocked it out of the park with their Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush in the shade ""Hope."" With its radiant finish, buildable coverage, and clean formulation, it's a true multitasking marvel that has earned a permanent place in my makeup collection. Whether you're a beauty enthusiast or a makeup minimalist, this blush is sure to become your new go-to.",PrincessOnABudg,1 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Perfect to pair with the liquid blush,"A beautiful formula, very luminizing i must say. I use the Rare Beauty brush to apply. I feel Cheer is much more glowy, like a blush topper, so I like to pair it with Encourage liquid blush. Gifted by Rare Beauty.",aalava,1 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Kind of dissatisfied with this drop :/,"I was really excited for the drop of Rare Beauty's highlighter, thinking it'd be the game-changer for my oily complexion, especially with summer on the horizon. My hopes were high for this to be the magic solution, but it ended up being a bit of a disappointment. Yeah, it looks amazing before you use it and it does give your face a nice glow, but it also highlights uneven skin more than I'd like.The quality of the highlighter itself is really solid. You can tell they put effort into making it feel premium and blend well. However, it fell short by emphasizing the uneven parts of my skin, which was exactly what I didn't want. People with smoother skin will probably get a kick out of how it enhances their features. But for someone with texture issues like me, it kind of feels like it's just drawing attention to what you're trying to hide.In the end, even with all the good stuff about Rare Beauty's highlighter, I've got to pass on it. It's a great product for sure, just not suited for folks with textured skin. The search for the ideal summer highlighter goes on for me, but now I've got a better idea of what to look for and what to steer clear of for my skin type.",Naydwan,1 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Beautiful!,"I received this soft pinch powder blush complimentary from Rare beauty and it‚Äôs such a beautiful product!

I want it in every color now  gifted by rare beauty,129amym,1 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Not for me :/,"I was super pumped about Rare Beauty's new highlighter. I've got oily skin and thought this powder would be awesome when it gets hot out. I was hoping this would be the one, but it kinda let me down. Sure, it looks great in the pan and even makes your face light up in a cool way, but it also made my skin's rough patches stick out more than I wanted.The stuff in the highlighter is pretty top-notch; it's obvious they tried to make something that feels good on your skin and is easy to use. But, it did the one thing I didn't want it to do ‚Äì made my bumpy skin more noticeable. If you've got smooth skin, you'll probably love how it shines and brings out your best bits. But if you're dealing with skin like mine, it might just point out the stuff you're trying to play down.So, even though Rare Beauty's highlighter has some great things going for it, I have to say it's not for me. It's a shame because it's a really nice product, just not right for someone dealing with skin texture issues. I'm still on the hunt for that perfect highlighter for the warmer months, but now I know a bit more about what works and what doesn't for my skin.",Naydwan,1 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Fascinated!,"The Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush in Joy was gifted by RareBeauty and Skeepers in exchange for my honest review.
This is such a beautiful blush, with a natural plumping effect and extremely cute colors that have made many women fascinated. It is unexpectedly smooth and incredibly weightless. This blush is as smooth as silk, giving the feeling of dissolving and blending smoothly into the skin immediately upon application. Besides, it also adds emulsion, so when applied to the cheeks, it will create the effect of naturally flushed and plump cheeks. The most attractive point of this blush is that it is easy to stick to and long-lasting with a natural-looking dimension. I love the design in a cute small, compact box, easy to carry anywhere, especially when traveling. 
Thank you RareBeauty and Skeepers for giving me this wonderful product.",heoconthongminh,31 Mar 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

,"""Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush: Prepare to be gently slapped in the face with disappointment! This blush promises a 'soft pinch,' but let me tell you, it's more like a full-on punch to the ego. Instead of a luminous glow, I ended up looking like I just ran a marathon in a sauna. The powder clung to every pore and crevice, giving me that coveted 'sweaty mess' look‚Äîminus the endorphins. It's like someone ground up a disco ball and sprinkled it on my cheeks, leaving me shimmering like a misguided attempt at a human Christmas ornament. And the color? Let's just say I went from 'subtle flush' to 'overcooked lobster' real quick. If you're looking for a blush that screams 'I've made a terrible mistake,' then congratulations, you've found it! 0 out of 5 stars for making me question every life choice that led me to purchase this unholy compact.""",Mateocici,30 Mar 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes

Amazing quality!,"I‚Äôve been hearing about Rare Beauty‚Äôs blush online for a while, and it‚Äôs definitely worth the hype! This powder blush is super pigmented and incredibly long-lasting. It almost feels waterproof with its high-quality formula. Give it a try, it‚Äôs a gamechanger! (Gifted by RareBeauty)",Bunnysdeals,30 Mar 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Amazing !,I was gifted by Rare Beauty. This blush gives you the best inner glow. It‚Äôs buildable to give more pigment or it can be light as well. Good for no makeup days or full on glam days. I love it so much it‚Äôs amazing.,aleynaariana,30 Mar 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
The best for summer !,I was gifted by Rare Beauty. This is the best blush I have ever used. It gives you the perfect buildable pigment & an instant glow. It‚Äôs going to be even more perfect in the summer. I love it so much. I even used some on my eyelids.,aleynaariana,30 Mar 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
Beautiful glow,"Such a lovely shade of bright mauve pink that I think would look good on a variety of skin tones. I usually go for cream blushes because I have dry skin, but the texture of this powder was really smooth and not drying or patchy on me. Plus the shimmer and luminosity of this still gave me my desired look. It‚Äôs definitely buildable which you can see if swatched with fingers, but blended well and still deposited a lot of pigment with a blush brush. I like to layer over more matte cream blushes as well like a highlighter. I‚Äôd be interested in trying more colors :) Gifted by Rare Beauty",daybrighten,30 Mar 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
A summer staple,I got the blush in the color Joy. It looks so good on my tan skin! You can use as a nice glow on its own or you can layer it on top of the rare beauty liquid blush. You can also build on it which is nice for an everyday pop of color without it being too dramatic. I‚Äôm definitely going to be using this more in the summer! Gifted by rarebeauty,dimpleepatel,30 Mar 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
,This blush is absolutely stunning! The pigment isn‚Äôt super intense but definitely still prominent and easily build able. I was worried the shimmer would be too much but I was pleasantly surprised!

Beautiful but not a stand-alone blush,"Really pretty if you‚Äôre looking for a nice luminous blush. Personally I don‚Äôt find it quite pigmented enough to be a stand-alone blush (unless you like very natural). It could be because I bought a light colour

,"This blush in the shade Hope was gifted by Rare Beauty in exchange for an honest review. This formula is extremely glowy but picks up less easily than their highlighters (where just one dab can be way too much). In my books that's a good thing as I could build up the color intensity slowly. Because it is so glowy it looked a bit metallic when I really built up the color, but I didn't find my pores to be emphasized more than usual with a glowy blush.  The formula seemed less shiny and glossy than their highlighter formula which I was relieved by. The shade Hope has a slightly warmer base with cool pink reflects. I can see the pink shine on my face still, and if that type of duochrome is not for you, I'd go for a different shade.",TeresaAntonia,28 Mar 2024,RareBeauty,Blush,Yes
