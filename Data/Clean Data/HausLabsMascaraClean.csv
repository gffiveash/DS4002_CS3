Clumpy,amnellen,"Not great. I noticed small clumps when I first started using it but they were small so I could work them out. But it's just gotten worse and I've only had it open for maybe two weeks. I'm disappointed and won't be repurchasing. With that said, when I get the clumps out I do like how light this feels on my lashes and how they look. But the clumps will keep me from purchasing again. Such a bummer",05 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
It's a basic mascara,itsmykingdom,"The packaging is sleek, and I appreciate that the mascara didn’t smudge or run throughout the day. However, beyond that, it felt pretty basic. I've been using it for about a week, and while I can't speak to any long-term lash benefits, it didn’t do much for my lashes in terms of volume or length.

It’s not a bad product—it performs like any standard mascara—but it lacks the wow factor I'd expect at this price point. Honestly, I’ve found drugstore mascaras that deliver better results for less. If you're considering buying this, I’d recommend thinking twice. Chances are, whatever mascara you’re currently using does just as much, if not more.

If you're a big supporter of the brand, I get it—but if you’re just curious, save your money.",05 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Amazing mascara. New favourite.,Mandster,Coats every lash. Super black. Easy to remove. Love!,05 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
zero stars - it give nothing but flakes,Mio01,"I bought the sample size with my points. The brush gets clumped up with the product. At first, it looks good, but within 5 minutes, the curl in my lashes is gone. without it, my lashes stayed curled on their own. within two hours of wear, it's like you never even put o mascara, and it's all flaked onto your face.",05 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,lunatickx0,Amazing!!! Does wonders for my tiny baby lashes ! & SUPER black,05 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Disappointing,lili221,"This was so disappointing! There was so much hype online about the mascara, and I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it. It did absolutely nothing for my lashes and I ended up returning it. :(",05 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,dulc3mi3l,"I love it, it doesn't fall out, my eyelashes look voluminous.",04 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Raccoon eyes!,soakes,I was shocked at how poorly this performed. I don’t use mascara on my bottom lashes and I’ve never had a mascara transfer and flake onto my under eyes. I applied as I normally do and within a couple hours my under eyes were blackened,04 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,BBLor,"Lengthened and added volume, really pretty mascara!
Didn't flake or clump for me, but I didn't over-apply it.",04 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Nothing special,Oli0402,"Used this a couple of times and didn’t notice anything special about my lashes. I will be returning. Didn’t lengthen or give any volume, drug store mascara is way better!",04 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Flake city,DiandraLynn,"The formula dries very fast so when you attempt to add more coats, it begins to cause flakes. Disappointed. I had high hopes. Listen to the reviews on this product.",03 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,mlandpeach,"Fantastic mascara! I have short, straight, thin, and blonde lashes. No mascara has ever made it look like I was wearing falsies. However, this one is one of the best I've tried. My eyes are kind of sensitive but have no issues with this mascara. I get the best volume and length any mascara has given me, and there's NO flaking or smearing. On my hooded eyes, mascara often smears on my upper eye area. I want COLORS!",03 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,hyphenwinter,"Lashes fell flat immediately, which never happens to me. Bummer formula.",03 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,RNdani,"Love this. It is my favorite mascara ever! Would love a brown one. If you’re thinking about getting, definitely do!",03 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Real lash look!,TereeCI,Love it!  One coat does a good job at tinting my lashes without liking like I have any mascara on. Buildable and lengthens ! I do wish there was a water proof one.,03 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Caused eye irritation,nicolekorissa,"Was super excited and wanted to love it, but fell short of the hype. The wand shape made it hard to get even coats, and after a week of using it, my eyelids started getting irritated. I have pretty long natural lashes, so maybe this wasn’t the right type of mascara for me. My lashes didn’t hold much of a curl with this either.",03 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
I didn’t experience the hype!,candacelouise,I didn’t experience the hype! It was ok. I found it ok and equal to most drug store brands.,02 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,gabz88,"Not worth the hype at all. Made my eyelashes really dry and did nothing for the length. I wanted a comparison to the Charlotte Tilbury mega exagger, and it failed next to that one.",02 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Not ‘As Advertised.’,HayzeMoneyy,Extremely disappointed by the wand! It doesn’t ‘lengthen’ as advertised; I only noticed a difference in thickness. Definitely recommend a different mascara for a more natural my lashes but better elongated look.,02 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
"Love the final result, don’t love the wand.",sydneydice,"Docking one star because I don’t love the little nub at the tip of the wand. I feel like it made application messy in my corners, so I had to do a bit of cleanup with a q-tip. I do love the final outcome of the length and volume it added though. Unsure if I will buy it in full size(got the small sample with rewards points)",02 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,Tavyy,"Had high hopes, but its not good. There are better options out there for this price point.",02 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Too heavy and too wet,Klc15,"I wanted to love this mascara after all the hype and before/after pics. But for me, it was way too wet. It took the curl completely out of my lashes and weighed them down. They went from curled to completely straight in one swipe.",02 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Lazy girl approved,Isabele93,"I think this mascara is AMAZING! I don’t curl my lashes- don’t have time, so to find a mascara that all I have to do is apply and my lashes look bomb is fantastic! 10/10 recommend if your a lazy girl like me just looking for a great mascara",01 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Not worth the price so basic,MakeupM25,This mascara is a flop for me. I naturally have curled lashes and the formula somehow weighed them down and my lashes were pointing down. I usually only do 2 coats which I think is the standard. Will definitely be returning,01 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,ChelsBCR,It’s really not that great! There are much better mascaras.,01 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
It’s a great mascara!,Magaliii,"I love this mascara, whenever I take off my makeup I am not struggling to rub it off which is really nice. With most mascaras I’ve tried, it’s always hard to rub off and then I lose lashes in the process. I don’t have to deal with that anymore so I am happy (:
The only downside is that it flakes a bit by the end of the day. I don’t really care about that but if you’re really picky with your mascara then maybe  should not try it.d",01 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
I love this but need a waterproof formula,Dusty36,I love this! I just wish it came in a waterproof formula. I only give it four stars bc I can't wear it on my bottom lashes without it smearing under my eyes. My eyes water really bad especially in the winter months.,01 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Very disappointing!,SuzsannaHK,"So disappointing - should have returned it!  Dry, clumpy, flakes off within hours.  One of the worst mascaras I've ever used. Sticking with my Bobbi Brown!",01 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Average mascara,Rachlovin,It’s just ok. I’ll use the whole product and probably buy something else. It’s not the best but also not the worst. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive eyes.,01 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,1991MandiCox,Great for lengthening and volume but looked like a raccoon at the end of the day. Super sad,01 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Stellar,julesjuls,Love this mascara. I’ve gone through several vegan mascaras in the past year not being fully satisfied. This is the first one that I feel like actually delivers on its promise. I feel like a lot of work went into this formula. It def Len goformula.Itfdoes for,01 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Had High Hopes,annachronismuss,"I really wanted to love this mascara. It felt amazing on, I love the packaging, but it flakes REALLY badly and bleeds onto the undereye. It's giving raccoon eyes. :( This reminds me 100% of the milk makeup Kush mascara - both are great but give them 5 minutes and they'll flake or smudge. :(",01 Feb 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,emaugustperry,"As someone with sensitive eyes, I love a clean mascara! Great for daily wear but also buildable and bold for the night. Will definitely be keeping in my makeup bag :)",31 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Not for me!,HYPEmom1968,"Unfortunately this caused a major allergic reaction. If you have sensitive skin or eyes, I wouldn't recommend. Hope it works better for everyone else. Was really looking forward to something new",31 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Love at first sight butttt,Ericasmommy,My lashes didn’t stay up and ended up weighing￼ them down. I even curled them before. when I curly my eyelashes without any mascara they will stay up most of the day & never have a problem with mascara weighing my eyelashes down,31 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Long and feathered lashes!,beautyel,Love how long and feathered this makes my lashes look! It is a great mascara for anyone who doesn’t like clumpy mascara. It doesn’t smudge under my eyes like like other mascaras do. I also like that I can build it up with multiple layers for a night out.,31 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Great for volume,BabyDre,"I was recently gifted by @hauslabs 
The New B Structural Volumizing and Lengthening Mascara. I’ve been testing out for a few weeks now so let’s talk about it. This Mascara has a two sided brush that allows you to create volume and length. The formula itself makes my lashes look darker, thicker and gives them a nice amount of volume. I really like the overall look it creates.
This mascara is meant to be long wearing but not waterproof. 
When it comes to mascaras I find that a lot of them end up rubbing off or flaking. I do find that this mascara rubs off after a few hours and leaves a little bit of a stain on my under eyes.",31 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,Elizabeth8889,"I had seen several good reviews of this mascara plus I'm a big fan of other Haus Labs products, so I thought I would try it out. It started flaking on me almost instantly. It didn't make my lashes look longer nor did it add volume. I may give it 1 more try, but I think I'm going to have to return this.",31 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,ashrenee7987,I was a pat McGrath die hard this formula changed the rules of the game for me. I don’t think I could ever use another formula ever again. It’s beyond amazing.,30 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,lisaDee79,Racoon eyes alert! Looks nice for first 5 minutes.,30 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,,"If you have fine eyelashes that won’t hold a curl, I wouldn’t recommend. Even though this isn’t a wet formula, it really weighed down my lashes after just one coat.",30 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
"Gives beautiful, natural length",cheysiouxbeauty,Definitely gives length but in a natural way. Doesn't make my eye lashes look like spider legs. It didn't smudge on me. If I didn't already have long lashes I would buy the full size version ( I used my points to get sample size).,30 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Nope,catlopez71,"Nice brush but it gave me Raccoon eyes. Just smudges under eye, even if I just put on top it still ended up on under my eyes.",30 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Awesome but not perfect!,Shaynamash,I love Haus Labs and think their products are spectacular. I was so excited to try this mascara. I really love how beautiful and easy this mascara is. It gives a natural non clumpy look that I personally love. However the mascara tends to smear. I have greasy eyelids and if I don’t powder up then it smears and flakes off. I also wish it was waterproof cause i like my mascara to survive tears.,29 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,AfafB,"Nice definition, doesn’t flake. Good volume and length without clumping. Only took a star off bc I feel it’s over hyped, it’s a great mascara but not much different. Now haus lip glosses, those are amazing n",29 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,paytonw97,I have never left a review but I was heavily influenced to get this and I wish it was a winner but it gives me the WORST raccoon eyes and flakes after only a couple of hours :( I’m still a haus labs stan though I will continue to purchase other produc,29 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Do not even try it if you have straight lashes,Breeya,My lashes were weighed down within 10 minutes of applying and it smudged all over my eyes as the day went on. Packaging is very cheap feeling and it’s honestly just a really poor quality product. Love haus labs but this is not it,29 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Too much Flaking,Kelliaultman,Do not buy this if you are planning on wearing this for more than 2-3 hours. It flakes everywhere. Save your money.,28 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
pass.,jackiehope,Looks great right after you apply it... and then it's all downhill from there. Major flaking and raccoon eyes after only 2-3 hours.,27 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Not a winner,dorsalfin20,Smudging was not ideal. Clumps bad too. I  really liked that it was contact friendly and it felt really good all night but sadly going back.,27 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Smudged really bad,osjhtafri,"I was so excited to try this because I love mascaras that don’t add a lot of drama to your lashes. But after only an hour this smudged really bad on me without me touching my eyes or anything. Maybe it’s just me, but I wouldn’t recommend",27 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
It made my lashes look great but….,unityduke,I really wanted to love this and I had high expectations but unfortunately it flaked throughout the day and transferred onto my eyelids near my eyebrow.,27 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
"It burns when washing it off, SO GOOD THOUGH",atarnarider,"when i first started using it for some reason it didnt really work but then i got the hang of the flat and curved side, i will say that when i wash my face this is the only mascara that literally burns my eyes!!! It is such a pretty mascara and I will probably end up sucking it up and using it because its that great though.",27 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
A must have,Mirazouri,I could say amazing but similar to Maybelline lash sensational. What i loved about it it does not clump or smudge and you can build it easily and it is so light on the eyes.,27 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,sg8668,"If you’re looking for a soft mascara look then this product is for you, if you like your lashes to be bold then this is not for you. I had to apply 4 layers to really get my lashes how I like. There’s definitely more affordable drug stores brands that do better.",26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Flakes Like No Other,audracofo,"Everything I’ve tried from Haus Labs has been stellar, until this mascara. Influencers have consistently been raving about it, so I thought I would give it a shot even though I happen to love my usual mascara. I’ve never had a mascara flake off like this one. Within an hour, my under eye was covered in mascara flakes. Returning.",26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Its okay,hockeydiva,It's not bad but I wont be repurchasing. Easy to get off at the end of the day. Creates some volume but not any better than a drug store. Iila is still the best for me.,26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Best mascara ever!,Virgibella,This is the best mascara I ever had. I love that really gives my natural lashes full volume and length. I also love is vegan and do not irritate my eyes. And when removing it’s not a problem at all. But!,26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
It’s decent!,Serenabobeana,"I have thick very straight lashes and this definitely helps to lift and curl them a bit. Wears well, no problems with flaking!  Overall, I am happy with my purchase.",26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
YESSSSS YOU NEED IT,JustMeTimO,so good omg you need this because it comes off easy and it makes your lashes look so good and separated after. you need this because it’s not bad for your lashes after i took it off it made my lashes feel soft and tea,26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Don’t bother,Seminole,"Gives a great fanned out look, however, it leaves dots on the top of my eyelids after hour 2. Sigh. It’s not like it’s hot right now, either. I can only imagine how horrible it would be in the summer. Raccoon eyes for sure.",26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Not for straight lashes,janeth98,"As someone with naturally straight lashes, this product doesn’t work :( unfortunately, i have to return it. My lashes didn’t hold the curl.",26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Actually lengthens and volumizes,StephanieAnn13,"I’ve become a really big fan of this mascara. I’m usually hesitant when a mascara claims that it’s both lengthening and volumizing, because usually it’s one or the other, but I was pleasantly surprised to experience that this one actually does both. It’s a rich black pigmented mascara and I didn’t have any issues with flaking or smudging. I would definitely pick this one up again.",26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Majorly let down,,"I saw great reviews on TikTok for this new mascara. I loved Haus Labs liquid liner so I figured this was a no brainer. Loved how smooth the formula was and the shape of the brush. However, after only 2 hours of wear, I had MAJOR raccoon eyes. And I had prepped with MILK Hydro Grip primer and Lancôme setting spray. Definitely do not recommend this product. Currently processing a return.",26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
New go-to for both everyday and glam looks!!,kmsterchi,What I like most about this mascara is I can go for a lovely more natural look with one coat or do a glam look with two or three coats without clumping. It’s biggest strength is keeping the lashes separated while still adding a lot of volume and lengthening,26 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Truly just okay,MakeupJunkie991,"I’m a big time believer in drug store mascara, but I love haus labs so I figured I’d give it a try. The mascara is pretty nice and super black. Seperates the lashes nicely but, nothing special. After several hours I had pretty bad raccoon eyes. So I would  recommend, if you’re not using for all day where.",25 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
(almost) amazing!!,dridri25,"the product itself is INCREDIBLE. ive been looking for a good mascara and so glad i found one that doesnt flake BUT the wand.. it made my lashes clump up so bad. so as long as you have a good wand to apply it with, i’d say buy it!",25 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Incredible mascara,mirandajulin,"I LOVE this mascara! I’d heard mixed things so I didn’t have really high hopes, but it’s worked great for me! My lashes look so long and beautiful, never clumpy and they don’t fall. I also have very oily eyelids so I usually wear waterproof mascaras, but this one doesn’t smudge on me or give me raccoon eyes by some miracle.",25 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
OK but not a fave. Smudges but doesn’t irritate.,AveryAria,Dry-ish formula that builds decent volume and length but doesn’t hold a curl that well and smudges under my eyes. The smudging isn’t as bad as some but it’s definitely noticeable. The best thing about this mascara is that it doesn’t irritate my eyes or make them burn. Like not even a little. But I like  the performance of the Tower-28 one better because it doesn’t smudge as much so I’m going back to that.,25 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
High hopes heavy disappointment,lovelylisad,As much as I adore the whole concept of this mascara and that it’s vegan… I tried it today and noticed its formula is dry. I didn’t see any extra thickness or volume but noticed smudging immediately on my upper and lower eyelids. There is barely any product on the wand and some of it clumps immediately. I put on a second coat and it looks thick. For over $40 I wanted something of a miracle but I can get amazing results from revlon or benefit. Amazing intentions and awesome attempt for haus labs but this isn’t worth the price tag. It will be returned,25 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Lashes couldn’t stay up,sunnkenrat,"Was really hoping it would work.. unfortunately it did not. After applying this, my lashes couldn’t stay up.",24 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
great new mascara,medicalmeyhem,"I really enjoy this mascara. One coat gives length, 2-3 coats if you want more dramatic volume. I love that it also curls my lashes as well. I haven't had any issues with smudging or flaking. A good buy if you like a fluttery fanned out look.",24 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
It’s a pass,MOMMUSICMASCARA,Lots of volume and length…but also gave me serious raccoon eyes.,24 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Serious case of raccoon eyes,NovaBGM,"She does everything she said she does-hence the 3* rating. But I’ve never had a mascara give me raccoon eyes like this. Sadly, I had for return.",24 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,Indigoxfera,I was disappointed with the mascara because it doesn’t take much for mascaras to give me length and volume but for some reason it wasn’t the case with this mascara and I’m so sad about it.,23 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Not what I expected :(,torinapoli,Did not work out good on my lashes. It weighted them down instead of lifting them. After about 2-3 hours I had major fall out! Just wasn’t for me!,23 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Nice!,moona78,"While applying the product, there were no clumps, my lashes did not stick together, and it had a light application, so you may have to do more than one coat, but is perfect if going for a natural look. After a few hours, there was minimal fall out under the eyes. The only thing i dislike about the product were these weird long hair-like strings in the tube and they would get stuck to the wand.",23 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Didn’t love,tmoney01,I wished it was a darker black. It also ran under my eye as the day went on. I wanted to love this.,23 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Don’t waste your money.,JingleBelle14,"Meh. Didn’t lengthen. Didn’t volumize. Flaky, clumpy, smudged. Not great - merely adequate.",23 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,lyndsmb,best mascara i’ve tried in a long time! i get compliments on my lashes every time i use this,23 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Favorite mascara ever-It’s the only make up I need,nataliazerimar,THIS IS LITERALLY the best mascara ever. After decades of using Dior Show this is the only one I ever want to use. I’m scared of running out of it! It makes me lashes so long and separated perfectly.,23 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Disappointing!,Dimples1218,"I really had high hopes for this, but it’s just not a good product. I love Haus Labs products, but this one in particular is really disappointing. It clumps a lot, and doesn’t really coat the lashes very well. I’ll stick to Lancôme for now!",23 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
It’s only okay,Blee1989,"Its only okay, I like other options better and at this price I won’t repurchase",22 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Disappointed,joyzee0925,"I had such high hopes but after two weeks of use I truly don’t like it. The brush is awful. My lashes end up a clumpy mess and I end up having to use a different brush to clean it up. I love the concealer and foundation but hate the mascara
not liking the mascara",22 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Sorry Haus Labs love you,AvocadoToad,"I wanted to love this…but it smudges 😔 I love Haus Labs and this mascara definitely lengthens, but it smudged way too easily",22 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Don’t do it girl,hairobsessed,"I saw this mascara being hyped up on social media from an influencer who I trust, and unfortunately the circle of trust is now broken. This mascara goes on fine, but easily replicated by any basic mascara. Today is my first day wearing it and it’s only lunchtime and I have raccoons eyes. Flay and smudged. Going back to my beloved Tatre. Today is my first day wa",21 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
LOVE,Emmymadison,"I’m a harash critic when it comes to mascaras and I’ve tried them all. This is by far the best one I’ve tried in Sephora. It kept the curl of my lash, lifted, didn’t flake all day and made my eyes pop. 10/10. I really want it in brown so please make that next!!",21 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Hard pass,SaraVictoria7,Unfortunately this is super mid- the charlotte tilbury tilbury mascara is way better.  Not worth it because it smudges and flakes OD,21 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
don’t believe the hype,ramcmullin,"i usually love haus labs products, but this is quite possibly the worst mascara i’ve ever tried. i tried applying multiple coats and i still wasn’t impressed. after just 2 hours of wear i had flakes and smudging. don’t fall for the social media hype. there are way better mascaras for less money. i will be returning this :/",21 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
don’t believe reviews on social media,,So heavy and so clumpy i was really hoping to like this since i’ve loved every other haus labs product but this unfortunately is such a miss,21 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Save your money.,d2enterprizes,I never write a review. Never. But this mascara is so bad I had to. Don’t waste your money. So many better mascaras on the market than this expensive one.,21 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Awesome,chrissy102490,So glad I didn’t listen to the reviews this gives me great wispy yet voluminous lashes!,21 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Too clumpy,coleybangs,I was disappointed by this mascara. It’s so thick and clumpy that the bristles don’t separate the lashes. It barely spreads so it creates uneven distribution.  I had to go over it with a separate brush to clean up the product.,21 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,carlsxo6,I’ve been using this almost every day layers so well on my lashes and very build able. You definitely feel in control when putting on this mascara i absolutely love it. I also have straight flat eyelashes and it kept the curled pretty well,21 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,,"If you enjoy mad raccoon eyes by 1:00 pm then go for it, this mascara was so runny and clumpy can’t believe it’s so hyped. Don’t recommend.",20 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

Worth it!!,AMPadilla,"Just wow!!! Literally two coats is all it took!! 
Only downside is, it does flake.",20 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Do NOT buy,kbabyr,Don’t believe these influencers who say this is good! It’s so dry it’s horrible! What a waste of money! Shame on haus labs for this mess,20 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Clumpy and crumbly,foxylochs,This did everything it claimed it wouldn’t. Also dries very quickly so the second coat goes on and just sticks lashes together. Clumpy and crumbly. Left  black crumbs under eyes after only a few hours.,20 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
"Good, but lashes don’t stay fully curled",Sammoooo,I have straight lashes and bought this because of the reviews saying it was a substitute for waterproof in the way of keeping lashes curled. It definitely works better than other mascaras I’ve tried but not the holy grail I was hoping it would be. Good enough for daily wear but when I really want curled lashes I’ll stick to my waterproof,20 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
It’s a no,Ebbystarr,"Even tho this gave great results , it also flacked horribly. I will have to use another over it that’s water proof. I don’t mind layering , but sometimes I don’t have the time.",20 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Amazing volume and length,kristinafh,"I’m surprised by all of the negative reviews! I purchased this the day of release - my own money - not gifted. I love how much volume and length that it gives. I’ve tried hundreds of mascaras over the past two decades and have never had a mascara that made such a visible difference. 

Side note: I have very dry eyes and I have to use eye drops every few hours. As a precautionary measure for every mascara I use, I apply a tubing mascaras on top of regular mascara and that seems to ensure no panda eyes and no flaking. When I use tubing mascara on top of Haus labs, I don’t lose any volume or length!",20 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,tryingharder25,"This goes on well at first. However, after I had it just a few days I noticed the formula was drying in the tube. After only a few hours, I had black on the bottoms of my eyes (picture if you fell asleep with it on)-except I didn't. It flakes very badly also. Not worth the $30. To add insult to injury, I tried to return it a Sephora in Kohls (closest to me), and was told they don't accept returns unless it was purchased on the Kohl's website...even though its a SEPHORA",20 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
not a fan,rainydays1221,wanted to love this but i clumped my lashes so bad and it took a while to get off. don’t let tiktok influence you. i usually use the ilia mascaras since it has a lightweight formula and comes off in one swipe just with water,20 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,far97,"I have straight Asian lashes that usually don’t hold a curl, no matter what mascara I use. But this Haus Labs mascara actually made my lashes look fuller and longer, which I love. It also keeps them separated without clumping, and the brush wand is great. I haven’t had any issues with flaking, fallout, or irritation. After a few hours, my lashes do start to droop a bit, but that’s probably just how my lashes are. Overall, though, this mascara is working really well for me.",19 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

Amazing for daily use,danielasz,"I have been testing this product for several days and I can say that it is very good for daily use, the texture is dry so it is easy to apply, it lengthens the eyelashes a lot and keeps them separated, the packaging is beautiful, the brush is a a little bigger than average and it's really easy to remove which I really appreciate because it's gentle on my eyelashes.",19 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,HannahSimoney,I wanted to love this SO BADLY but the raccoon eyes were such a dealbreaker. Absolutely loved the way it applied i.e. length and volume BUT within 2 hours I had raccoon eyes. Had to return after a week :(,19 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Disappointed,SoapyMel,"Well….this was quite a let down.  I love Haus Labs complexion and lip gloss products so much, so I was really excited about this mascara launch.  After several uses I will be returning it.  

It’s definitely a dry formula, which I can appreciate with some mascaras.  But the wand is not great for me.  Because of its shape, I can’t get my inner corner or outer corner lashes combed through the way I can with most other mascaras.  I’m learning that a curved wand suits me best.  This wand places too much product on my inner and outer corner lashes and doesn’t comb it through well, so I end up with clumped lashes on the outer corners and had to use a lash comb to comb through and remove the clumpiness.

I’m a mascara fanatic and usually try every new mascara release.  Nothing beats Benefit Fan Fest for me right now.  I prefer fanned out, separated, lengthening mascaras over volumizing mascaras.  You might like this mascara if you prefer volume over length and separation.  But I also found that even though this formula is drier “lighter” feeling, somehow it made my lashes droop a bit, within 30 minutes of application.  I tried just one coat, and it still did it.

Just overall, this wasn’t for me…..sadly.",18 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
must have,jessicanunes,"best mascara!  The formula separates lashes well, so if you're going for a more natural look, it's easy to build up without overdoing it. For a bolder look, you can layer it to achieve more volume, but with a gentle hand, it definitely offers a refined, natural finish.",18 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
I’m torn,Hailes16,"I, like many others, am an avid mascara fan — always on the look out for the best of the best! I bought into the social media hype and ordered. I like to give mascara a few weeks fair chance, as I find most to be super “wet” on first wear. I’m torn because I do love that ingredients are included to help with overall lash health, but gosh by the time I get home from work, it has flaked onto my cheeks, and I don’t find it that it does anything particularly special to my lashes. Especially when compared to much cheaper alternatives at the drug store that do more.",18 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
"The hype is NOT real. Love, a mascara junkie.",rachie00,"You’d be better served by a drug store brand. This stuff is awful - dry dry dry, and not in a good way… doesn’t adhere to the whole lash, making them look *shorter* than usual. Clumpy, flaky. The one thing it didnt do was smudge under my eyes.

Gaga for Gaga😍,kenzielou811,"This mascara knocked my socks off! I am the first to say drugstore mascara is just as good, if not better, but there’s something about the formula that truly does add length (not in a crunchy clumpy way, more in a natural serums way)",18 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
so bad 😖,endny,"Don’t let tiktok influencers fool you, this mascara is not good at all. It didn’t add much length and the results after applying looked like a bad drugstore mascara.

Must have!!,woahfleur,"As someone with very short and straight lashes it’s impossible to find a good mascara that lengthens but actually holds the lashes. This mascara is amazing!

Not friendly for straight lashes,km124,I was so excited to try but was disappointed. I have straight lashes that I curl and as soon as I put this product on the lashes went flat. Super common for me and rare that I find a good mascara but I was hopeful.,17 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,cocoakacokes,"Literally this mascara blew my mind in three seconds! I got the mini with 100 point reward and my lashes which are usually fine and short (in my opinion lol I’ve been trying to use Latisse, but I still think they’re too short) were beautiful in seconds! I don’t wear a lot of makeup, especially at work so it’s nice to have just a little pop that I can build up if I want. I had to immediately go and write a review! Immediately purchasing!! Everything Haus labs is literally ICONIC. Lady G, you are my SHERO and all your products are my holy grails!!!.

Goes on pretty then smudges terribly!,Blondeinabmw,"I love how this mascara applies and the formula makes my lashes look really pretty with just one coat.

I don’t get it,ctomtom22,I’m convinced anyone hyping this up is on Gaga’s payroll because this was abysmal. It smudges and my eyelashes flaked like a croissant. The separation was nice but there’s no point if it’s going to give a panda eye effect.,16 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Extremely over hyped!,Angelinahiccup,So disappointed with this. Was influenced as always after seeing a TikTok. Aside from the fact it gives major raccoon eyes / smudges badly. It also gave me an allergic reaction. My eyes were so sore and swollen after using it. Save your money,16 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

My lashes have volume now!,Sashhhh,"I don’t currently have a mascara that is a repeat buy in my makeup routine and have been wanting to find one. The B structural volumizing  + lengthening mascara might just be IT. I loveee how soft the applicator is. Most are rough/stiff and clumps the product up.

Not really understanding the hype…,bpann13,"Because of all the hype and my love for the House Labs foundation, I purchased this product.  The first time I used it, I couldn’t understand what the hype was.  I’ve given it about two weeks now and I’m  still not thrilled with it. I find it to be a little clumpy and flaky.

Not it!!,AlyshaRice,Super dry and flakey - definitely not long lasting! I do really love this mascara brush but the formula is NOT it! I literally thought it was completely dried out from the moment I opened it. Just a flop besides the brush!,16 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
So Close!,prettykitteh,"I really wanted to love this mascara— I like that the formula goes on super soft and doesn’t leave my lashes crunchy. It does give me volume and length, especially with the unique brush shape! You can see the difference in the picture I’ve attached; left side is before and right is after mascara. It’s great for adding a little drama, and managed to do it without any clumping, which feels really unique among mascaras! This one keeps my lashes smooth and separated, unlike a lot of others!

My only issue? My Asian lashes tend to be stick straight, and this mascara didn’t keep them curled throughout the day. That means I got little smudges under my eye as my lashes brushed against my lower lid. It’s an issue I get with every mascara, but one I’m looking to avoid— so my search continues. I think this would be perfect for someone with different lashes. I’ll probably end up gifting this to a friend!",15 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
You are magnificent,1madfan,"After weeks of using this, I have to say how amazed I am at the condition of my lashes.

This is a good mascara, but is a drier formula so requires some patience to build up and avoid clumping. I also have oilier under-eyes and found that this smudged after a full day of wear.

Nothing to write home about.,MollyBee15,"Not sure how this mascara has such great reviews. It’s certainly getting hyped online but I don’t see it. I’ve tried pretty much every mascara at Sephora and this one is “meh”. The first thing I noticed is how not-luxe the packaging is. The silver looks pretty but is super lightweight and cheap feeling. As expensive as this mascara is, I expected MUCH more. It’s NOTHING like the actual metal one of Milk Makeup. 

It’s a “dry” mascara. It wasn’t clumpy which was appreciated, and separates lashes well. But I didn’t get the volume or length it claims. It wasn’t crumbly. It did keep my lashes curled all day, but the vavoom just wasn’t there. 

I’ll keep this as an “every day” mascara. It kind of reminds me of Clinique’s. This is not my nighttime or going out mascara.",11 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

Haus labs alwaysssss out does themselves. First the packaging. Sleek, classy and beautiful. The wand is thick. Which I love!! I absolutely love how thick and long it is BUT there is not a lot of product that comes out. Just the perfect amount. It is a light formula that leaves little to zero clumping. This mascara is the ONLY one that I gave tried that actually claims no clumping and MEANS IT!! and the curl in my lash LASTED! Mind blown. 10/10 RECOMMENDED! I love you haus lab.

Love,Lizzieloppez4,"** Haus kindly gave me this Mascara for free so that I could review it. **

The only reason why I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because I have pins straight lashes and most of the time the only way they will stay up the whole entire day is if it's waterproof. This mascara would've been perfect if it was a waterproof mascara. It does provide the lengthening effect that it says it will. I also do believe that because I have naturally long lashes. I see it that way. I don't necessarily think it adds a huge difference, but it is very easy to use. I love the applicator and my eyes didn't feel irritated.

So so good a mascara!,,"OMG, this mascara is an absolute game-changer! I’m officially obsessed and can’t imagine going back to anything else. It solves one of my biggest struggles, no more smudging or transferring to the under-eye area, which has always been an issue for me. With just a few strokes, my lashes look fuller, longer, and beautifully defined. The formula is lightweight yet super effective, giving my lashes that perfect lift and volume without clumping. If you’re looking for a mascara that truly delivers on all fronts, this is the one! Trust me, it’s worth the hype!",6 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

My new favorite everyday mascara,laurenelissa,This mascara and wand reminds me of a more natural version of a Korean mascara I used to love that had the same unique brush. Gave me more length than volume but think it’s a great option for a more natural everyday look! And pretty great wear - I wore this for 8 hours with no flaking and super minimal smudging on the lower lash.,6 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

"Dry mascara. It’s good, but not THAT good",Aj321,"I love majority of Haus Labs and expected this would be no different. I have naturally long lashes and like them separated but prefer the chunky look. This mascara is VERY dry, and takes a while to build up your lashes. When my mascara reaches this level of dry I typically throw it out. The pros are it doesn’t transfer or give you raccoon eyes. It’s also easy to get off.",5 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,DrastiP,"This mascara delivers as it says. The formula perfectly balances volume and length, creating bold, dramatic lashes without clumping.

Don’t Fall For It,BeautyWithin180,Its an okay mascara the best thing about it is the brush but this formula is to dry for my liking and takes a while to build up to where I like them which is dramatic. I feel all the good reviews are from paid influencers. You can find better.,5 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
A makeup MUSTHAVE,lovelesss,I have long straight lashes so it’s hard to find a mascara that holds them up but also gives them a curl. This mascara absolutely did both! I love it,4 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

,karinep13,I’ve tried SO many mascaras and was literally shocked at how long my lashes looked after using this mascara. It looks so good and is super easy to use + take off after with cleansing oil.

My new go-to mascara!,Andreaglass44,I was in need of a new clean mascara and I am so happy that I tried Haus Labs’ B Structural Volumizing and Lengthening Mascara. The applicator is great at reaching all the lashes with its unique shape. The before and after speaks for itself but it provided great volume for my light colored lashes and took my makeup to the next level. Another thing I enjoy is how easy it is to build up and also remove. This is my new go-to. Highly recommend!,4 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

My new HG mascara!,Ktrtek,"This is actually one of the best mascaras I've ever used. I am someone who is extremely particular about my mascara and wand, and it's extremely difficult to find the right combo. I'm guilty of applying mascara with one wand and brushing it through with another to get it just right. This mascara and wand are exactly what I have been looking for. My lashes are extremely thin and translucent, so they can't handle a lot of weight before they start looking clumpy and heavy. One coat of this was perfect. The length, color, and even the nice liner effect it gives is great! Sounds dramatic, but I'm obsessed.",4 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Must Purchase!,bergie72,"Honestly the best mascara I’ve ever used.  Performed from first use - unheard of!  I’m 52 with little lashes.  This doesn’t transfer on older lids.  My lashes have never looked better and I’ve used everything.  Love it, 10 stars!",4 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
"Beautiful Results, But Curl Doesn’t Stay",Eldiabloesguapo,"Love how this mascara applies! The pigment and lash definition are stunning. Sadly, it doesn’t hold my curl, even with layering and quick-drying. If curl isn’t an issue for you, you’ll adore it!",4 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
My new daily mascara,alyssamarie9,It was extremely good at volume without clumping in the first pass.

The length it gave was absolutely wonderful!,4 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Perfect addiction to my no makeup days as well!,zahracam,"This was my first time trying this mascara and it was actually the best one I’ve tried, the applicator is smooth and applies so easily without clumping, makes lashes longer and gives it full volume.",3 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Not Holding the Curl Well,Katetran,"I received this mascara for free in exchange for my honest review. The Haus Labs B Structural Mascara excels in lengthening and adds some volume, but it didn’t work well for my naturally straight lashes. It didn’t hold a curl and left my lashes looking clumpy after application. If you’re looking for a mascara that focuses on length, this could be a good fit, but it may not be ideal for curl or lash separation",3 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
A must have!,dinag91,"Wow! This mascara is absolute perfection. I’ve never loved a mascara like this! Let’s start with packaging, absolutely beautiful. I love the H on top.

I struggle with mascaras smudging all the time! So many, high end brands, but not this one! I will be purchasing ongoing!",3 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
A must have !,skash851,"The photos speak for themselves when I say this mascara is amazing. I love the length and volume it gives with little effort. I struggle a lot with the wands, this one is sturdy and applies easily. The mascara is so easy to love I would call myself a mascara snob, this is easily my new favorite one!

My new holy grail,amejias,"With my hooded eyes mascaras tend not to be my friends. I say this because I always manage to get mascara all over my lids. That was not the case with the B Structural Volumizing + Lengthening Mascara. Because of the dual sided wand, I am able to apply the mascara perfectly without getting it all over my lids. The other side gives it such nice volume to my lashes. I really enjoyed that the formula is not overly wet. I applied two coats and it did not clump at all. Loved the way my lashes looked.",2 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

Smudge-Free and Buildable: Why I’m Loving Haus Lab,manderson,"I’ve been loving the Haus Labs Structural Volumizing and Lengthening Mascara! The dual-sided brush is really unique—the flat side deposits pigment, and the hourglass side fans out lashes. While I’m still figuring out the best way to use it, the brush works well overall and gives great results.

The formula is a standout for me—it’s dry, which I prefer since wet mascaras tend to smear everywhere and get on my eyelids (thanks to my hooded eyes). This one doesn’t do that, and it’s easy to remove at the end of the day.

For transparency, I was gifted this product by the company, but I genuinely really like it and will keep using it. If you prefer a drier formula that’s buildable and smudge-free, this is worth checking out!",2 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Amazing!,Nora099,A beautiful mascara that both lengths and volumizes my lashes. It doesn’t smudge nor does it flake throughout the day. My lashes are feathered out and beautiful without any clumping. Love the rich blackness of the mascara too. An overall wonderful mascara that made my lashes look amazing!,2 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Replaced my long time favorite,Yardene,"This mascara has become a staple in my daily glam and every time I use it I fall more in love with it. I naturally have long lashes and use mascara to lift and color my lashes and this does that and more! It can go from light glam to looking like I’m wearing false lashes. I was lucky enough to get this product sent to me by haus labs themselves but I definitely will be repurchasing this product as soon as I run out! If you are looking for a mascara that lengthens, volumizes and heals ur lashes look no further!",2 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
A must have!,mariahh1,"This mascara has proven to be exceptionally effective in enhancing the length and volume of my lashes.

,apeachyday,"This mascara has pros and cons. My lashes are naturally dark and long. What I mainly look for in a mascara is some extra volume. The finish of this mascara is very natural, and I had zero clumping. I was surprised at how long it made my lashes and it gave a bit of a curl as well. It didn't add noticeable volume for me.",1 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Must have!!!!!,madisyn95,"It’s sooooo good
Finally a mascara I will always reach for",1 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
LOVE this a lot - but it did take A LOT,Krissyawaters,"The most notable thing about this mascara is that it does a great job of separating the lashes and not clumping. The design of the wand makes it really easy to apply and see the lengthening of your lashes in action. I think that it looks great, and it helps to maintain a natural look rather than spider-webby-looking lashes. However, my only complaint is that it seemed to take quite a lot of product to get the effect I was after. However, I do love the final outcome. It didn't smudge all day, and I love that this is a clean mascara. I also like that it was easy to remove.",31 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
So good!!,Lily721,"This is extremely very good. I have long, heavy, stick straight lashes and this formula coats every last one while putting up a good fight to keep them looking lifted! Gaga, if you’re reading this would you PLZ also release it in brown?",31 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

Buy it NOW!!!!,asolor01,"I absolutely LOVE this mascara. I’m usually the type of girl that reaches for a good drugstore mascara instead of a high end mascara, BUT after trying this one, it would take the win in my book! I thoroughly enjoy the lightweight feel of this product on my lashes",31 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
This is not it,mandyM17,"This was not it. I don’t get the reviews, they must have been gifted for free…..it took many swipes to get any results and it was still not anything worth buying. I tried the tarte tubing and it’s so much better",31 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,MishMishShell,"This mascara checks all the boxes for me! The dual-sided brush design is genius—one flat side makes it super easy to coat every lash in rich, jet-black pigment, while the hourglass side gives that dramatic volume and length we all crave. It’s incredibly buildable, so you can go from natural to bold without clumping.

What impressed me most is the wear: no flaking, no smudging, and it still looks flawless after hours. But when it’s time to remove it, it comes off effortlessly—no tugging required. It’s perfect for anyone who wants bold, long lashes that last all day without any hassle. Highly recommend for all  mascara lovers!

New favourite!,Elycouras,"Wow! I’ve been looking for something to replace my Dior show and my Ilia mascara and this is the one! It is so good at aluminizing and separating the Lashes.

,theluxeexplorer,Looks amazing on first application. It gives a soft and wispy look. You can easily build up to create a bolder and longer look.

,Jacir,"The B Structural Volumizing + Lengthening Mascara by Haus Labs is a standout product in the crowded world of mascaras. From the first application, it’s clear this formula is designed to deliver on both volume and length without compromising on wearability. The mascara glides on smoothly, evenly coating each lash from root to tip without clumping.  

What impressed me most is the precision of the wand. It’s designed to reach even the tiniest lashes, allowing for a defined, fanned-out look that enhances the eyes beautifully. The formula itself strikes a balance between being lightweight yet buildable. One coat provides a natural, everyday look, while additional layers amp up the drama without flaking or smudging throughout the day.  

The staying power of this mascara is remarkable. It holds up through long days without losing curl or intensity, yet it’s easy to remove with a gentle cleanser at the end of the day. Another plus is its clean, vegan formula, which makes it a great option for those with sensitive eyes or a preference for ethical beauty products.  

Overall, the B Structural Volumizing + Lengthening Mascara delivers on its promises and then some. It’s a versatile product that works for both subtle and bold looks, and it’s quickly become a staple in my makeup routine.",30 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

"Non clumpy, very dark mascara",klarez,"I’m always hesitant to buy higher end brands mascara because I feel for my short lashes they all work the same, best under falsies. This mascara is a game changer, it made me confident not wearing false lashes with a full glam look. The brush did a great job at separating my lashes and coating every last without becoming clumpy.

Perfect Everyday Mascara!,,"I received this mascara for a review and was impressed with how high quality it is! I typically like to wear lighter more natural looks but occasionally will do full glam and look for mascaras that can both apply light coats and build for a fuller look. This mascara is super buildable without clumping and I loved the dual side brush that allowed to evenly coat the lash then plump them out. I have pretty short and thin lashes and saw a noticeable improvement on both length and volume. Would recommend!

This mascara makes them so long and almost look like they’re curled without having done so. My mom even immediately commented “wow! Your eyelashes are so big!” And she normally doesn’t comment on my makeup. I also love the shape of the wand and that it has technology that helps prevent lash fallout which is so important. I would so so recommend this.",28 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
No muss fuss or flaking,crystalcrafts,"Thank you haus labs for the gift to review. With that said the first day I put the mascara on I noticed how light it felt. It only needed one coat and dried within seconds. There was no flaking, clumping or smudging. (This next part I don’t recommend ) I went to bed wearing it and did not wake up looking like a raccoon, I applied another coat and it still felt very light weight on my lashes. The issue of volume id say it did appear that my lashes looked fuller but I highly recommend this and with all of this said, I think the price is reasonable for the things it doesn’t do rather than what it does do. First is before second is after",28 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

Gorgeous lashes fast,ffxgirl1,"This mascara is both super effective and cruelty free.  I love that I can count on that for haus labs products.   The formula is vegan and goes on effortlessly.   I have found my lashes getting a little less prominent looking over time and need mascaras to make my lashes stand out. This product helps to make them look longer in one swipe. With two swipes they look more voluminous and full.  The black color makes my eyes stand out.  I especially appreciate that the applicator doesn’t make my lashes clump or look like spider legs.  Rather, my lashes look gorgeous and bold.  This product was complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion.",26 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Not comparable to waterproof mascara,cleliza,"Was excited to try this and went to buy it on release day, despite usually having to use waterproof mascaras to keep anyyy sort of curl in my straight stubborn lashes. Unfortunately, this performed similarly to other mascaras in that it weighed down my lashes so didn’t hold a curl much and got clumpy pretty quickly when trying to build it up. It isn’t as bad as some mascaras - the new Charlotte Tilbury mascara was horrible for curl on me- but doesn’t perform like my waterproof ones. The claim that it is nourishing for your eyelashes is really cool though, and may be the thing that keeps me from returning.",26 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
My lashes looks longer,aqsu,"As someone with flat, stubborn lashes, the Haus Labs mascara has been a dream for me! It lifts and curls my lashes effortlessly, with results that last all day.

The wand makes it easy to coat every lash evenly for a bold, eye-opening look. If you’re looking for a reliable mascara that delivers on its promises, this one’s worth every penny!",26 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Great for everyday use!,JaiJos,"I love the curved shape of the wand. It makes it so easy to coat both the inner and outer corners of my lashes, exactly what I aim for. The dark pigmentation is amazing. It really helps to define my lashes and adds length. I can apply about three coats before my lashes start to look clumpy or stick together. I have short, straight lashes that don't hold a curl well, and unfortunately, this mascara doesn't help with that either, but honestly, I've made peace with my lashes, so it's not a dealbreaker for me. What I really liked was how long it lasts without flaking, and it's super easy to remove with cleansing oil. The sleek, slim tube is nice. It takes up less space in my makeup bag. I like this mascara, I've been using it daily.",26 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,F2theali,"The Haus Labs B Structural Volumizing + Lengthening Mascara delivers an impressive mix of volume, length, and lift.

What stands out is its lightweight feel and long-lasting wear—it resists smudging and flaking throughout the day, even in humid conditions. The formula is also vegan and cruelty-free, aligning with Haus Labs' commitment to clean beauty. 

While the results are stunning, those with sensitive eyes might need to patch-test, as reactions can vary. Overall, it’s a solid choice for anyone seeking high-impact lashes with a clean formula.",26 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

,MrsAudreyNelson,"Let me start off by saying I have really sparse, straight and short lashes - without mascara I look like a sad little elephant. 

B Structural is an awesome everyday product - it gives full coverage in just one swipe, it's lightweight, feathery, it does not clump. My lashes immediately look lifted (not quite curled), full and beautifully fanned out.

I've only used it a few times but so far there's been no flaking or eye irritation.

Definitely volumizing!,TOMIEKAWAKAMI,"Gifted by HAUS LABS.

First of all it’s definitely volumizing, it didn’t smudge or flake on me! The wand design catches those little lashes on the inner and outer corner easily; but as you layer the second or third time, it can get a little clumpy, first layer is beautiful enough, I shouldn’t be so greedy. 
However it doesn’t hold the curl on me, but to be fair, I have very stubborn downturned straight Asian lashes, I got the same problem with most western brands mascara, I’m sure it’s fine on naturally curled lashes.",26 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

Insanely beautiful,montyb88,"This was gifted by Haus Labs in exchange for my honest review. I’m absolutely loving this mascara. The wand has two different sets of bristles. The first side really helps to lift, separate, and lengthen. While the other side coats the lashes, and gives a ton of volume. It’s super black, and holds curl really well for not being waterproof. It will also help to treat and condition, to keep your lashes long, strong, and healthy. I have really sensitive eyes, and a lot of mascaras make my eyes itchy or watery. This hasn’t irritated them or caused any sensitivity whatsoever. It looks insanely beautiful, and gives a fanned out effect. One coat is honestly more than enough. But if you do want to build it up, do so before it dries down so it doesn’t clump together. It’s by far the best non waterproof mascara I have ever used, and is worth every penny.",26 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

,Katiedawn123,Two words to sum this mascara up would be HOLY MOLY! It’s legit lash extensions in a tub! It defines my lashes and gives volume. Easily one of the best formulas I’ve used in a long time! Gifted by Haus Labs for an honest review.,23 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Underwhelming and basic,TatumBlvd,I have stick straight lashes and i like mascara with a big curl. The wand didnt do a good job at curling. I had to wiggle the wand a lot to get a good curl. Very disappointed with the results. However it isnt clumpy which is why i’m putting 2 stars instead of one.,23 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

,ivyhindman,"I struggle with extremely stubborn lashes so when I found out that this was going to be a volumizing mascara, I was extremely excited. It definitely gave me the extra volume that my pin straight lashes needed, and I loved how over the formula was it didn’t have any issues with smearing, and the fan out effect was gorgeous as well.",23 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes

The perfect drama mascara for me!,FrannyBee,"I’ve been using this mascara for just 4 days, and it’s an immediate YES from me! Lady Gaga and the Haus Labs team absolutely nailed it again. This formula is super volumizing and lengthening—perfect if you love bold, dramatic lashes.

If you’re more into a natural look, there might be a bit of a learning curve because this mascara delivers drama from the very first swipe (which I personally LOVE). The formula is also a standout: it’s not too wet right out of the tube, which makes it even better in my book.

Although I was lucky enough to receive this mascara to try, I’m 100% planning to repurchase it with my own money. Check out the photos I added so you can see just how incredible it is! Trust me, it’s worth it. 💕”",23 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,DomHarding,This has become one of my all time favorite mascaras! It isn't clumpy and actually gives LENGTH and volume while looking relatively natural. gifted by Haus Labs but all opinions are my own,23 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
One of the best I’ve ever used,haviic,"This mascara is phenomenal. I have a phobia of lash curlers so I need mascara to provide lift and volume on its own. The formula is more dry than most I’ve used but it applies to lashes with ease and without clumping. One coat enhances them perfectly but because I love a bold look, I applied three coats and I was so impressed. With the formula, longevity of wear time as someone with oily lids and the volumizing length all on its own. One of the best I’ve ever used.",23 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
,Kalasmom3,I love this mascara! It’s great if you have decent lash length but they stick out straight. Even curling doesn’t help me. But the Haus Labs mascara lifts my lashes and keeps them up while keeping them soft not crunchy!,23 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Great but expensive,heartsfromrayna,"I received this as a gift for my honest review

The wand has a unique shape to it and I was happy that it didn't clump my lashes together. It applied very smoothly and it left my lashes looking goregous. They're longer and voluminous. I adore it

My issue is that it's $29. For a mascara, that's very expensive. I feel like you can honestly get very similar results with a cheaper mascara. I'm all for splurging on makeup and it's a great products, but I'm a firm believer that mascara is not the thing to splurge on",22 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Impressed,testrite,"This mascara is amazing! It makes my lashes look really long and thick. A biotech-enhanced mascara that delivers 5X fanned-out volume that's nourishing and lengthening, never clumpy or flaky and safe for sensitive eyes. My lashes feel conditioned with continued use. I am really impressed with this mascara and tossed out all of my other mascaras I had. So glad I got to try this to coat my lashes from root to tip to build my desired level. I used two coats only. It was also easy to remove. I was gifted this mascara.",22 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
serious length and volume!,btmezz,"I was actually really surprised at how amazing this mascara turned out. Just one coat gave my lashes length and volume that would normally take 2 or more layers. Also the brush is great and not creating clumps and giving the natural long lash look that’s buildable. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because I have notoriously pin straight lashes that don’t hold a curl without waterproof mascara. That being said, they still held a better curve than most other brands that would just make my lashes fall flat.",21 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
Worth it,gencuesta,From the first swatch I fell in love. The formula of this mascara is just chef’s kiss. I love how easy it is to build multiple coats without my lashes getting too clumpy. I see definite length and volume. No flaking either!,19 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Mascara,Yes
