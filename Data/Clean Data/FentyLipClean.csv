Love love love,CookieAnne,Love this lip oil! Very hydrating and the watermelon scent isn‚Äôt too over powering. I got both the watermelon and the cherry and I actually prefer the watermelon,05 Feb 2025,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,morgansaffelle,This is one of the best lip oils I have used in a long time! It does a phenomenal job of hydrating my lips. üíï,05 Feb 2025,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
The best lip gloss,LizzoRizzo,This is the best lip gloss I have ever had it is a must you need it!,03 Feb 2025,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Fruity Lip Gloss from Early 2000s,JennElise7,"This product reminds me of the fruity lip glosses that you‚Äôd find in Marshall‚Äôs back in the early 2000s but in the best way. It‚Äôs got that ‚Äúartificial‚Äù fruity smell without being nauseatingly artificial. It‚Äôs got that thick, glossy, juicy formula. It is not a thin lip oil at all but that‚Äôs Fenty lippies for you, they are juicy and glossy. It‚Äôs got really sheer pigment, sheer to the point where it looks clear, in my opinion. It‚Äôs definitely moisturizing and lasts hours because of how thick it is. Took one star off just because I‚Äôm not a fan of sticky formulas.",03 Feb 2025,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Good but bad packaging,Lilypad13,"I like the product a lot but Fenty needs to work on packaging. I have several lip products that ""fell apart"" shortly after I got it. The twist off cracked so I have to remove that and a permanently greasy twist off that should be glued to the 1st.",31 Jan 2025,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I need the whole line,,"It applies so smoothly, it smells AMAZING. I need the whole line now .Its my new everyday & night lip oil.Amd its stays on longer that 30 mins like other brands ive tried . It looks like lipgloss on which is a + . Cute and jearlipz .",30 Jan 2025,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Disappointed ü•π,FlyHigh0160,"I was really excited to try the Fenty Cherry Lip Oil, but it didn‚Äôt live up to the hype. I expected a thin, hydrating consistency, but it turned out to be quite thick‚Äîmore like a 90s beauty store roll-on lip gloss. While it‚Äôs not sticky and smells nice, it‚Äôs definitely not what I‚Äôd consider a true lip oil. It didn‚Äôt provide the moisturizing or hydrating effects I was hoping for and actually left my lips feeling dry once it wore off. Considering the price, I found it misleading and overpriced.",28 Jan 2025,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,kristina1110,"I just received my package, and half of the oil spilled. I‚Äôm very upset.",28 Jan 2025,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Lasts forever,Valefer611,"This lip oil is amazing, the texture is quite thick but it a nice way that will make your lips extremely glossy and not in the way that you feel as if you had honey on them.

,sephorafavi,This is just soooo good like it heals my lips. I will have to say though packaging has to be fixed bc the cap comes right off and leaves stickiness due to the glue. Maybe it changed but overall very good.,3 Jan 2025,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Pretty good üçí,lov3lylivi3,"I bought this a while ago, and it was one of the first lip oils that I have tried. I fell in love with the cherry scent and the shine from the lip oil. I've heard that a lot of people's packaging has wiped off or broken, but mine has been fine. (has gone through rough traveling) Although I like this lip oil, one con is that this cherry flavored lip oil doesn't have much pigment. (might just be this one)This lip oil also doesn't really nourish or soften my lips as it says it would.",27 Nov 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
A must üíú,jenifer1221,"I put this gloss on my lips everyday during school and it makes my lips so smooth and the color is so pretty, it‚Äôs a must need for your bag or purse",27 Nov 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,senoritagabs,I love this lip oil but for some reason this flavor/color was awful. Idk what it was but it just felt super grainy. Bought this lip oil in other flavors/colors and no issues whatsoever,14 Nov 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,maryslife,This product is amazing very hydrating to but it runs out extremely fast and for the price you can find a better and bigger one!,11 Nov 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I‚Äôm not mad at it‚Ä¶,mistressminx,"I bought this on a whim because I was looking for a lip oil that wouldn‚Äôt break the bank. It‚Äôs okay. For as much as it costs it could and should be better - I find I reapply it multiple times in an hour or I have to put a lot on at once. I don‚Äôt find it sticky, and the scent is light which I appreciate, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd purchase again. I know this might be blasphemy, but I‚Äôm not impressed with the entire Fenty line, and most purple like me who are makeup obsessed truly and know what we‚Äôre doing, don‚Äôt really care for it either. I appreciate the shade and product ranges, but apart from that, eh.",9 Nov 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,jaylend,Glossy? Yes. Sticky? No. Hydrating? Not really. Price? Not horrible. This is my second time purchasing this and each time the cap cracks then eventually breaks and I‚Äôm not able to use all the product.,8 Nov 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Changed formula?,kaybo1991,"I used to buy the cherry treat lip oil all the time, just recently it‚Äôs less oil consistency and a lot more sticky and goopy like. I‚Äôm not sure if the formula changed or what or if I got a ‚Äúbad batch‚Äù but this is NOT IT. I won‚Äôt be purchasing again.",8 Nov 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Doesn't last long,maddyricecake,"I was actually disappointed by this honestly, I love the Fenty gloss bombs but this kinda missed the mark. It doesn't last very long at all and doesn't have any tint to it like I thought it would. It does smell like cherry, but not necessarily on the lips only from the bottle. I also don't find it sticky when it's on the lips like some people said. But... my Elf lip oil lasts way longer! For much cheaper.",6 Nov 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,ThePOP,"I‚Äôve actually bought this twice now as I used up the initial bottle which I feel rarely happens with me.  Definitely enjoy this more than I was expecting.  It goes on easily and smoothly with the applicator.  It isn‚Äôt too sticky or runny, stays on just right.  The smell is great too and leaves my lips in better condition especially when used regularly.  isn‚Äôt",24 Oct 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
a major let down,butterflymel48,wanted it to work but it does nothing but make my lips peel yet skin still hanging on so had to rip the rest of it off my lips now bleeding and soar .....i'm fair skin not any visible issues with lips yet..not sure why it's so sticky either..i see no reasons for it to help...i do like the smell ..lov her but they dropped the ball on this one,24 Oct 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,crackedoutmummy,I love the product itself. It smells so good and also leaves my lips very soft but the packaging is cheap. The cap broke and split down the middle so i have to be careful when opening and closing it. I recommend if the cheap packaging doesnt bug you,22 Oct 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Muah üíã,channiie,"Remember Mac‚Äôs lip glass, and it was so shiny but disgustingly sticky. This you get ALL THE SHINE, and ZERO sticking, just hydrated lips. Runs out quickly",22 Oct 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Great product, needs better packaging",absknisin,"This is the only lip oil that doesn‚Äôt leave me with that white line after a couple hours.  It is very hydrating, not super sticky and gives my lips a nice gloss. Took off 1 star because the packaging isn‚Äôt the best. The cap starts to crack after a while.",18 Oct 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Skip this one.,queenkrissy,"I so wanted this to be great, however, it was sloppy/drippy, as a result quickly came off my lips. The bottle leaked and got over my purse.",17 Oct 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Useless,infinitefire,It was half empty when I opened the box. It wore off very quickly. Then It dried out my lips; not hyrating at all. The fragrance was nice at first but after a while it was too sweet / cheap ‚Äúchildish‚Äù smelling. Useless,13 Oct 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Hives,LaLaChanel,"Left a review for the cherry lip mask also, both cherry versions broke me out in hives and gave me an allergic reaction. Only the cherry versions of these products do this. And no I‚Äôm not allergic to cherries. Threw both out.",5 Oct 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,KellzNJ,"I love this lip oil in black cherry. With a moody lip liner, it‚Äôs great for fall.",1 Oct 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Feels so nice!,beautyblonde88,"I prefer this to summer Friday lip oil. Fenty is a thicker viscosity, feels plush on the lips and hydrating like a liquid balm, not sticky either like MAC lipgloss for comparison. Not sure why the negative reviews, don‚Äôt over tighten the top and it won‚Äôt crack.",28 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Nice,serenity56111,"It‚Äôs very hydrating but it‚Äôs very small
But it‚Äôs a good lip oil but the size isn‚Äôt worth the price .",27 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Icky,queenlyricc,"Save your money and just go to claires and buy a cherry lip gloss. It has a sticky formula and gets stuck in my hair, its overly thick and not at all nourishing or hydrating, it also has about 5 minutes until another reapply",25 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
A Must Have,aysiaco,"I LOVE! It‚Äôs become my go-to lip oil/lip gloss alternative. I put it over my lipsticks and where it alone. It‚Äôs hydrating, super glossy and comfortable. Also, the applicator is so soft!",25 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Super Hydrating and Glossy,Kassie2224,"The Fenty Beauty Lip Conditioner Oil is fantastic! It provides deep hydration, leaving my lips soft and smooth without feeling sticky.

Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a moisturizing lip oil!",22 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Lips,Gabyandrade,Feels like plush on your lips plus a bit glossy!! Keeps my lips hydrated for a few hours,22 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Idk maybe it‚Äôs just me,thelifeofperri,"After using thus for a few days, it made my lips peel soooooooooo bad. At first I was like ‚Äúmaybe my lips are super dry rn‚Äù but no. I stopped using it for like 3 days and I promise you my lips were back to normal. Gace",20 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Favourite lip oil,misscryss,"Love this lip oil so much! It‚Äôs not sticky, it looks great on and it smells great too.

Love !,brookeyb,"My new favorite go to lip 
Love the slight tint and the feel is luxurious without being sticky",19 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Mango Sunny-D in a Tube,megbaby,"Feels similar in consistency to the Inn Beauty lip glaze - a thicker, gloss-like lip oil. I prefer this consistency in lip oils as it prevents greasiness and increases longevity. I don‚Äôt find that this moisturizes my lips as much as I would like. However, a lot of lip oils on the market have disappointed me in a similar fashion. I really just use this as a gloss rather than rely on it as a treatment. 

When I tried Dragonfruit in-store, it looked a bit neon. At home and in natural lighting, it looks like a very sheer pink tint. Even though it‚Äôs a screaming hot coral pink in the tube, it‚Äôs very wearable if you keep it at one layer. 

The scent is my favorite feature about this - Dragonfruit in particular smells exactly like the mango Sunny-D if anyone else remembers this from childhood. It smells like a juicy tangerine with a candy/synthetic mango mixed in. Definitely very tart and sweet! If you‚Äôre looking for a fruity scented lippy and are sick of vanilla/creamy ones, this would be a good pick.",11 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Half full,Cuteness0331,Although the lip oil is very nice it‚Äôs not worthy the price.  I received it just over a week and a half and it‚Äôs empty!! I don‚Äôt even use it daily.  Very disappointing Sephora I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again,10 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great product but over priced,daniellemas,Love the color and texture of this lip oil and looks natural on me but it is thicker than other lip oils and runs out quick. For the price it doesn‚Äôt last very long,8 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Very plump lips,joeplaysroblox,After using for not even a day I‚Äôm  in love with this product!!!! It make my lips so plump and perfect,7 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,Rigglett,I wanted to love it so bad but I just found myself reapplying way too often and just never felt like it was hydrating or sinking in,3 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Good smell,Maude811,"I like it, but I generally have dry lips and I thought this would help me keep them hydrated... I still have to use my medicated lip balm and when they are less dry, the oil has lip allows me to keep them like this but not to repair them. I just looooveee the smell !",3 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best Lip Product I've Used!,galgirl342,I absolutely adore this lip oil! It feels so luxurious and smooth on my lips and keeps them hydrated for so long! It smells and tastes super good too. This is a staple Fenty product!,1 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Nice lip oil, but product leaks from tube",Ashjac,"The actual lip oil was nice, but after a few uses product started leaking from the tube no matter how many times I cleaned it. Ruined inside my purse! Wouldn't recommend due to poor packaging.",1 Sep 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Will not stay in my routine.,lynette44,After using. I‚Äôm more impressed with cheaper ones on the market.  It‚Äôs not the best but I will not repurchase.,28 Aug 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Smells fantastic and hydrates!,KPEEZY23,This product is so amazing! It smells like a cherry candy and not obnoxiously scented like medicine. It also doesn't taste like anything. The one thing I can not stand in a lip product is it tasting like something like it being sweet. This lip oil doesn't taste bad either if it accidentally gets in your mouth. It smells great and hydrates so well. I always keep it in my pocket. It doesn't spill and that's amazing. So many lip oils and glosses spill in the packaging so I can't bring along with me in a bag or in my pocket. This has great packing too. It looks adorable and the applicator is amazing! It is a large doe foot applicator that is not extremely hard to get out the package. It does not take a lot of force to open this bottle. So if you have any wrist or arm injuries it is nice.,25 Aug 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Randomly Leaks and Cannot Use Anymore,angelemma3,"I initially loved this product. It is super hydrating and the applicator feels really nice. The smell is great too and it doesn‚Äôt make your lips sticky. But about a month or two after I bought it, it randomly started leaky and got all over my purse. I thought it had a crack or I left it open but after I cleaned it up, it continued to leak out of nowhere. I took it out of my purse and put it on my desk and this is what it did overnight. I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed as there was a lot of product left and this was not cheap. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying it because I‚Äôve heard this happens a lot with this item.",24 Aug 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best lip oil ever,CherryLover235,Absolutely love this lip oil I use this at night like an over night lip mask and wake up the next day with moisturized lips will buy again,22 Aug 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Beware/Gave me a bad allergic reaction,Gmoe21,"Right after using this product I got a terrible sore throat, I couldn‚Äôt even swallow or drink anything and was miserable. I went to my doc and they had no clue what was going on, tests came back negative and it wasn‚Äôt until I came to the reviews of this product and found someone else left a review with my same experience. Obviously we are all allergic to different things but this was a first for me, I‚Äôve never had an allergic reaction to any beauty product so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with this gloss. It‚Äôs a bummer because I loved it but not at the cost of my health.",17 Aug 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Super hydrating!,kazaransky29,Smelt in store and is the small smell as Starbucks dragonfruit refresher. I‚Äôm assuming it has the same hydration as the og cherry one!,15 Aug 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Melita23,"This is a nice lip oil.I haven't tried one before so there may be better products on the market. I have noticed an improvement since using this and the lip mask. I have a habit of picking at my lips, and this has helped. The bottle has lasted over a year for me. 
It is a bit sticky - not in the sense of your lips sticking together, but that your hair will get stuck in it. 
The packaging really needs improvement. The lid cracked early on while sitting on a shelf. I also really struggle to open it. Even if I loosely close it, when I go to open it again, it's so stuck shut that I can't always open it. It somehow seals itself insanely tight. Unless they fixed the packaging, I can't see someone non able bodied being able to use this. I even struggle with a towel for extra grip strength. If you put on hand  cream, absolutely forget it. It ain't happening. 
If you're deciding between Fenty's oil and mask, the mask is much nicer in my opinion and easier to open.",13 Aug 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
favorite lip oil out of so many,olivia73926,"i have like a millionnn lip products and this one has to be one of my favorites. the applicator is sooo soft and it hugs your lips. the smell of this lip oil is amazing, not artificial at all. i need the new dragonfruit one.

My favorite lip product,urcinnamongirll,I wear the fenty treatz lip oil every morning and sometimes during the day. It keeps my lips so moisturized and soft.

"Good product, bad packaging.",Tassixo,"I was so in love with the lip oil. It doesn't smell bad, it applies well. It doesn't last too long for me, but that was my only complaint not worth noting. That was until the cap starting cracking. After about a week of use (applying maybe once or twice a day) the top just broke off. I couldn't open the product again and it feels like a waste. Came to the app to see if others had the same problem and I was sort of relieved it wasn't just me, but disappointed that the cap is that weak. Would love it if this was fixed and now it's just a lost cause unless I DIY it! Wouldn't recommend for that reason since I feel robbed of 24 dollars. :)",3 Aug 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,DanielleJhaye,"I think I might be mildly allergic to this lip oil, so I will be returning, but I did somewhat enjoy it. I moved to a state that leaves my skin super dry so I'm always looking for hydrating products. While this looks and feels amazing when first applied, I found myself having to constantly reapply it. I wore it to the gym, grocery shopping, sitting at work, and no matter what, it seemed like the wear time was maybe 20-30 minutes and it was back to feeling a bit dry. I don't expect the gloss look to last of course, but my lips just didn't feel very moisturized. I may just be someone that needs a thicker consistency, but this one is a pass for me.",27 Jul 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
The new scents are amazing!,eewelsh04,"I got the black cherry scent, I smelled them in store and liked that one the most. I also love the color!

,Addyu13,"I LOVE THIS! I wanted to try it for the longest time and just bought it a few weeks ago and have been using it constantly. I would describe the scent as more fruity than cherry, it‚Äôs not overly strong and isnt medicinal.

I have never gotten compliments on my lips more than when I wear this oil.",18 Jul 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great but‚Ä¶,slayerpreppy,"After 2 weeks of using everyday the bottle becomes empty. This is one of my favorite lip products! its so hydrating, and smells amazing! My only problem is the cap. as many people mentioned the cap cracks. once it cracks, it comes off. i had s problem with kalahari melon. it cracked snd was sticky under. all you have to do is screw the small cap off and you can use it again. packaging should be better which takes one star away from me.",18 Jul 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best lip oil I've used!,kathryn9438,"Yall this is my favorite lip product. I use it all throughout the day, it pairs so good over my tinted balms I use, like pink honey from Clinique.

"A little pricey for a lip oil, but a great product",Zspark,I‚Äôve used this product on multiple occasions and it hydrates my lips quickly. I only use a small amount every time because the consistency is a little too sticky for me and I don‚Äôt like how my hair gets stuck in it and then is sticky when I pull it away. The lip oil is in my opinion too expensive for what it is. But I still like the product and it adds a nice sheen to my lips that is very pretty.,8 Jul 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Quality Lip Oil,Jabby2012,"I live in a dry climate where the Winter weather gets cold AF. As a result I've pretty much purchased every certified ""clean"" lip balm on the market over the last decade. I've been a Fenty makeup/skincare fan since day one so I decided to try their lip oil in hopes the product would be an improvement over lip balm. The product is thick but doesn't feel tacky when applied, cherry scent is very mild and disappears quickly so no issues there. Oil is moisturizing but I found myself re-applying often and ended up finishing the small bottle 
 in approx. three weeks. If the price point was lower, I'd probably keep buying it - oil is moisturizing, easy to use, and layers nicely over lipstick for a pop of shine. I can see using this product in warmer months as I wouldn't need as much but, when Winter arrives, I need something with industrial strength moisturizing power which this lip oil doesn't provide. Lip oils in general are really over-priced for the minimal amount of product received, and Fenty is no exception. Having said that I recommend this product because, price aside, it's a quality lip oil that most people will find meets their needs.",5 May 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

"A quick, hydrating lip oil that I use regularly.",heartiwaffles,This lip oil is one of my favorites. I have the Fenty Ice lip gloss and I really liked that one so I decided to give this a go. It is great in a pinch while at school. The reason it‚Äôs at 4 stars is the product to price ratio.,24 Apr 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
It's Good!,tanyathinks,"This is really so nice. It's hydrating, even when the color/shine was gone my lips felt soft. It's not tacky, although my hair sticks to it like crazy when it's windy out. I love the soft amount of color, the shine, the smell, everything (except I feel like the applicator could be smaller/more precise), but the price feels steep for the amount of product.",24 Apr 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,DaniiFrench,"Had to try this after using and loving the Plush Puddin' mask, and it did not disappoint! I love the kalahari watermelon scent, the big plush applicator, and the compact size of the tube (no shade Gloss Bomb). The lip oil itself is lighter than a gloss, but thick enough to be worn for quite a while, I may reapply 2-3x with eating throughout the day. And I love the way it makes my lips feel so soft while wearing and even after. 4 stars as the tube was not filled up all the way and missing a good 3-4 millimeters of product. I want to guess it's a packaging/manufacturing thing, but the way the packaging is colored is a little deceptive. It's definitely still worth a try though",21 Apr 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

really nice but too little product,asdoghpaw9hu,i feel ripped off lowk cuz they color the bottle to look like there's more than there is... when i received it it was a little less than half full of product yall. if you have money to spend i recommend because it is really nice but if not i would say go for something cheaper because this is a rip off to me,18 Apr 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,mars112004,"I love the way this product feels on my lips. It‚Äôs super thick and hydrating and stays without being too sticky. My only complaint is that it runs out really quickly, probably because it‚Äôs so thick.",16 Apr 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"good oil, melon is just watermelon",venusgloss,"I was hoping this melon flavor would be a bit more like a Japanese melon but it‚Äôs just watermelon. It‚Äôs not bad or overly sweet, it‚Äôs kind of like those dum dum suckers or a lipsmackers gloss. It is a really good lip oil though, I was looking for something more hydrating than lip balm and this is it. If you want something heavier on your lips at night this is great too (as long as you don‚Äôt toss and turn to get it everywhere). If you put it on before bed you‚Äôll wake up with basically the same amount you started with.",16 Apr 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Cap Broke,lnked,"I have been using this lip oil and loved the scent and feel. However, after using it for a while the cap eventually cracked and the inside of the cap came off so  now I cannot bring it outside of using it in my home.

Highly recommend,Melia876,"The only thing I don‚Äôt like about this product is that when I remove the applicator, there is a string of oil, but the part of my lips, and does not leave them dry it is more of a gloss than an oil. The pigment is also very faint, which leaves your lips looking natural, but compared to other brands. This does not dry out my lips, and make them crack.",10 Jan 2024,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Not what I wanted it to do,desertcactus90,"Did not love this, I was hoping to have something that moisturized my lips and didn‚Äôt feel sticky. This was super sticky and dried out my lips.

"Sticky, thick, with strong smell",bagnall,I used this product till it was empty and honestly it‚Äôs nothing special. it‚Äôs really sticky and is very thick to the point where it should be a gloss. honestly the fenty glosses are not as thick as this product. i found the smell to be very strong and at times overwhelming. this did fine in hydration but for what you get there are so many better products,28 Dec 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,karlitagnz,This isn‚Äôt hydrating what‚Äôs so ever. Super sticky and it dries your lips more than hydrating your lips . Lip oil ? More like a drying lip gloss,15 Dec 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Loving it!!,qortice,"The lip oil gives my lips long-lasting shine and hydration. I was a bit worried when I saw other reviews saying the shine doesn't stay, but it did for me. It's perfect for moisture and a dewy look. I like that the applicator is big and has a curve that hugs your lips. The cherry scent is also nice and about what you would expect from something cherry scented. The only thing I would caution is that the formula is pretty sticky in that it is hard to remove and may stick to other things (i.e. napkins, hair). However, you won't feel the stickiness on your lips since it won't weigh them down. Hope this helps!",11 Dec 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Average,boston0811,"I‚Äôm a lip product junkie and lip oils are my fave because they last and many of them add nice color to the lips. I like this lip oil but I‚Äôve tried much better and wouldn‚Äôt repurchase. First, it has a slight cherry flavor, the kind that travels to your throat and gives you a weird filmy taste. Second it does last in terms of adding shine and nourishing the lips but the shine wears off quickly. I like wearing oils to the gym because they stick around during the sweat and movement and this lip oil does not stay so that is a con for me but I do like that it makes the lips feels good. Not awful but the staying power is not good enough for me.",19 Nov 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Good but I didn‚Äôt get to fully enjoy it,nataliaaaa11,Good except I tired to open it one day and it appeared to have sealed the applicator got stuck and when I tried to open it the rest of the lid came with except for the outer shell.‚úåüèª,12 Nov 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Ehh...Save your money.,AsherSinclaire,"Not a fan of this product's texture. It's a somewhat sticky formula and the tactile sensations that I get from this product drives me nuts. 

Also, the value of this product is questionable. You get less product than in the Gloss Bomb and yet it also somehow costs more. I get that the products and ingredients are indeed different, but I can't believe they're so different that they could justify how little product you get. 

This one is going back.",8 Nov 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Won't Be Repurchasing,ChrissyB99,"Disappointed! I've been using this product for a month to give it a real chance, and it leaves my lips wrinkled like I've been swimming. It also caused breakouts around my lip line too, which I've never had before.",4 Nov 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Lovely lip oil,YarnyLibrarian,"This lip oil is lovely. It's very easy to apply and it helps to keep my lips moisturized. As others have noticed, the applicator is fairly large and dispenses quite a bit of product. To avoid having too much on my lips and getting that gloppy feeling, I will apply it to just my upper lip and then rub my lips together to get it on my lower lip. I've found that that works to put the right amount on both lips. Other reviewers noted the cherry scent and flavor. I'm very sensitive to smells, and this isn't overwhelming in either scent or flavor for me.",1 Nov 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,Newbie72,Not too good alone. Used with the Gloss bomb lip plumper clear gloss it‚Äôs amazing. It needs something underneath for moisturizing your lips. It‚Äôs not moisturizing on its own and doesn‚Äôt look good on dry lips. Great with the plumper though!!,20 Oct 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Not worth as much as it costs,Hailee0823,"To be honest, it's not worth the money it's nothing special. The packing rubs off really quickly, and the lid detaches. You're better off with vaisline. The only good thing about it is probably the nice smell",15 Oct 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great product,Clairxrose,My lips tend to get dry pretty often & this product is a great help! It has a very subtle scent & goes on pretty clear. The applicator is really nice & works well. A bit pricy but it has lasted me a really long time.,13 Oct 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Mediocre and expensive,wylime,"It‚Äôs okay. There is very little color, the flavor/scent is very mild so not likely to be offensive (but, also boring.)

I seem to use it up super quickly, after maybe a dozen uses it‚Äôs close to empty.",2 Oct 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Good Moisturizing Product,Kasie00,Not sure what it‚Äôs supposed to ‚Äústrengthen‚Äù but I do like this as a moisturizing lip oil with a nice shine. The scent is subtle and it goes on smooth. Better than some $10 lip oils but not as cushiony as Clayton‚Äôs.,29 Sep 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

This lip oil was a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù for me.,Nautis,"I always love a good lip oil. So, when I saw that Fenty Skin had a lip oil, I was excited to try it. I loved that it smelled like cherries. Like, who doesn‚Äôt like the smell of cherries. I was a little disappointed that it wasn‚Äôt a tinted lip oil. I found that the lip oil felt a little gritty and a little sticky. And I couldn‚Äôt quite tell if the lip oil was hydrating, especially when I would reapply it throughout the day. However, I liked the shine that it gave. And I absolutely, loved the applicator. But overall, this lip oil was a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù for me.",6 Sep 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Buy it!,karma0531,"Everyone who knows me knows that I spend a small fortune on lip moisturizing products each year.  I apply them constantly throughout the day (& night). What can I say, its my addiction , lol.  Anywho, I absolutely loved this product.  It was easy to apply, and my lips felt moisturized almost immediately.  I also liked that I didn't have to reapply for several hours.  There really wasn't much of a cherry scent as advertised, and the product did have a bit of sickness to it - just a little. With that being said, this will be a staple for me.  Get it, you won't be sorry.",2 Sep 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Juicy Soft Lips,Monique423,"Nice product overall. This is perfect for people who have dry lips, Smokers or to hydrate your lips in the winter time. It‚Äôs just the packaging is fragile.

Not Sticky but Kinda Icky,trichology101,"The price is more reflective of the brand than the quality and quantity offered with the product. It's a decent size but just as others have noted it has a very ""cheap"" look and feel to the packaging. 

It does its job as a conditioning and strengthening lip oil, but it doesn't taste great. Because the Fenty glosses taste amazing my expectations were higher. This tastes like if cherry cough syrup was turned into a lip product except with way less artificial cherry flavouring and a way stronger chemical taste. It reminds me of old school lipsticks and how waxy and bitter they taste. 

I don't find it to be sticky, the absorption rate is quick (which could either be a good or bad thing) and the applicator is great for how big and soft it is. 

But because of the taste I would not buy again, it's pretty distracting.",29 Aug 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Must have! Lasted my entire grad night!,brittanybr,Love! Lasts around 1-3 hours and even after the glossy look is gone my lips still feel SUPER hydrated. This and the Sephora lip sleeping max is THE cure for chapped lips in winter and summer.,27 Aug 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
best lip oil out there,Lexinha,literally the best lip oil I‚Äôve ever tried. I‚Äôve tried other high end ones and drug store ones but this one is just different- it conditions the lips so nicely and works as a gloss too because it‚Äôs so juicy! The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the price but anything for riri,24 Aug 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great scent and super hydrating!,HaleyS4894,"This lip oil makes your lips feel really nice and hydrated. Also the scent is amazing. Super cherry scent but also not too overpowering. Love the chunky applicator tip, it‚Äôs one of my favorite kinds of applicators. Consistency is nice too, not too sticky. Tube is very aesthetic and the colors are cute in the package 
The one reason this isn‚Äôt getting 5 stars is not long after owning it the lid cracked and was then cracked the rest of the time owning it. And after using about 3/4 of the tube, the lid separated from the plastic piece attached to the applicator and was sticky and I had to use the remainder without the top part of the lid, see photos. For the price, I would hope they would maybe reconsider the way the lid is designed cause the version feels a little cheap to me.",23 Aug 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love but not the smell,lawlizardo,Love this lip oil. I suffer from very dry lips and it's texture is great and has improved my lips a lot. I would re-buy but not a fan of the smell.,21 Aug 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Good in a pinch,froggyetta,"It‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs not out of the world but it‚Äôs not bad, the applicator is a bit hard/stiff, which I don‚Äôt like, I‚Äôll finish the tube but I prob won‚Äôt get another since there‚Äôs better stuff out there",20 Aug 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

So so,christi1209,"Not sure how I feel about this yet. Really feels more like a lip gloss than an oil. It‚Äôs very sticky, my hair gets caught in it, if the wind blows. Not sure if I‚Äôm going to keep this. Not bad though",18 Aug 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

one of my favorite lip products EVER <3,avahixon,"by far the best lip oil i‚Äôve ever used. its hydrating and has such a beautiful shine without being sticky at all, it lasts so long too. i put it on before i go to bed and i wake up with it still there, to the point that i can still rub my lips together and it looks like i just put gloss on. it outdoes all my other lip products AND it tastes like a lip smacker chapstick. this is the only lip product i reach for, other than my summer fridays. the best!!",6 Aug 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"One of the best out there, long lasting, smooth",Zzza1,"I rarely finish lip products like this. But this lip oil is genuinely amazing. This moisturises my lips really well, keeps in moisture from any lip serum or if I take some of my face serums on the lips (try it sometime, it helps with dry lips). This also lasts very long. I've applied this in the mornings, had my waffles and tea and this stays on. I'd found that I need to reapply this around 4-5 times a day, whereas other lip balms and oils made me want to reapply way more often. This leaves no weird residue after drinks and food either. It also looks great over lip stains and doesn't remove them, and looks good on lip liners and lipsticks.

This may be specific to my experience but if anyone has issues with OCD or skin picking, something about this product made me stop picking my lips when I used it regularly. The texture is thick yet smooth, and since it's long lasting, I don't feel the need to bring my fingers up to my lips to find dry spots and pick them off. There are no dry spots with this lip oil at all anyway. I seriously am so thankful to find a product that helps me with a chronic issue.

To compare with the Dior lip oil, texture is fairly similar though the Dior feels thinner. The applicator is very similarly shaped and sized to Dior's, however the Dior's is more plush. In the ingredients, Fenty has the cherry and fruit oil extracts higher on the list (so more concentrated) and fragrance components lower on the list (so less concentrated, therefore potentially less irritating) than Dior's cherry oils and fragrance. 

I haven't noticed any cracking or breaking cap on mine as other reviewers mention, but I didn't buy this product in the US, so maybe that has something to do with that.",6 Aug 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

So worth it,SunnyNg27,"I know my girlies get it whenever you eat or drink anything with lip gloss/ lip oil on, you end up having to reapply, but I did not have that issue with this product.

Love this,TianaMF,Love this lipgloss. It is a little sticky but I love the glossy shine that it gives me lips. I prefer this over Dior.

the absolute best lip oil,scarlett19,"i‚Äôve tried A LOT of lip oils (dior, nyx, ulta, lottie london, clarins) - this is the best one hands down. it depends what you‚Äôre looking for in a lip oil i guess, but this one is super shiny, nourishing, moisturizing and feels great on the lips. i personally like to feel a lil thickness to the product since my lips tend to be on the dry side i feel like i need as much as i can get. can feel a teeny bit sticky when you first apply but after a few minutes that goes away. my lips look and feel a million times better with this product. a new staple for me for sure.",24 Apr 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Throwback to Bonne Belle - in a bad way,CarrieSCol,"I definitely agree with the other reviews that say it is sticky.

A must have,maryjanevc,"This feels so good on the lips. It‚Äôs not thin like straight up oil but not thick like a gloss either. A great in between. It stays on the lips for hours, even after eating/drinking. And it smells like youre opening a pack of fruit snacks.",22 Mar 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Not cute,Spinch,"It has really nice shine, smell, and taste, but it is INCREDIBLY sticky. The texture is more like a very thick gloss than an oil. I have a hard time rubbing my lips together when I put it on, you don‚Äôt want to apply too much because it pools, and while it didn‚Äôt dry out my lips, it did cause them to peel which is not cute when wearing a lip product this viscous.",16 Mar 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

okay,saffron36,I bought this lip oil on a whim and it's okay. this little lip oil reminds me of the Cherry roll on lip gloss I had back in the day as a kid. With this lip oil you definitely have to make sure not to put too much on or you could definitely get product gathering in the corners of your mouth. This lip oil is moisturizing while it's on but I didn't notice any dramatic softness or moisturization when I took it off. When it comes to real lip oil let's just say I'll go to Dior and some of my other ones that really get the job done.,8 Mar 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Pretty gloss,bonnnyy,"Pretty gloss! It‚Äôs thicker than I was expecting. Kinda sticky, but not in a way where strings of gloss appear when your lips separate. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs hydrating. But it does add a nice shine to my lips and it smells like gushers.",1 Mar 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I love this amazing lip oil!,BalletMom1,"I have tried a bunch of different lip oils, and I like this one the best. (1) Consistency: this is Very Thick. I generally don't like thick ""oils"" that are just like lip gloss; I generally prefer thinner ones. However, this one is different than your average lip gloss. It's unlike anything else I have tried. And, it feels nice. (2) Staying power: this product is amazing! It's the only one that is still on my lips an hour later ... or three hours later. (3) Strengthening: my lips are super fragile and prone to flaking and cracking. I don't know that this product actually ""strengthens,"" but it has hydrated and healed my lips better than Chapstick, Blistex, Carmex, lip masks, lip treatments, and other oils. For the first time ever, I have gone an entire week without flaking or cracks. So, this product gets my highest recommendation.",28 Feb 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
WOWW!,gracefulgazelle,"After using this lip oil, I don‚Äôt need to look any further! This is quite literally the only thing you need for your lips.

Part of my morning routine!,MollyB235,"I really enjoy this formula and the huge applicator feels incredible on the lips! It feels somewhat thick but slick when applied- not sticky necessarily- which is really nice.

Would definitely recommend and repurchase!",25 Feb 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

So far so good,JOSxo,I can appreciate that this is a clean product and also that it goes on smooth and definitely doesn‚Äôt feel too tacky. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs as good as her gloss bombs yet since I‚Äôve only used it a handful of times.. The reason for the 4 stars in the scent. It is a bit strong scent wise & I kinda dislike anything cherry flavored but it‚Äôs tolerable lol,22 Feb 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Kscha12,Love the scent takes me back to the 90s! I like the lip oil I feel like I need frequent application though. Does not really help lips stay hydrated but I like the look,22 Feb 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Heaven on my lips,peachyakult,"Took one star off just because the scent reminds me of cherry syrup medicine, but it only smells for a second! 

I LOVE the way this product makes my lips feel. It's not sticky at all and my lips are very moisturized after using this! My lips aren't crusty and dry anymore! 

Lasts a pretty long while for me and I only have to reapply maybe once or twice a day!",21 Feb 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

WORKS,Dodo1999,"It's STICKY but not too much. It's very oily and hydrating. It lasts long. I've drank water, ate, and yet it's still here (as you can see on my photo). It doesnt create any foam in the corners of the mouth after a while, like poor lip glosses tend to do. The bottle is a bit smaller than expected, though. The smell is really soft and the taste is really good. I love cherry! 
I want to also say that this gloss is clear. It doesnt tint my lips pink or any color. It just gloss it and hydrate it. My lips look healthy.",20 Feb 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Made my lips peel,KateSyutkina,this lip oil is great in the beginning. If u love to apply lip oil 3 times a day probably not a best buy. It made my lips peel and after a week of having it half the product is already gone,18 Feb 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

The smell is horrible,jordynk20,I HATE the smell. It gives me a headache within seconds of putting it on. It also seems more like a clear gloss then an oil.

Overhyped. Invest in a good lip moisturizer or oil,mayaslays,"Absolutely overhyped. It‚Äôs more of a clear lip gloss than an oil (very sticky). The smell is bearable & not overly scented. It hasn‚Äôt made my lips softer in any way, maybe even dryer than usual. :(",25 Jan 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

The BEST Lip Oil I‚Äôve ever tried!,AlexSCW,"Overview: Hands down, this lip oil has no competition in my book. If you want a thick, pleasantly aromatic, non-sticky, moisturizing lip oil that‚Äôs acne friendly, try this out!

Some context, I LOVE lip oils, but the added fragrance so many products have are irritating to my lips. Even worse, using some as a lip mask makes me break out, but my dry Arizona lips could use a little love here and there, so I decided to try out this one by Fenty Skin that‚Äôs supposedly for my exact purposes. 

Let me just say that although this does have added fragrance, it‚Äôs not overbearing in the slightest, and the cherry candy scent sits pleasantly under the nose. It doesn‚Äôt have a particular taste (a hint of sweet is what I would describe it), but it‚Äôs not tasty enough for you to absentmindedly lick it off. The large, fluffy and flexible doe foot makes each application luxuriously soft. The oil itself is thicker but not sticky at all. It does have a ‚Äútack‚Äù to it that makes it satisfying to press the lips together while also preventing the product from sliding off. As a mask, this pairs amazingly on its own or with a light amount of petroleum jelly to really lock in moisture. Despite me using this for several nights, I had no new acne or irritation to speak of, though if your lips are already bitten or cracked there might be a slight tingle on the wound (and if that‚Äôs the case, just use regular petroleum on the lips to heal). 

The color is extremely sheer and the pink tint was only barely visible on my fair skin, and can be used as a gloss topper since the oil is very shiny. 

Overall, this is one of the best lip products I‚Äôve ever tried, lip oil or not. Congrats to the teams that allowed my skin to feel a taste of cherry luxury! Only downside is that the tube isn‚Äôt never-ending. Highly, highly recommended!!!",20 Jan 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Sticky and not smooth like lip oil should be,BeachGirl00,Gave this a try since I love lip oils. I have no idea how this got some many positive reviews. WAYYY too sticky to be considered a quality lip oil. Felt like overpriced Lip Smackers.,7 Jan 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Very disappointing,mirpap,"Was so excited to get this and ended up deeply disappointed. It‚Äôs like an overpriced drugstore or children‚Äôs cherry lip gloss. Sticky, not moisturizing, my lips are like the Sahara 30 mins later and you just need to apply more and more.",7 Jan 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I LOVE!!üòç but it's expensive üò´,Stephanie935,"I love this lip oil but it has some cons.
PROS:ü§©
-Packaging is cuteü•∞
-love and enjoy the applicatorü•∞
-formula is great and hydrating and its not sticky.ü•∞
-it smells great,the fragrance doesn't  give me a headache.The fragrance is just perfect.ü•∞

CONS:‚òπ
-The size is small and its expensive.
I just think that it's so expensive for the amount of product you are getting.üòï

If you are rich or don't care about the price I would definitely recommend. 
I love this lip oil but I'm sure that there's more lip oils that are quite as good as this one and less expensive.

when I ordered this product I regretted buying this because I realized I was getting so little product for an expensive price.
But after trying it I don't regret buying it as much. I love this product but I'm not sure I would repurchase because of the price.",7 Jan 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
This is the business,DanielleDijoy,"I have atopic dermatitis and am allergic to almost everything but this lip oil feels amazing on and is very hydrating. I am so glad to have something to use that makes me feel like a normal person, rather than being limited to pulling out my sticks tubes and tubs of aquaphor for my lips. Buy it üçí",5 Jan 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Yessss,anders11,This is the bomb. So smooth and smells sweet. My new fave for sure!!!,1 Jan 2023,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Super moisturizing!,franstar88,"Finally got my hands on this product after it being sold out for the longest time!  Super moisturizing and a little bit goes a long way!  I‚Äôm one to always reapply lip balm often but since using this, it‚Äôs kept my lips so moisturized that I don‚Äôt need to use my lip balm as much.",29 Dec 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Must-try and must-have,suusuuu,I love this lip oil and it's worth the hype. It's not sticky at all and smoothens my lips a lot. This is perfect shine but not as shine as a lip gloss on my lips. I really love the cherry sense while using this. Long-lasting hydration.,28 Dec 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Wouldn‚Äôt repurchase,SassB14,The main reason I‚Äôm giving this 3 stars is because I don‚Äôt feel like it has any effect on my lips. The lid also broke pretty easily.,25 Dec 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
use this w/ Laniege sleep mask for the softest lip,Ahlee1217,"I really enjoy using it. It's pretty thick so expect to ""feel"" like something is on your lips.

I love it!,swrstgvb,"So moisturising and glossy, it also smells amazing not too strong.",23 Dec 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Literally a must have.,Jackolatern,"I just got this product and when I tell you my mouth dropped. This lip oil is NOT sticky at all which is amazing. In my opinion, the product on the lips doesn't even feel like a lip gloss. I've heard a lot of people comparing this to a lip gloss but it's honestly not. The shine gives a beautiful and lasts forever. I took a nap for a couple of hours and it was still shiny and as hydrating. The scent is just perfect. The only thing I can really compare it to that you may know of is a cherry icee. It smells exactly like how a cherry icee would taste. It's not overwhelming either. I literally cannot stop applying this product GET IT!! Even if you're debating on getting it, try it out and see how you like it. It's definitely worth it!",21 Dec 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
feels amazing,ybet08,"smells like cherry, super shiny, and i love the applicator! feels so luxurious :)",13 Dec 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,aec145,"So this was the first lip oil I‚Äôve ever tried and will not try another one any time soon. This is so amazing I use it so much I‚Äôve already bought like 2 or 3 backups.

Beautiful Lip Oil,Predivna,"I absolutely love the smell of this lip oil. Leaves my lips feeling hydrated and so nice and shiny. Does not feel super tacky/sticky, but just right. I do wish there was a bit more product for the price, but other than that I love this lip oil!",19 Nov 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Shiny and juicy lips,ingrid88,Nice texture. Not thick but not thin. Stays moist for about 4 hours on me. Pretty moisturizing; my lips always feel smooth and hydrated afterward. Great smell. Makes my lips look full and shiny. Applicator is probably the best part--all you need is one dip and there'll be enough product to coat your lips nicely. But expensive and not a lot of product.,18 Nov 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love it!,RileyWasser,Love this stuff! It smells nice and does not have a sticky feeling. It looks glossy and pretty but also adds moisture. I love the applicator too!,18 Nov 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Just ok‚Ä¶,kaybo1991,"I really wanted to love this, I love Fenty and anything cherry flavored. This is just ok. It smells like a cross between cherry and play-dough, it‚Äôs more like a gloss then a oil. Not much shine payoff either.

Definitely give it a shot ü§û,Pepno,"If you're a fan of the laneige sleeping mask you'll really like this lip oil too.

Horrific smell,kellybartnicki,"Product itself was great and just what I was looking for, but the scent is horrific! Highly suggest smelling it in store before purchasing, it made me queasy :(",30 Oct 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Ugh So Disappointed,mmariiee,"Okay so I really wanted to love this product :( It smells pretty good and the tube is small and cute. However, I found that my lips got extremely dry and started peeling. It actually reminded me of when I used to buy those cheap smackers lip gloss back in the day. I ended up needing to use the Laneige sleeping lip mask to rehydrate my poor lips. Not worth it.",28 Oct 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,twotokes,"The best lip oil. I wore it today, ate lunch and it stayed on. It‚Äôs not sticky at all and literally just stays on the lips and looks so juicy.",26 Oct 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

BEST LIP OIL EVER,lialepiane,This is honestly the best lip oil I have ever owned!! It makes your lips so soft and has a nice glow to it. 10/10 definitely recommend!!,19 Oct 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Overpriced Smackers lip gloss,Danyab,"Just buy a pack of Smackers lip gloss. Thats literally all this is. Wears off very quickly, smells bad, and is far more sticky than an oil should be. It doesn't moisturize at all. Im not sure who wrote the positive reviews, but this product isn't worth more than the few dollars for a children's lip gloss. It's a cute bottle, thats it. Very disappointing",19 Oct 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Gee07,"I'm 50/50 on this lip oil. It's really thick, which it makes it seem a little sticky, and the scent reminds me of kids play lip gloss, but not as strong. The texture is nice, i think I would love it more if it was unscented and not as thick.",18 Oct 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Beauty Supply Store Lipgloss,BronzedBritt,This doesn‚Äôt quite seem like a lip oil. It‚Äôs not hydrating in the slightest - I find myself reapplying it throughout the day. It gives a nice gloss on the lips that dissipates pretty quickly. Hard pass for me.  Are these paid reviews? Lol.,5 Oct 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Packaging is eliteeee !!,ebunnies,literally went through both the washer and dryer without a single scratch. not a single crack in the tube. no product seeped through. i‚Äôm still in awe. shout out miss rih rih for only doing the best always and saving my life.,2 Oct 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Buy this!,crazy4cosmetics2,"Perfect lip oil! Not greasy, not sticky, lasts for hours, use alone or over a lip stain, mild fruity scent, no taste, and hydrates beautifully! Always sold out so if you can find it, buy it!",1 Oct 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,SweetPastels,"Tried this because I‚Äôm a sucker for any cherry themed lip products and it‚Äôs pretty good! The formula is hydrating, the applicator is nice and soft, and it‚Äôs cute. Doesn‚Äôt smell or taste very good though",30 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
My Favorite Lip Oil,SkinBestest,"Fenty definitely has the best lip products, from the lip paints to the glosses all are phenomenal. The texture of this oil is perfect, not sticky or too thick. My lips are typically dry and this has saved them.",30 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
impeccable hydration!,vanliu,"love the packaging, applicator, and formula. hate how little it comes with and the scent is a swing and a miss. the fat applicator takes up half the bottle and the scent lowkey smells like medicine.",26 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Okay but not excellent,Princess143,"I love the smell and the consistency and it tastes good, but it‚Äôs not very moisturizing for my lips, personally. I love the original black chapstick the best. This product is definitely overpriced.",25 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Not what I expected,megz196,"This feels like it‚Äôs actually drying out my lips when I wear it. It‚Äôs glossy but like a lip gloss, not a lip oil (way thicker and more sticky than expected). Doesn‚Äôt feel like lip care.",25 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Inna1234,Tastes quite off once i apply it to my lips. Tempted to wipe it off immediately‚Ä¶. but it is hydrating.,23 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,LibraHart,After using this product over the past few weeks I feel like it‚Äôs just okay. I probably wouldn‚Äôt re-purchase it. ,22 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Please pass on this.,AVL22,"Shocked at how over hyped this is. If you‚Äôre looking for a clear LIPGLOSS for $25 then go for it. I was looking for something different and something to recover my extreme chapped lips. From reading the description I really thought this would be a lip OIL and something to recover my lips. This is just a clear sticky lipgloss and personally I hate lipglosses because I‚Äôm not 12 anymore. Also if I wanted a clear lipgloss that smelled like subtle cherries there‚Äôs no reason to be paying more than $10 for it, very small amount as well. Only positive is the Cute packaging",20 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Absolutely a must have !!!,shamycru,"I have been trying to find something like this for so long and let me tell you something this formula, AMAZING. I literally will continue to get this because I don‚Äôt think it can get any better between the texture and the smell it‚Äôs just perfect! Definitely a must have !",15 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love!!!!,DukeRomeo,"I love this product! Even though it‚Äôs a lip oil, it‚Äôs the perfect amount glossy. A little sticky like a gloss but still very hydrating. I kind of wish there was a way to get a bigger size of it but good for traveling.",14 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,veeronica1,"i love love love this, makes your lips look so good and feel good, it smells like a light smell of cherries",13 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs great for travel!,hereisqueenlis,After using this product for the past few weeks I liked it. It is a good cherries scent but the oil just stays on top of my lips until it dries a bit sticky. It‚Äôs still works for hydration though!!,13 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
My favorite lip oil,Lisa0509,This is my new favorite lip oil. It is thick but not sticky. I‚Äôm not having to constantly reapply. And the slight sweet smell is great. Definitely would recommend.,12 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Pass on this one, you wont regret it.",Ebbbyyyy,"I wanted to love this product bc I‚Äôm such a fan of fenty beauty products but this is awful. First, it smells like those beauty supply lip glosses you get for $3. Then, its not conditioning at all. In fact, it made my lips chapped and rough. I also thought it would be more of an oily consistency but it has a cheap thin gloss feel to it. Definitely my least fav product I have gotten from Fenty.",8 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Tried on in store,gymnast43256,It‚Äôs overhyped and very sticky more of a lip gloss than an oil,6 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best lip oil!!!,sairabieber,I ran out after a month and am completely obsessed!! I reapply multiple times throughout the day and am extremely happy with the quality. My lips always feel so hydrated and stay hydrated. Fenty skin popped off w/ this lip oil and is definitely worth every penny + rebuy!,5 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Holy grail,vlt15,Love this lip oil so much!! I haven‚Äôt had chapped lips since I started using it!!,2 Sep 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I wanted to love it..,katdionnee,Ugh. I wanted to love this so bad. I love Rihanna and have quite a few of her products. They are all hit or miss. This product is a miss. Doesn't do anything and doesn't last on the lips either. On the search for another one :(,31 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love,ameliekua,"Doesn't add much color to the lips but it makes them look super glossy and juicy. Super comfortable and not sticky. The smell is not overpowering, aka you don't really smell it once it's on the lips. It's yummy (more like a tart cherry popsicle/candy rather than a sweet almond cherry if that makes sense). I really like the applicator. I don't like the bottle packaging design tho, it looks cheap. A bit pricey for what it is? But the product is good.",29 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Valyyy,"Got this lip oil about a month ago and honestly I don't love it or hate it. It is just meh... the scent is really nice, it's not that thick of thin, it is actually perfect. The only thing with is that it doesn't last that long and does sit just there. The whole package and presentation of the product is cute and compact but not worth the money in my opinion. If you're like me that is always kinda licking her lips this gives a VERY greasy sensation on the tongue, it actually is bothering, but it goes away kinda fast. Wouldn't purchase again to be honest",29 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great scent and thick formula; lacks color,lilylovesblush,"From the image, I  expected glossy red color added to my lips upon application. I was a bit surprised that it was sheer; it felt a bit deceiving. But I do truly enjoy the thick, nonstick formula of the lip oil, which makes application easy; and the cherry scent--it's divine! The packaging is also adorable: a minimal, lavender applicator and the cherry on the container that fits and looks pleasing in your purse. Overall, it's a wonderful product if you're looking for sheer, glossy lip hydration with a fruity scent, and nothing more.",28 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I WANTED TO LOVE IT SO BAD,Lauren0461,"I bought into the hype. I wanted to love this so bad. It coats the lips nicely, but never actually sinks in to moisturize and hydrate. It just sits there.",27 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
good but cracked???,julibby,I love love LOVE this lip oil. Maybe even better then dior. But i‚Äôve had for a month or so and the cap is cracking ?? I haven‚Äôt dropped it or anything. It hasn‚Äôt spilled but be cautious.,25 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Scent is too strong for my liking,Meli0131,"I would give this 5 stars if it weren‚Äôt for the smell. I can‚Äôt pinpoint exactly what it smells like but I am sad to say that it is definitely too strong and not for me. Usually after a few minutes of wearing a lip gloss/lipstick, I‚Äôm able to ignore whatever it may smell like but that is not the case for this lip oil. Will probably have to give to my sister.",25 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing:),Ewaaaaaaaaa,"I love this product! I think it is a good size for the product branding. It does have a very lovely cherry scent, but there is a hint of something else that‚Äôs not cherry. I would buy buy again!",25 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,KKesh18,"I love this lip oil. Reminds you of a lip gloss, smells good too. Kind of wish they had another flavor other than cherry but it works.",25 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazingly Moisturizing,phatshel,I have fairly dry skin and live in the northern winter states. I use a ton of lip balm to try to keep my lips moisturized and I‚Äôve tried about every brand from Sephora. This one has been one of my favorites. I use it multiple times a day because I love the feel on my lips and it keeps them moisturized once the glossy surface has been removed from drinking.  The feeling is more of a lip gloss (thicker than an oil) but not sticky/tacky at all. Love this product!,24 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Just a Gloss - Not Bad Though,QueenMelbs,There is literally nothing special about this Gloss. I say Gloss because it doesn‚Äôt feel like an oil at all. It can be kind of sticky and if you lick your lips after it has a really weird slippery texture. I like the smell and it is nice for a little sheen on the lips but not what I was expecting.,24 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Rebeccajoaf,"I am obsessed with this product!!! It leaves lips moisturized, and it smells incredible.",23 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,Teriiza,This product looks very pretty on the lips at first. As it begins to wear the product starts pilling on my lips and it‚Äôs kind of embarrassing. It‚Äôs not my favorite.,22 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,ursiebrown,"I don‚Äôt know why, but I‚Äôm obsessed with this lip oil. When I first got it I was hesitant. It was way thicker than  I thought it would be and a little tacky, but it smooths onto my lips so nicely. The sheen is a whole vibe that has me in my feelings, it smells so good, and it‚Äôs a little tacky, but not overly sticky.. which I was nervous about given the thickness. It is a bit expensive, but I want one for all of my bags. I love putting it on before bed too. Def will be buying again.",22 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
meh,MrPotato,"it‚Äôs very thick, i expected it to be more serum-like, but it‚Äôs basically a lip gloss, very sticky but it does smell really good!",21 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,iamqueenlos211,"Wish I knew how small it was before ordering. Also it‚Äôs not worth the price tag, just an expensive beauty supply store gloss. I‚Äôm sure the ingredients are not of a beauty supply store gloss, but it sure does feel that way. Will keep because I don‚Äôt feel like returning.",21 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Save your $$$ Don't believe the hype,KittyPretty,I love Fenty but this a lightweight clear oil nothing special maybe the ingredients and cute packaging. Big applicator Lightly scented overpriced deluxe sample sized. Prefer Milani Fruit Fetish lip oils. Half the price twice the size thicker yummy tinted  scents.

,ellyistired,"I‚Äôve been using this with my morning and night skincare routines, it feels really good on the lips and smells amazing. It is on the thicker side but not too thick or sticky for me personally. This has been really hydrating for my lips too, which are chronically dry and peeling no matter what I do. If you‚Äôre willing to spend a bit on a lip oil, I say go for it with this one.",17 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Honeybee2021,"It‚Äôs a lot stickier than I was expecting. Reminds me a little bit of a lip smacker, but way more expensive",17 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,DeeRad93,It‚Äôs a great product. Smells delicious. I am however a little surprised this is called a ‚Äúlip oil‚Äù. To me this feels more like a lip gloss.,17 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great product,Kmccoy11,"I really have enjoyed this oil! It feels good, smells good, and makes my lips look great. I would repurchase.",15 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Plus and Minus.,Blairbear1991,"Thanks to Bzzagent I was gifted this Fenty Cherry Treat Conditioning & Strengthening Lip Oil in exchange for my honest review. To be completely honest, I thought the packaging was painfully basic for such a mystique high end brand like Fenty. I found it so surprising. Quality wise, it was fine, a little thick for me, but then again I have yet to find a lip oil I actually love. On the bright side, I thought this Fenty Lip oil was beautifully light, making it so comfortable to apply and enjoyable to wear....thankfully so as many lip oils tend to be heavy and even greasy. Overall, lovely lip oil, unimpressive packaging.",11 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,hybridantic,I saw a lot of good reviews for it online but personally I find it okay. The color doesn‚Äôt really show up but it has a thick consistency.,11 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs sold out for a reason!,1makeup12,"I understand the hype with this product! I like the smell (it‚Äôs more of a blue raspberry scent than what I would consider to be cherry), the large and soft applicator, and how the lip oil leaves a glossy finish without feeling sticky at all. I hope fenty comes out with more shades because I don‚Äôt really notice any tint on the lips. This formula in other shades would be super pretty! Also I‚Äôve got to give a shout-out to the cherry designed packaging it‚Äôs so cute!",10 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,jhay232,"At first I really liked this product. Loved the smell, the texture, the applicator and consistency. However, it doesn‚Äôt do what it claims to. I have dry spots in the corner of my lips that I have been trying to get rid of. My actual lips do feel just a tiny bit softer BUT I have been using this daily applying 2-3 times a day and at night with no relief for my issue. So, with that being said I‚Äôm not really sure how hydrating or conditioning this is. I feel if it was the dry corners of my mouth would not still be there with no significant change. And no, it‚Äôs not a cold sore on my mouth it‚Äôs just dryness at the corners . I do like it , just doesn‚Äôt moisturize.",7 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Drys out your lips,rosiecheeks95,"At first I loved this. The applicator, the texture not being sticky, the smell, but after a few days of use this product made my lips insanely chapped. I dont recommend. Pretty bummed since I am a huge fenty fan.",6 Aug 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

I am so particular with what I apply on my lips and this is my favorite product by far. The cherry scent is fairly light and leaves little to no taste on the lips. An amazing find especially for the price point!!",29 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great Lip Oil!,catsandboba,"This is a fantastic lip oil. I really love the mild cherry flavor and the oil itself is super hydrating, you only need a little bit! The applicator is a good shape and the bottle itself is cute and convenient to use! Overall would recommend!",28 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Such a Treat!,KaiCruz17,"I was gifted this in exchange for my honest review. I was pleasantly surprised & SO blown away by this product. I‚Äôve used lip oils before as well as leave on lip masks such as the Laneige Lip Sleeping mask, & I would have to say this surpasses them all. The Lip Sleeping Mask was an essential part of my nightly routine but it has been replaced by the Cherry Treat Conditioning + Strengthening Lip Oil. Since first use, I have not even touched my lip glosses or any other lip product for that matter. I was even embarrassed to take a photo of it for this review because I had already used the majority of the product because I fell in love with it lol. It‚Äôs the perfect lip product. It‚Äôs moisturizing even when it‚Äôs faded & leaves my lips moisturized & soft all day long. The packaging is sleek, cute & simple. The product is cute & small & able to fit in your pocket. The doe tip applicator is probably one of the biggest I‚Äôve ever seen but I love it so much & I‚Äôm convinced it should be on every lip product. The finish of the oil is clear & is perfect for everyday/nightly wear alone or over your favorite stain. The texture feels wonderful on the lips, not sticky whatsoever. The only thing that doesn‚Äôt thrill me is the scent, it‚Äôs reminiscent of Cherry Chapstick but if that‚Äôs your thing, by all means. It isn‚Äôt at all an overpowering smell & does fade so it doesn‚Äôt bother me much & I can overlook it. I would recommend to anyone looking for a moisturizing lip product to nourish, condition, heal & moisturize while still looking for a little extra shine  This was the first Fenty Skin product I‚Äôve tried & I‚Äôm now curious to try the whole line. It has honestly become my favorite lip product & I will repurchase to make sure I‚Äôm always stocked!",27 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,paisleyalysse,great lip oil! stays on the lips for a long time without sliding off. perfect consistency and not sticky at all. smells like a cherry candy. the applicator is the perfect size. it gives your lips just the right amount of color. very shiny.,27 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,judedolton,i had heard so many amazing things about this oil before i was able to get my hands on it and oh my god‚Ä¶ LOVE.  the wand is great for bigger lips and it smells so amazing.  my lips feel great after using this and it stays on for a long time especially for a lip oil.  i hope they make this in a bigger size cause i‚Äôm already running low.,26 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,lesslovesbeauty,Love it. My fianc√© and I apply this right before bed and we wake up with our lips feeling smooth and hydrated. This helps keeps the moisture on our lips,26 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Rihanna did it again,TammyLynn82,Obsessed with this lip oil. Had to buy more to give them to my friends and family. I love Fenty skin so had to try these. Fell in love immediately. This is my go to item where at home or on the go for my lips. Not sticky. Very luscious.,25 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great minus the smell,scotia334,This is my first lip oil. It feels really comfortable and smooth on the lips. Not gummy. Overall I really like it. The scent does bother me a little. It smells overly artificial. Like those old lip smackers. Maybe some people liked them but the smell and taste of them was always gross to me. I can smell it for a good while so one star off for that. But other than that I love it.,25 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,akiirah,Love it! Extremely moisturizing and as a person with bigger lips the wide wand allows less swipes to be necessary,25 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I like it!,KitKat76,"It‚Äôs a nice lip oil! It‚Äôs a bit on the thicker consistency, slightly sticky, nice gloss. Reminds me of a lip gloss, but thicker and less glossy. Nevertheless, it looks beautiful on the lips, keeps them moisturized, and smells divine.",24 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Buy,Buy,Buy...give Ms.Fenty her props!!!!!",Marikaallen,"Ms.Fenty keeps taking my coins!¬° Run don't walk to purchase this lip oil. This lip oil is moisturizing, makes the lips so soft and conditioned. I wish Sephora was not sold out because I wanted to purchase 3 more. I have really dry Iips and this has made a amazing difference.",23 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
A MUST HAVE AND FOREVER REPURCHASE,glamorized87,"I mean this is hands down my favorite lip oil on the market. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my Dior lip oils but there is just something about this one. I constantly have this on no matter what. The smell is also amazing!!! You need this in your life.",23 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Worth. Every. Penney.,kwgill,I cannot say enough good things about this! It makes my lips feel so soft and hydrated. Not to mention I‚Äôve received quite a few compliments! I will absolutely restock as soon as it‚Äôs available again.,23 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
it isn‚Äôt bad but its okay,bakubabe,Before I started to use this product my lips weren‚Äôt chapped but after my 3rd day of using this I noticed my lip were getting chapped. But after a week my lips went back to normal and I could say that it felt softer but there isn‚Äôt a big difference. You can barely ‚Äútaste‚Äù the cherry but when open the product you can definitely smell the cherry scent. I personally love using the Clarins lip comfort oil more than this one but that‚Äôs just me there are many other lip oils that are better than this one but you do you bestie :),22 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Summer FAV!,zleigha,I became obsessed with lip oils during the pandemic and prior to this my favorite one was an overnight oil from a skin care brand but for going out this one is incredible ! It adds a nice gloss that isn‚Äôt too slick or sticky. It has a subtle sweet smell and it makes my lips feel like heaven. I definitely recommend all girlies keep this in their summer bags !,22 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Sophie1127,Super moisturizing and feels so good on the lips. Also lasts me a very long time! The color is super flattering,22 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
great lip oil!,shelbykw1313,it feels so nice on the lips and gives a nice shine. it's moisturizing and has a slight pink tint just to add a healthy color to your lips. it is thicker almost like a gloss but isn't sticky,22 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Linuska,"Very nice texture.  Could be used just like a gloss, in the meantime it's working on the lip skin.  Love the smell, taste.  Not too sticky.",22 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
best lip oil ever!,lunaanessa,I absolutely love thisssss !! Finally a good non sticky long lasting lip oil ! First of all the smell is so good not overpowering at all ! The oil is so smooth and not even sticky at all ! It stayed on for a good while ! After it came off my lips were still feeling hydrated ! So happy I got this !,20 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
softening! but the scent is hard to stomach,sadiebee,"So far, I‚Äôm really enjoying this lip oil. The wide applicator makes for an easy, drip-free application. The formula isn‚Äôt sticky and has a lot of lasting power - I‚Äôll notice it on hours later after drinking, eating, sleeping, etc. And my lips feel noticeably softer after use.

My only complaint is the flavor/smell. It has the same artificial cherry scent as Twizzlers, which I personally hate (I know, I know!). But the scent isn‚Äôt enough to drive me away from using it.

Overall, would buy again - and hope they release different scents!",20 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Cherry goddess,courtneyeliz420,"I have been using this yummy juicy goodness on my lips every day (2 times a day) for the last 3 weeks &I can honestly say I love how my lips look &feel. They have been super soft &plump looking.. also it's super moisturizing without feeling sticky.. I use when I do my skincare routine in the morning &at night before bed. I love this stuff so much I will have to buy a backup for sure once it's back in stock. New holy grail lip oil, I legit just wanna drench my lips in it! Ohhh &did I mention it smells amazing. 10/10 !!!!!",19 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Must buy!!,inlovewthejojo,"My new favorite lip go to!! A must buy!! Makes lips look luscious, fuller and hydrated without being too much obsessed!!",19 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
love but too thick,Jaxkey01,"Feels good on the lips but it‚Äôs a bit too thick. 
It does indeed treat chapped lips and gives it a very plump feel and look. No need for lipstick honestly if you want a natural glossy look. The only downside of this the formula is thick so it‚Äôs like applying glue and trying to get it evenly on your lips. Other than that, great product!!!",19 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,RhiBebe,"I literally just received this product and so far it seems worth the hype! I love the smell, it‚Äôs definitely like a cherry/strawberry candy scent which I surprisingly don‚Äôt mind. It‚Äôs not super pigmented which is also fine because Rihanna advertised that it‚Äôs not supposed to tint your lips very much at all. It feels very silky and moisturizing on the lips, and I love how even it looks. The applicator is also worth mentioning, I didn‚Äôt need a second pump and it‚Äôs very soft and squishy and wide. We‚Äôll see if it actually moisturizes long term but so far, I am impressed.",19 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
love it!,shopkenzmccoy,"Great consistency, not to runny or thick. Pleasant cherry smell. Love that it is both day and night use. The applicator is nice and cushioned. Worth every penny. Leaves lips shinny and conditioned.",19 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Sheer hydration,Vivipanda,"Used this for a few weeks already and while I love it as a gloss, I don't think it is hydrating enough on it's own. A little goes a long way, but it shines if you apply it over a balm or after a lip mask to lock in moisture. You will need to reapply every time you eat. I love the plump and glossy look it gives and the sheer formula allows you to apply on top of a lip stain for some color. The scent is pleasant but noticeable if you don't like the taste. Overall it is a good lip gloss that will lock in moisture but if you have extremely dry lips then look for something with more moisturizing ingredients.",19 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,AsiaF99,I love lip oils and this is definitely one of the best ones I‚Äôve tried! The cherry smell is not too overpowering and this is very moisturizing. It also give you a nice shine and not thick at all. The applicator is even better! I definitely recommend this.,19 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Mixed Feelings,KrissyDGee,"I have used the Fenty Skin Cherry Treat Conditioning Lip Oil for 2 weeks every night before bed. I love the hint of cherry flavor and the glossy look however, My lips however never really seemed conditioned. The next morning they were not noticeably softer. I did not notice much of a moisturizing effect.",19 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Lip oil,Sydbrenn,This is the most amazing lip oil you will ever use. It‚Äôs not as oily as I thought it is literally like a lip gloss and it‚Äôs AMAZING. I love it!!! Everyone needs it.,18 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Delicious, Shiny, Hydrating",CelestiaKitten,"I've tried a lot of lip oils in my quest for soft lips and this one by far takes the cake over the rest that I've tried. This feels soft and moisturizing, but never leaves that greasy film that some others have been known to leave behind. It's also hydrating but not ever sticky. I cannot recommend this enough. I can't wait to see if they come out with other flavors, as I will definitely purchase",18 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
prefer chapstick,pdxcats,I do not feel like this cherry treat conditioning + strengthening lip oil did anything. It just felt like lip gloss. The cherry scent was noticeable. It did not hydrate my lips at all. I rather use chapstick since at least it works.,18 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,JessieGirl74,This is beautiful super glossy and light. I‚Äôve tried plenty of glosses and They seemed the same just heavy and glossy for about 10 min and gone had to reapply. I wish these good glosses would be in bigger packaging.,18 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Good product, just didn‚Äôt work for me",aniaa47,"Honestly, the product itself is not sticky, thick & long lasting. The scent is quite delicate, the reason this product didn‚Äôt work for me is mainly because of the oil like coating it‚Äôd leave on my tongue (i have a bad habit of licking my lips) for that reason it won‚Äôt be a product I‚Äôm reaching for in the future.",17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
It healed my lips!!,kib16,"This stuff is amazing! I am guilty of biting my lips when I am working so they're always dry and sore. This stuff has healed them and conditioned them so well!! It has a nice light cherry scent that isn't overpowering and this is not sticky at all. I also noticed that it lasts a while too, compared to other lip glosses that don't. I will always have one on hand.",17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
You need to try it!,heatherpalomo,"I love this lip oil! I have super dry lips and this is def a life saver. It's not too thin or too thick, it's just right. I like to wear it on top of my lipstick sometimes or with a lip liner too.  You need to try it!",17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Pleasantly Surprised,Danielle917,"I was pleasantly surprised by this lip oil! Smells great, but not overwhelming. It was very hydrating and one coat lasted a long time. It's not overly tinted-great for everyday wear.",17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,MasonS23,"New favorite lip oil, been using this every day. I have really dry lips, so I‚Äôve been preferring lip oils to lipsticks this summer, and this has been in my pocket every time I go out. It gives you perfect big glossy lips, hydrates really well, and lasts a long time. I honestly can‚Äôt think of any way they could improve this, it‚Äôs been my favorite makeup product this summer. Can‚Äôt get enough of the cherries, too. 
Also-My cousin tried this on a night out with me, and loved it so much she bought her own the next day.",17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best ever!,MadisonMarie95,I absolutely love this lip oil! It leaves your lips feeling so soft. It looks good on and isn‚Äôt too sticky. It doesn‚Äôt have an overpowering odor either like some do.,17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
My new FAVORITE!!,brookiejeane,I love this lip oil. It smells amazing and keeps my lips so soft and doesn‚Äôt dry them out. It also has a hint of color so you can wear it alone or I like to add a little lip liner with it sometimes. It also has natural ingredients so I love that!!!,17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Perfect for travel,modelbehaviour,I brought this with me on vacation and it was the perfect gloss/lip treatment all in one. It gave my lips a slight red tint and gloss while also hydrating my lips like a chapstick (but better). I would highly recommend.,17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
LOVEEE IT !,ByBrown,"LOOOVEEE IT !! It doesn‚Äôt feel too sticky , the scent is amazing and definitely leaves your lips moisturized. I bring it everywhere I go because I love them so much ! Super Recommended",17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
THE BEST,bbrida587,"I absolutely love this product. It is super moisturizing & long lasting. The scent is perfect, and it doesn‚Äôt taste gross if it accidentally gets into your mouth. The applicator is the perfect size.",17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Recommend,Lmontgomery06,This provides a nice protective barrier for the lips and keeps them feeling moisturized. I highly recommend this product!,17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Icky, Sticky, Not for Me",BKSmith15,"To be clear, this is not a substitute for chapstick, though it might work as a lip gloss. I saw no discernable difference in my lips except a slight tinting, which wasn't necessarily what I wanted. It's very sticky, like rubbing Elmer's between your lips. The cherry flavor is pleasant, but it's oddly reminiscent of flavored lubricant, which makes the experience off-putting.",17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Just like a lipgloss,maishh,This lip oil is really pretty to th eyes also has a really nice applicator it smells like cherries also this product is a decent size. I gave it one less star because the lip oil is not as hydrating as I expected.,17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Lip Oil,Angelface12,I love this Lip Oil it keeps my lips very moisturize. Not only it‚Äôs moisturizing but it smells very good and last a long time . I was so happy to receive this product for free from BzzAgent. I will definitely recommend for anyone to try out.,17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

The best,Jennrebt,Is a bit small but I have never put anything better than this on my lips in my life. It stays on almost all day long even after eating and drinking and feels super soft,17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,bll1029,"Very nice product. The cherry scent isn‚Äôt overpowering which I like. The applicator is really soft and feels nice on your lips. This gloss isn‚Äôt sticky at all, and helps my lips feel moisturized when they‚Äôre chapped.",17 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Pretty, not beneficial",NeonClover,"It's nice, but would not say this is an oil, it's like a thick almost waxy gloss. Has a fragrance that's a little plasticky",16 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing,noorw,Amazing products. The smell isn‚Äôt too much so if your sensitive to smells this product is great. It makes my lips soft and I left it overnight and woke to amazing results.,16 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
The best lipgloss I‚Äôve ever tried.,lianelili,"Here‚Äôs a bold statement from a lipgloss aficionado regarding Fenty Skin Cherry Treat Conditioning + Strengthening Lip Oil: This is the best lipgloss I‚Äôve ever used, and I‚Äôm known for being the one who always has my lipgloss within my reach. The consistency of this gloss is perfect because it isn‚Äôt sticky nor is it too thin. It imparts just the right amount of sheer tint of color while making my lips shine and it lasts. Honestly, I‚Äôll never use another after trying this. Exceptional product.",16 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love it,jessicadawnxx,"I like that it‚Äôs not sticky, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a cherry smell but definitely a tinted pink non sticky gloss! It makes my lips smooth as well.",16 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
lip oil leaves your lips soft and silky,rachelcorona,I love how Revitalized this lip oil leaves your lips very shiny and smooth I would have I would I definitely have to recommend it to family and friends a 10 out of 10 and once I run out I will have to be buying more,14 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Obessed!,cocojonelle,"My first initial thought was that it was going to be sticky; another brand everybody hyped up. But it proved to be the exact opposite being moisturizing and leaving my lips glossy. The unique doe foot applicator makes it easy to apply the product evenly on the lips compared to other brands with a smaller wand. And small enough to carry with me everywhere.I panic a little when I don't have it and soon as this container is finished, I intend to buy one or three more and get one for my mom and me.",14 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,freshfacediva,"I really like this lip oil. Leaves lips super shiny but not sticky. Also, it definitely keeps lips hydrated. I used it overnight and would wake up with my lips still having moisture. 
Here‚Äôs the issue: it‚Äôs so small!! I literally received it on 7/1 and it was finished on 7/11. I used it daily. 
That‚Äôs the only thing I would say that I don‚Äôt like about it. Otherwise, buy it!",14 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,GorditoYBonito,"I really like the lip oil, however it‚Äôs not my favorite that I‚Äôve ever used. This lip oil feels more like a really thick gloss than anything else. While that isn‚Äôt a bad thing in itself, the problem is that I have to really try to apply the smallest amount on my lips, then spread it. Because the oil is so thick, did you have any dead skin on your lips, it will become easily noticeable after applying the product, not similar to how applying actual hydrating oil would make chapped lips look. I think I would feel more comfortable calling this a lip mask than a lip oil. I will say however, I enjoy both the smell and the hydrating effects of the oil after I use it. The applicator is nice, and despite the cons, I still find myself reaching for it, because when you apply the right amount, it looks and feels good on the lips.",14 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love it!,mamaofdragons3,"I'm obsessed with this product! It's such a pretty gloss on the lips, super hydrating, long lasting and non-sticky...plus it smells delish!",14 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,sarabeauty101,This lip oil does everything it claims to do. It leaves lips nourished with a shine. The smell is also light and pleasant. I would have preferred more of a red tint to really give the full cherry experience.,14 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
A Truly Wonderful Cherry Lip,TennisBeauty25,"I overall really enjoyed this product. I did see some change to my lip's general appearance. My lips were noticeably softer when I used this product twice a day for two weeks. The results of the product are enough for me to recommend it to anyone. Usually, I'm not too fond of scented products, but the cherry scent here was not overpowering. The lip applicator was terrific and very helpful when applying the product. The packing was beautiful and was a joy to hold and look at. I would use this product for years to come and recommend it to anyone. If I had one complaint, it would be that it was a heavy oil, and it took some time for my lips to adjust to the product's weight. The product results are enough for me to continue to use. I enjoyed this!",14 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,ModelTopicBrian,"Before I get started, I would like to start off by saying that I received this product as a complimentary sample to test and then review.  The texture of the lip oil feels hydrating, smooth, and although is slightly thick, has a good amount of slip. Making it easy to spread across your lips with minimal effort. The cherry scent is strong and very soothing to the mind, mouth, and lips. The lip oil also provides immediate and long lasting hydration, making it ideal for those with dehydrated lips in need of intensive care.",14 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,amanda0000,"I love this lip oil. It‚Äôs always tough to find a lip oil that doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or tacky, and this one feels super smooth. I love the taste/scent; it‚Äôs like candy! Perfect to accentuate your natural pout. Amazing lip oil; high fan.",13 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!!,Shookiej,This lip oil is amazing. I tend to have very dry lips. This keeps my lips soft and moist. I typically apply before bed and sometimes during the day. A little goes a long way. I love it so much I bought a bottle for my sister.,13 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Juicy, pouty and conditioning!",JennyK28,"I love this lip oil! The glossy pout it gives the lips is so juicy and pretty. I thought it was going to be sticky at first application but it evened out and felt for glossy and hydrating like a normal lip oil. The doefoot applicator is huge and cushiony so it feels so soft. The packaging is so sleek and has the ""clean girl"" esthetic and I keep it in my purse now. The last aspect I'll mention, is the scent. The lip oil is cherry but the scent gives off a more raspberry candy smell, so it kind of brings me back to my childhood which is fun!",13 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
So glossy!,StarLite33,"Omg this stuff is so addicting. Not only is it super glossy and incredibly hydrating but it stays on your lips for a long period of time. I have to hide this lipgloss from my daughter and her cousin because as soon as they see or hear the tube, they immediately start puckering. The smell is like candy and makes you tempted to taste it. Doesn‚Äôt leave a bad taste in your mouth either if you accidentally lick it. It is so much better than all of my glosses and right now my go-to l. Cruelty free and black owned make this a serious must-buy product on top of the fact it is the bomb. Highly recommend.",13 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Amazing stuff!!,NeyaQ,"Oh. My. God. This is incredible. My lips were chapped and peeling almost to the point of bleeding‚Äîfour days later, they were soft and healed. It's much better, in my opinion, than the Laneige lip mask (which is what I used to use). It isn't very sticky at all (it just feels like a slightly thickened oil) and smells heavenly. It's a bit pricey, but oh so worth it!!",12 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
In love,Lhsieh,"I have completely fallen in love with this lip oil! I have been reaching for it whenever my lips need some hydration. It is not stick or overly oily, it‚Äôs absolutely perfect. And it has the most delicious cherry scent. I will for sure be buying another one!",12 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Now this is what I call‚Ä¶ MOISTURIZING!,bbybrooke,Fantastic product - no wonder it sells out so fast. The applicator makes this lip oil super easy to apply.

LOVE IT,ssophiemariee,"I absolutely love this product, it smells so good and it looks just absolutely precious on everyone! I would definitely buy another.

,spikesolo,"I absolutely loved this lip oil! It comes in a very cute little bottle that fits easily in any bag. The applicator is thick and soft which covers lips easily in a single coat. It gives a natural glossy finish and is not too sticky. It also has a very simple yummy cherry smell that is not overwhelming when you put it on. Finally, it actually conditions my lips and makes them feel super hydrated and soft. Overall, I really enjoyed this Fenty lip oil and would purchase it in the future.",12 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Inlove,MounaV,"I love this lip oil. It is very hydrating and stays on your lips quite well even while eating and drinking. The colors are beautiful and glossy, which really enhances the appearance of the lips. I am definitely more of a gloss gal, I never wear traditional lipstick. I'm so crazy about this product and I will most likely continue to use it. I am so happy that I have received this complimentary sample, otherwise I might not have known about this product. I honestly hope that they never stop selling this!",12 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
SOOOO GOOOD!,omoo,"I love this lip oil! It has definitely made a difference in keeping my lips moisturised. It lasts for a very long time, with me only have to re apply once a day.

Amazing product,Ricvrd0,I absolutely love the smell and feel of this lip oil! Rihanna you have done it again. I most enjoy using this as a top layer to my already established lip routine and it creates a look that is long lasting and leaves my lips looking hydrated. This has become an everyday item for me!,12 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best. Lip. Oil. Ever.,brohang,"This lip oil is phenomenal. I have naturally dry lips, and I hate stickier lip oils and gloss, but this stays without being sticky, moisturizes, tastes and smells great, and is extremely easy to use. In particular, I absolutely loved the applicator; in itself it's a wonderful experience because the head is so fluffy and helps fill the natural creases of your lips. I would add also that because the applicator is so porous, it looks like the oil won't last very long, but I experimented and was able to use the applicator for 3 coats of both lips. All in all, a lovely product I'd see myself getting again. My boyfriend LOVED it as well, drove him nuts :) 

**I received this product as a free sample",12 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,hwoosl,I loved the feeling of this lip oil! You can instantly feel how moisturized your lips are. I really like how the applicator feels too and the size of it! Fenty never misses with lip products! I just wish the price was a little lower but that‚Äôs what you get for quality I suppose.,12 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best lip oil,WendyLucy,"This Fenty Skin Cherry Lip Oil is amazing! I absolutely love how my lips feels afterwards. I use this lip oil 2-3 times a day so far. Fenty Skin never disappoints, love this product!",12 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
10/10 Very Nourishing,thisisangie8,"This is a great lip oil!  I like my lip products more balmy & thicker so lip oils aren't generally my jam.  I tried this after hearing an influencer talk about how much they love it (and we like the same type of lip products).  Did not disappoint!  I haven't tried the Dior lip oil so I can't compare but this feels light but balmy.  Lips feel nourished while oil is on the lips and long after it wears off.  Barely any color - maybe slightly pink.  Smells like strawberry candies, not cherry, and it's a pleasant scent that wears off. I also really like the applicator.",11 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I love it,ElenaBaydan,"Super excited on receiving this lip oil from Bzz Agent and Fenty skin for my honest review. It smells delicious. Perfect lip oil for my always dry lips , love the bulky applicator . The oil is really hydrating and leaves my lips super soft and juicy . Love the packaging and the bulky size of it . Will definitely last me for a while . The hydration stays long even after it dries down . Definitely worth the money and definitely will buy more after I‚Äôm done with this one .",11 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
GLOSSY AND JUICY,angelicapintoo,This product is amazing this lip oil smells amazing and when you drench your lips with cherry it gives it such a nice juicy and gloss affect I really love how this layers over lipstick and lipliners too,10 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Jazzieh318,What are some benefits of owning this product? This product leaves my lips very soft and has a delicious scent. I will definitely be purchasing this product once I run out. I will be recommending this to anyone who deals with chapped lips.,10 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Kris8333,"It makes my lips very soft and shiny and I love the applicator. The only issue I have is the smell, as it smells like a cheap artificial cherry flavor like kids' makeup.",9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Sweet As Cherry Pie,chanelchic8,"I bought this lip oil a couple of weeks ago, but I wanted to use it for a bit before reviewing. I love it!! My lips have been so smooth since I started using it, and I only have to apply it twice throughout the day. Even after it wears off, my lips still feel hydrated. It also smells so good‚Ä¶like cherry pie. Not overly sweet though. Definitely an essential product for me. I already bought a backup!",9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Summer essential,Aiyat,Absolutely loved this product! It is super lightweight and not sticky at all. Some other lip oils I tried are very sticky and don't work well on top of lipsticks but this one is amazing! I would totally recommend. It's literally a perfect essential for the summer.,9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love this Lip Oil!,Mandeis96,I was really impressed with how soft this left my lips. The applicator is wide and easy to use. I like how moisturizing the formula is and the slight tint of color it leaves behind. This product delivers high shine and leaves your lip looking healthy and hydrated.,9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
outstanding,BerryBeauty92,"Things I like :
- the size perfect for my pocket or purse
-the application is very unique and effective and delivering the product to my lips
- the smell is sweet nice and faint. After all there are 3 kinds of cherry extract used to make this product
- my lips feel not only nourished, but cushioned, moist and plump
- I like that the oil has some hold, it‚Äôs not sticky but it‚Äôs thick enough that it won‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre drooling from the oil bleeding everywhere which I have expect I‚Äôm other brands

What I didn‚Äôt like 
- that it doesn‚Äôt come in a bigger size 
Ps. Bought at the fenty site so it won‚Äôt show as verified in here",9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Lightweight,Soccermom3414,"Omg this is the nicest lip gloss I have ever used! I love how light weight it is, other lip gloss is thick /heavy. You get the perfect shine with that sweet smell of cherries. I personally like that it‚Äôs a small applicator that fits in my small pockets if my shorts. I will never have to go without lip gloss and everything looks better with some shine",9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,OliviaRoseMonty,"This lip oil made my lips feel so smooth and hydrated. The oil was a little thicker than what I‚Äôm used too, but not sticky. It glided on and gave a cute glossy finish. However, I did feel like the product was a little small for the price point.",9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great ingredients great lip oil,Diamxnd,The Fenty Beauty Cherry Treat Conditioning + Strengthening Oil is hydrating & adds the perfect pinch of color. The color is not an intimidating red if you are like me and do not wear red lips everyday. Lips look healthy and hydrated. I find myself applying the oil multiple times a day because it feels that nourishing compared to other lip oils I‚Äôve tried. If you want to try a lip oil I would definitely recommend Fenty Beauty Cherry Treat Conditioning + Strengthening Lip Oil!,9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love it!,Lightbrightt,"I was able to test this lip oil through bzzagent.com. This is my new favorite! It's keeps my lips hydrated and is long lasting, and not sticky, and also has a nice light cherry scent. I will be purchasing and definitely recommend it!",9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Please restock immediately,kaliyahford,"This oil right here has no right to be this flawless. From the consistency to the smell & the applicator!!? Child, get you one! The price may seem a bit crazy, but I‚Äôm telling y‚Äôall it‚Äôs literally THEE BEST lip product I‚Äôve ever used",9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Looooove it,Tilah,First time using a lip oil and I love this. The applicator makes it feel so nice going on and it‚Äôs very hydrating. I don‚Äôt feel like the scent is super overpowering but it does smell decently like cherry. I really like that it‚Äôs also not sticky at all. Definitely going to routinely purchase this one!,9 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Reminiscent cherry vibes!!,markgarita,"Keeps my lips soft and supple! I love the smell, it reminds me of the fruity clear gloss that I used when I was young! Definitely very reminiscent. It does have a thicker consistency than a normal oil would so it feesl like a lip gloss and slightly tacky to the touch. I think it‚Äôs great for keeping my lips moisturized and glossy!",8 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,luckiii28,"This Fenty lip oil is pretty nice. It‚Äôs a thick but not sticky texture. It‚Äôs smooth and hydrating. 
It doesn‚Äôt have any color to it, it applies clear. 
It does have a strong cherry scent to it. The scent is okay. It‚Äôs a bit reminiscent of cherry cough medicine. I don‚Äôt mind it that much but I can see how others wouldn‚Äôt like it.",8 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,yeliaht,easy appliance and good for dryness! the cherry smell is just like what i thought it would smell like and is pretty strong. although it is more like a lip gloss than an oil.,8 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,rachcherryy,"like the scent and it does feel really nice, but not very oily it‚Äôs a little sticky and very small amount of product",8 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Not the best,AnoshaSheikh,It does what it says that it conditions the lips but I can‚Äôt get over the horrible taste; Not sure if I just received a bad one but there was nothing even remotely ‚Äúcherry‚Äù about it; I wasnt a huge fan of the product.,8 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Good, but scent is not for me",Lexibcc,Does as described! Very moisturizing and looks great on lips. The only drawback for me is the smell. It has a very strong artificial cherry smell. If you are okay with that I would recommend this but if you are like me and associate the smell with medicine (and do not want to be having to smell that the whole day) I would choose another product.,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,SashFierce14,"A beautiful, fragrant, fruity, hydrating lip oil in a bottle! I love the way this smells, the way it is easy to apply, goes on like shimmer, and hydrates your lips for hours. My lips feel so much softer and supple!",7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
love this Fenty cherry lip oil,Jessicapaka613,I received this product for free from BzzAgent and wow... this product is amazing..it is silky and shiny and not overly sticky.. it adds the perfect amount of color and shine to my lips while also making them look nice and moisturized and almost plumped without it being a plumping gloss.  it smells amazing and looks so good! I wasn't expecting it to be so good but it's amazing !! I absolutely loved this product. 10\10. thank you BzzAgent!,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,katelup12,Smells amazing!! It hydrated my lips so good and left no sticky feeling whatsoever. I definitely recommend to those with very dry lips because I‚Äôm currently on accutane and it has worked wonders for me.,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
100% satisfied,LisaNOCAP,I‚Äôll be adding this too my favorites definitely the smell is amazing my lips are so moist I‚Äôm very happy with this product RIRI delivered ‚ù§Ô∏è,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing Lip Oil,amcutean,This is the best lip oil I have used in a long time! There is no tacky sticky feeling there is no residue left over! I highly recommend this oil if you are looking for a nice light fragrances lip oil! Overall the applicator and formula are one of the nicest out there that i‚Äôve tried!,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
it‚Äôs great!,Cydneyyb98,"This is so nice!! I bought 2! Not sticky, the cherry smell is nice and not overwhelming! Very hydrating and gives the lips a nice glow, the applicator is very soft as well I don‚Äôt know what the negative reviews are about",7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Yael16,"I love this lip oil, is so hydrating and not sticky",7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
The best,nato1,"This is the only lip oil that I‚Äôve tried that doesn‚Äôt leave my lips feeling tacky or weird when it wears off. Usually when I use other lip oils like the Clarin‚Äôs one, my lips feel sticky and dehydrated after it wears off. This Fenty lip oil feels better than a lip balm when it‚Äôs on and after it wears off. The main differentiator of this product in comparison to other look oils I‚Äôve tried is the texture. It‚Äôs not too thin so it won‚Äôt wear off your lips after two seconds and just leave them feeling greasy, and it‚Äôs not too thick ‚Äì it won‚Äôt leave your lips sticky. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future",7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Good Lip oil,lneelise,Like the product for my everyday use. It is very hydrating and the flavor is amazing too,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love it,chloette,"I think this lip oil is amazing! It is very balmy and slippery, not sticky or too thin or thick. I love the color of the product, because even though it doesn‚Äôt leave any pigment on the lips, it looks really pretty in the tube. It smells like candy fruit, but in a sweet way, not an artificial chemical way. I find it very nourishing on the lips but it doesn‚Äôt last all day. My one gripe! Otherwise perfect.",7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Shyannerose,Made my lips super soft and hydrated. It smells delicious and I love that its not a sticky gloss,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing,ShaeHamari,"Love love love this! It makes your lips look so amazing and glossy, smells amazing and the applicator is so good. The doe foot is extra big so someone with smaller lips may have more issues but I found I loved it more than a regular doe foot.",7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Delicious and comfortable,daddybunny,Lips have never felt more hydrated! The product sinks right into your lips too so it doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or heavy or uncomfortable at all. Perfect amount of shine and tint. And the flavor is out of this world!!,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Obsessed!,Hann0971,"Obsessed! Finally! I found a lip oil that isn‚Äôt too thick and doesn‚Äôt dry out my lips. This lip oil is very smooth and hydrating, and on top of that it gives you a perfect gloss look for any style you are looking to accomplish. It also has a thick ‚Äúduck foot‚Äù shape to the lip bristle which works for applying it evenly and smoothly. On top of it feeling like heaven, it also smells like it too. I would recommend this for anyone who has chapped lips and struggles to wear lip gloss because of it. This is for you!",7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,misswhitxo,I received this product from influencer. I really love this lip oil I love that it leaves my lips feeling great and looking juicy. I also really like the light cherry scent. I was worried it would be a strong candy like scent but wasn't at all.,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,pandax21,Very moisturizing and lasts pretty long! Gives a good shine to your lips,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Wow,Lreis1,I‚Äôve been suffering from dry and darkening of the lips and this lipstick has helped more than anything I‚Äôve tried before. It keeps the lip i and moisturized until you decided to wipe it off. I love the sort of bent applicator and it smells yummy. It‚Äôs also vegan which is amazing and extremely important to me.,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I love this oil!,carlyyyybb,I love this lip oil so much. If you love a cherry lip oil/scent this is perfect and it is so nourishing without being sticky. It feels super good on the lips.,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs Poppin‚Äô,MarkShock,I like to consider myself an amateur lip conditioning adviser for dudes.  I started with chap stick and have moved up the evolutionary lip care ladder.  I love this stuff! It is very lip gloss-esque so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend slathering it on and going out into the world if you‚Äôre a dude but at home it does a great job sealing and protecting my lips while leaving them feeling smooth and hydrated.  My wife who deals with dry cracked lips regularly also thoroughly enjoys this too and I often find it mysteriously sitting on her nightstand when I‚Äôm sure I left it on mine lol.,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best Lipgloss I‚Äôve Ever Used,mealsie,"OK, so let me say right upfront that I am a lipgloss addict. I keep lipgloss by my bed in the bathroom in the kitchen in my car in my purse at work, because I cannot be without it. This 
Fenty Skin
Cherry Treat Conditioning + Strengthening Lip Oil Is a revelation for me because it has everything I look for in a lipgloss: the perfect consistency, unbelievable shine, extreme softening properties, and it lasts for a long time. I truly hope they don‚Äôt stop making this because this is my new favorite and I love it!",7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Nourishing, non-sticky",Caysey,I love this product. We‚Äôve had record high heat here that leave my lips looking chapped and dry. This lip oil is very nourishing and non-sticky. It also smells and tastes good! It leaves just a hint of color. I also love it‚Äôs compact size so I can carry it like a chapstick!,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best Lip Oil,Jaws10915,"This lip oil did exactly what it said it would do - condition and strengthen my lips. I enjoyed using this product as it smelt delicious and repaired my dry, cracked lips. I use it at least twice daily and will definitely continue to use in the future.",7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
obsessed,zoedaniellee,I really love this lip oil! it‚Äôs so hydrating on my lips with out being sticky. It smells amazing and i love the applicator,7 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
MY LIPS FEEL GOOD,monixoxo17,It was my first lip oil I have ever tried im so sad to see it it out of stock but it‚Äôs definitely the best thing to moisturize your lips I don‚Äôt think o had to ever reapply it through my 8 hour shift they stayed hydrated and looked really glossy without that sticky feeling also it doesn‚Äôt have a flavor which I love ! Once it‚Äôs back in stock you should definitely grab it before they are gone !!,6 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Finally a lip oil without almond or coconut!,lovebeauty92,"This lip oil is so conditioning and feels great. I also love that it has a slight tint and I love the applicator.

Fav lip oil,RRamos20,I am in love with this cherry treat lip oil. It leaves my lips feeling very soft and smooth. I also love the applicator it is very different from the standard size ones. Highly recommend it,6 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Favorite lip oil,MackieB,I have a few lip oils from various brands and this is my favorite! I love the stubby size so I can carry it everywhere instead of chap stick. So nourishing and non-sticky!,6 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love It,wellsnik,"I received this item for free for reviewing purposes. All I got to say is that I about damn near use the whole bottle already lol. Love it so much I have tried other lip conditioning oils and as other lip conditioning oils are really oily kind of just runs off your lips especially in the summer, this one stayed put added a lot of moisture to my lips especially when used after exfoliating your lips and putting the product on and sleeping with it overnight no more cracked chapped lips,absolutely love it. I highly recommend if you like a thicker consistency of a lip oil other than something that is a really oily that has a nice cherry scent to it.",6 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love it,Yanilm55,Love this has a small hint of cherry and it doesn‚Äôt linger. It makes my lips feel soft it does wear off but that‚Äôs normal. I would recommend this product m.,6 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!,jillygehringer,"I really love this lip oil! Cherry is my favorite and go to fruity scent so I really liked the scent of this product, although the scent may be too strong for some people with sensitives. I like how it comes on clear and doesn‚Äôt have a tint because I like clear lip oils more than something that has a bit of color because it feels more natural on my lips. I absolutely adored the applicator as well because it feels so soft and goes on my lips smoothly. The packaging is very adorable as well with a little cherry picture on the outside. But as for the effectiveness of this product I found it to be super hydrating and moisturizing! I had no problem with this and I love using it! It‚Äôs my new go to summer lip oil!",5 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,sephoraleilani,"Color lighter then expected, very sticky and the cherry flavor taste very artificial.",5 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Overhyped,samanthayousef,"I didn‚Äôt find this lip oil to be moisturizing or hydrating as it claimed. It goes on clear despite being cherry-tinted in the bottle, I was disappointed with this as well. It smells like sweet cherry candy, it may be too much for some people who are sensitive to smells. It was very average, definitely an overhyped product. I wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to repurchase this, I‚Äôd recommend gisou for actually hydration or Kosas (for a tint of colour) instead.",5 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great product!,channing916,"I love the smell and the look of this lip oil, but I am giving four stars because it still has a bit of a sticky lip gloss feel to it.  It does not ‚Äústrengthen‚Äù lips like it says in the description, but it does give a good barrier and it helps prevent your lips from drying out.",5 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love it !,ciara1212,"This lip oil is definitely the best yet ! I love how big and wide the brush is making it so easy and convenient to use !! It's wide enough to get my entire lip in one swipe!! And I love how thick it is , it gives my lips that extra touch of securness that I search for in a lip oil !! It's definitely leaves my lips feeling refreshed and beyond fabulous!! Definitely the best I've gotten my hands on ! And the cherry tops it all off  ! Fenty outdone themselves on this one !!",5 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
yeah‚Ä¶you need this!!,alexandlarsen,LOVE this lip oil - RiRi never misses!! It is extremely hydrating and juicy leaving a glossy finish without being sticky or caking up in the corners. Smells and tastes wonder and the applicator is to die for,4 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Eh,buickmackane,Not as glossy as I expected it to be. Somewhat of a thin consistency. Evaporates off my lips. The taste is also a bit off; subtle cherry I suppose? No color pay off either. I love the new stains Fenty has but this was kind of a dud.,4 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Aronda1995,"This is a really good long lasting lip oil. It last for quite some time however this does not play well with lip gloss. Any lip gloss I‚Äôve tried to put on top of this (lawless forget the filler, Patrick Ta, Buxom) gives me white mouth in the corners. However, with the Dior lip oil, that doesn‚Äôt happen. So for me, it‚Äôs better on its own.",4 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Just okay..,kimberlyy92,"I absolutely love FENTY products but this was a no for me. It does not compare to the Dior lip oil, which I am obsessed with. The shine is there but it‚Äôs not as hydrating and you get less product. The color appeared more clear on me rather than a sheer wash of color. If you like Dior, stick with that.. you get what you pay for!",4 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
love,deefecteau,Best lip oil I‚Äôve tried!! Even better than the dior lip oil (which I love) because it‚Äôs less sticky. It‚Äôs very hydrating and I love the subtle cherry scent.,4 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great Lip Oil!,MakiZ,"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I honestly love this lip oil. It‚Äôs not sticky at all and leaves my lips feeling moisturized for a long while. The cherry scent is nice, but not overwhelming. Lastly, the applicator is a flat-ish head that is very nice to use. Overall, I would definitely recommend this lip oil.",3 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
don‚Äôt walk RUN to buy this,princesstab,i love this so much! it‚Äôs not sticky and it‚Äôs not heavy on the lips. it hydrates my lips perfectly and they look so healthy. rihanna has done it again,3 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,wetbananasplit,Very thick and has a nice flavor to it. Left my lips feeling moisturized and stayed on for quite a bit.,3 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Not sticky,amyfit29,I love this lip oil. It has beautiful bottle with a cute cherry picture on it and it smells like cherries. It makes my lips feel so moisturized and looks very glossy. The best part is this product is not sticky at all so I can wear all day and reapply with no problem.,2 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love it,SmrithiSuneeth,Great product.  I totally love it. It is a combination of lip oil and gloss. It has a light cherry scent which I love and it hydrates and conditions the lips. I love how my lips looks after applying this. Totally obsessed.,2 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great applicator,Flames,"I love the applicator on this lip oil. It is a big, plush doe foot that quickly covers your lips. The scent is a mix between cherry and blue raspberry. It is small enough to easily fit in my purse. I would say that it is a mix between a gloss and a li oil, leaning more towards the glossy side. If you are looking for more of a gloss consistency, I totally recommend it.",2 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Stunning,abiivazz,It‚Äôs sits on the lips beautifully live the shine and the hydration stays all day,2 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
nostalgia lip smell,Cacia,I love this lip oil! The smell is very 90s like her lip gloss and it makes my lips shine. Hydration is pretty good too. Not amazing but not what I bought it for.,2 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Delicious candy,GloriaCastillo,"Smells delicious! Is not super sticky but I mean is gloss, it smells like cherry candy and just a little bit goes a long way",2 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Nice product,Daisy1234567,This is a good lip conditioning oil! It smells likes cherries and really leaves your lips so soft. My only con is the price since the product is so small. I recommend it if you have extra money to spend on this lip oil. Nice product but it is not a must have item.,2 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,eccxntricsxul,"I like this lip oil. It kind of has the consistency of lip gloss which I didn't entirely expect, but it has helped my lips recover after wearing lipstick that dried my lips out. Has a very light cherry scent, I almost wish it were stronger. Overall still good.",2 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
CHERRIES!!!,AlexG7202,"I want to first start off by saying how much i LOVE the scent of this lip oil, it smells just like cherries and kinda taste like it to in case you were wondering lol. But i have to say this is one of the few lip oils that I've tried and actually DELIVERS it leaves my lips so soft and hydrated!!",1 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
from someone who actually purchased,amyxaz,"Small for the price. The scent is fine, it's light but you can still sometimes catch a whiff of it. Texture is similar to the rare beauty lip glosses; I personally think this is more smooth than sticky (wouldn't really call this sticky at all actually). Color is pretty nonexistent once you put it on, and though this is a lip oil, it is glossy but not super glossy. However my rating isn't based on color or ""gloss"": the price isn't worth it, I also don't think it's very conditioning; once the product wears off (which is about 2 hours max if you aren't eating or drinking) my lips still felt the same. I prefer the laniege lip glowy for a hydrating ""gloss"" type, or their daytime lip treatment balm for a quick dry lip fix. I only used it for two days and applied a few times (atleast 3) through each day and before I slept, so if there are strengthening/conditioning benefits I didn't see them (laneige daytime treatment fixes my dryness in one day with 2 applications). So a star for scent and a star for it not being sticky.",1 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,pr1025,I received this for free in return for a review. Very nice and I like how it doesn‚Äôt have a heavy color to it. Love the chunky applicator.,1 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Nice product.,Kam12345,"I received this as a free promotional product. I love how it makes my lips look glossy. Although, I wish it hydrated my lips more than it does.",1 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Arpita0140,"It is very hydrating. Almost like lipgloss. I really like the applicator brush on this, the material is very sturdy and it gets a good amount of product. The one thing I didn't like, is the scent. It smells like something you would by from claires.",1 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,margahreetah,"This is a very nice lip oil, it smells great and leaves your lips super soft. The shine is gorgeous but it is slightly sticky, and feels more like a gloss. I love the ingredients and how moisturizing and hydrating it is!",1 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
CHERRY ON TOP,Lauren1477,"RiRi knocked it out of the park, again. This lip oil is so shiny, a very subtle pink color, and keeps your lips moisturized all day. I love it both on its own, and as a glossy topper-- especially on top of her hydrating lip tint once the glossy sheen fades. This product packs a ton of shine and a little goes a long way, so I can see this lasting a long time. Plus, the hydrating feeling lasts a long time during the day too. This didn't feel oily, so much as a very hydrating and thick gloss. Which I appreciate! Thank you Bzzagent and Fenty Beauty for sending me this to try and review! I would definitely recommend it!",1 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Sticky,lalalester,Very sticky. Caked up in the corners of my mouth like little lip boogers in my mouth. Wasn‚Äôt a fan of that. Very thick feeling when you apply. I didn‚Äôt really notice any conditioning difference in my lips post wipe off but I have always had pretty hydrated lips. The smell and consistency of it reminded me of being back in the early 2000s and having the different flavored clear lip gloss tubes and trading with all my friends. Nostalgic.,1 Jul 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Lip Moisture and Shine!,AlexLLLLLLLLLLL,"I received this product for free so I cannot comment on the $24 price tag other than this product does seem like it'll last a while. I was considering new and perhaps pricier lip treatment options so this came at the right time. It leaves a shine on your lips for quite a while so be prepared for that. I think the stickiness and not really bothersome if you aren't putting your lips anywhere. It's putting oil on your lips, after all. The smell is your typical cherry smell / flavor. You know the one. And the applicator feels nice on your lips. It does seem to be helping my lips out... no real complaints from me.",30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,karmacouture11,kind of sticky BUT it last long n my lips were super soft. love the cherry scent as well.,30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,BellaLutzo,"I recieved the Fenty Skim lip oil to try it out.  Although I really liked the product and how it added a lot of moisture to my lips, it also made me breakout on my lips.  This product is just too much for my lips to handle.",30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
This stuff smells like FRUIT SNACKS,MsUltraRawkstar,"Yup. You heard me. This lip oil smells and tastes like fruit snacks. Thanks to this, my lips are well-hydrated, smooth, and happy, both immediately after putting on the lip oil AND in the long-term. I only wish it came with more product, it seems like it should be a mini!",30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Not what I expected,Lizabeth22,"I own other lip oils and I really like them so I was thrilled to try this Fenty lip oil, but this felt like something my mom used to buy me at the dollar store. There is nothing oily about this. It is a straight up super thick lip gloss. It's probably the thickest lip product I've ever used. It's very sticky. The cherry scent smells like those fruity bubble baths for kids. it's a very nauseatingly sweet scent. The ""oil"" also looks really red in the tube, but I don't see any of that on my lips. I'm so disappointed in Fenty with this. I really wanted to love it, but this was a fail.",30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
AMAZING,midnightwithme,"Omg this stuff is better than any other lip oils I have tried, including the most expensive ones . I have found my HG",30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Triet,I highly enjoyed this product. Firstly the scent is great not over powering like most cherry scented balms. It comes in a compact size wold be nice if it was a bit longer the wand is wide  so it fits well on bigger lips. The consistency is stickier than I expected. I didn‚Äôt expect my lips to actually be softer without using a lip balm first but after the stickiness wore off my lips were left pretty soft. I will be purchasing in the future.,30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,ayedriawnuh,My new go-to!!! I love the applicator and how soft this makes my lips!!,30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Just okay,lshewokis,"(I received this product in exchange for review)
I wanted to like it but I think it is just not for me. It feels and smells like a child‚Äôs lipgloss :/ It looks very pretty on my lips, but I don‚Äôt love the way it feels and don‚Äôt find it to be all that moisturizing or nourishing.",30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,GennySnail,This product definitely keeps my lips nourished and hydrated. It's just really sticky.,30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Very hydrating!,chatnee25,"This lip oil has easily become one of my favorites! I love how little and compact it is to take with me on the go and have it when needed. The oil looks awesome on my lips and leaves it shiny, nourished, and hydrated.",30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,abbyf23,"Makes my lips very hydrated, doesn‚Äôt have the best taste but not bad. It‚Äôs not super sticky either which is nice, you won‚Äôt feel like you have sticky lips but it will get caught in your hair lol. Received complimentary.",30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Nice cheer smell,Rubaska,"The best thing about this product is that it‚Äôs cruelty free and vegan. The texture feels pretty much the same as lip gloss. Although the color of the bottle appears to be  pink, it looks pretty much transparent on your lips. Has a nice cherry smell to it.",30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"Awesome, but Pricey IMO",C6d1w2k2,"I received this product for free in exchange for my review! I‚Äôd never used Fenty Skin products and was a little hesitant at first because I know sometimes celebrity skincare brands aren‚Äôt the best, but I must say I have been pleasantly surprised with this lip oil. It‚Äôs a thick consistency with a faint cherry smell. It keeps my lips moisturized all day - I‚Äôve started to carry it around with me everywhere! The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the price point. I wish it were cheaper, I feel $24 is a lot of money for something so tiny. Would absolutely buy it again if it were to go on sale though, I really like the product!",30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
a must have!,Sophieshumaker,this is one of the best lip products I have ever used! I love using it after my scrub or to start my day! it‚Äôs got a super cute and useful applicator that is perfect for my lips!,30 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!,Ndlz,"This is a nourishing, long lasting lip oil with a perfect amount of sheer tint. It has a very pleasant cherry smell which makes it even more amazing. It‚Äôs hydrating and makes my lips feel very soft without being sticky. It also has a pleasant cherry taste which I love. I‚Äôm really obsessed with this product and totally recommend it to everyone. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.",29 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Loved it,Mladic96,Love this so much! Better than the dior lip oil and cheaper! Smells amazing toooo! And left my lips so hydrated.,29 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,YungLaquifa,"I like this product a lot, it keeps my lips hydrated for much longer than your average chapstick. i wish the scent was a bit stronger though, as it fades quite quickly. I like the packaging as well, it feels a but luxurious.",29 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,cutcreasefreak,Extremely hydrating! Dries down beautifully! Comfortable on the lips and the smell is so yummy! Would definitely recommend this one!,29 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best Lipgloss I‚Äôve Wver Used,jaimsie,"This Cherry Treat Conditioning Lip Oil by Fenty is my all-time favorite lip gloss, and if you saw how many lipglosses I have, you‚Äôd think I was a loon! It‚Äôs all about the consistency and shine, and this one has the perfect texture and the shine is amazing. I love this one because it lasts and leaves my lips looking gorgeous for a long time.",29 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I love mine!,Noah606,This is the best lip oil I have ever tried! My lips feel so much smoother than they did before using this product. The lip oil goes on clear and gives my lips a nice refreshing feeling that helps to keep them moisturized and not dry and cracked. The ingredients in this lip oil is way better than my other lip product I had been using. I've been getting nice compliments on it too.,29 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Awesome,Qasim,"Looks and feels amazing, the texture is nice and it lasts a long time. It has a hint of cherry smell to it which is a nice touch. Definitely would buy again and recommend.",28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
love this product.. more of a lip loss than an oil,nasrin29,"I really like this lip ""oil"". I would say it has more of a thick lip gloss consistency though. It sticks nicely to my lips and coats them with a light shine. I like that it barely has a pigment, and leaves a very natural-looking pinkish color. I usually use glossier balm dot com to moisturize my lips, but I switched to using this instead and I do notice a few differences. It does not become oily and come off like balm dot com does, and it stays on for much longer. I also really love the applicator. It is wide and has a unique shape, allowing you to get the perfect amount of product on your lips. It is a good size to carry around and fits nicely into a bag. Conveniently sized. I also like the smell, it's not too overbearing but it's there. Also, I usually have an issue with biting/picking my lips when they are dry but this product has definitely prevented me from doing so because it keeps my lips soft and moisturized, and the sticky texture discourages me from messing with my lips. Overall, I love this lip oil! I am not sure if I would buy this product on my own because it is $24 for a little container of product. Not very price efficient, but if you like Fenty and are looking for a good lip product, I would recommend trying this. Oh also, the packaging is so cute!",28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great lip oil that stays,Jsparr,"The Fenty lip oil has a great consistency to it. It dries down a bit once applied and stays! It has one of the best applicators compared to other lip oils - it goes on evenly and provides coverage in one swipe. The cherry scent isn‚Äôt too strong, but it is present when you apply the lip oil. It‚Äôs a great lip treatment and I‚Äôm excited to try other scents/flavors.",28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Obsessed,Lisinetskaia,It smells so good! It looks amazing too! Very conditioning. I‚Äôm obsessed,28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Eh..Pass!,demamdthebest,"This lip oil is not worth the hype! There nothing this product does that you can‚Äôt find less expensively. 
The application is goopy. If you put this on before you go to bed for overnight treatment, you will get it on your sheets or pillowcase. 
It feels nice when you put it on as you sit watching tv and
You roll your lips together. It might as well be liquid chap-stick. 
Tue smell is temporary. There is no unpleasant taste. The packaging is cheap. 
Eh! Pass!",28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Dior Lip oil who?,grimizzy,"Why spend over 30$ for a lip oil when this does the exact same thing AND is conditioning? I usually was skeptical about lip oils until I received this one thinking it would not be any different than a gloss, The lip oil is so hydrating and thick without feeling sticky, such a beautiful universal tint. I am a fair skinned Hispanic & i tend to feel tints are too strong for my liking. This is my go-to Lippie now. Perfect for everyday wear. 10/10 would recommend!",28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Lip oil,MichelsotheLion,I‚Äôm strongly recommend this lip oil for everyone because it‚Äôs really good and it‚Äôs smells good,28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,cosmicaf,"I literally was so surprised with this. I got this as a sample to try, and omg. I'm in love. It's more of a sticky gloss than an oil, but that's what I love! It's long lasting and def acts like a lip balm in that it's pretty nourishing. I honestly wasn't expecting to be wow'd this much. It does have a cherry smell to it but nothing over powering, at least not to be. I'll def buy this on my own when I run out.",28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,JO171,Absolutely Amazing! Rihanna and team have once again bought us an amazing product. This is my first time trying lip oils and it id fantastic. Leaves your lips feeling revitalized and conditioned. The scent is to die for my fianc√©e loves it. 10/10,28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Works for me,chicagomom50,"For me, I have tried several lip conditioners‚Ä¶. They either work great or make my lips more dry! This one, is perfect for me.  I think it‚Äôs the best one I have tried.

Super yummy and hydrating!,mazie98,"I received this in exchange for an honest review. First off the packaging is aesthetically pleasing. The cherry scent isn‚Äôt nauseating like most tend to be which i was pleasantly surprised by! The formula is long lasting, shiny, and very hydrating. I only need to reapply every 5 or so hours which is super convenient for a lip gloss :)",28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

HYDRATING!,Glamylaa,Loveee it. Perfect hydration on the lips. It gives a tiniest amount of tint to the lips. Lasts a good while too,28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Juicy lips,xxomark,Juicy hydration on the lips. Perfect amount of sheer tint to the lips that adds hydration and beauty into one product. Easy to take on the go with you. Has the nice applicator that is unique in my opinion. I love the scent it has and the long sensation on having my lips hydrated.,28 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
this lipgloss is poppin‚Äô!,okjeanbean,"Love this lip oil! I received this cherry treat lip oil complimentary in exchange for my honest review. It‚Äôs super hydrating, left my lips feeling nourished for a few hours and didn‚Äôt leave my lips feeling sticky. The taste/smell is pleasantly cherry, not overwhelmingly scented. The color is super natural, just a cute light wash of pink, which I love! Overall would totally recommend :)",27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,cupcakes786,"this lip oil contains sweet cherry seed oil, barbados cherry + wild cherry extracts, jojoba seed & rosehip fruit oils! 

this was one of my first times trying out a lil oil and I really liked it! my first impressions were definitely not the best as I thought the lip oil was sticky and felt like a lipgloss but, the more I wore this, the more it felt like an oil! it feels so moisturizing and makes my lips nice and shiney while instantly softening my lips. it has a childhood cherry chapstick scent to it kind of like those kiddie lip glosses I used to own as a child,  not my fave but it‚Äôs alright. I was NOT impressed with the packaging as it gave off dollar store vibes which for $24 is just not right. once you took the doe foot applicator out(which I love), you can also see how the lip oil comes less than halfway full, I really really wish it didn‚Äôt come with such less product because I really do like it overall, while the packaging and quantity you get is unfair, the lip oil feels VERY nice on the lips, especially if you‚Äôre prone to having dry lips (aka me). pick it up if you‚Äôre willing to spend $24 on it because it‚Äôs definitely worth the hype!",27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

LOVE IT,LindaBatsh,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! I received this as a complimentary sample and I am super grateful that I did. It like a little magic gloss in the cutest bottle. I love the simple yummy cherry smell, I love it‚Äôs light sticky feel, I love the texture, I love the way it actually conditions my lips and makes them feel super hydrated and soft. It last on forever I think I only reapply it after I eat. The bottle is super cute and the applicator is thick and perfect for a single coat. I literally love everything about it. I have a natural lip color so I just apply it on top for that glossy finish. Every time  I use it I literally fall in love with it even more. I would definitely recommend and would buy again for myself!! It‚Äôs become my favorite gloss I have ever tried so far‚Ä¶ and knowing that it‚Äôs also conditioning my lips makes it my number one favorite!",27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

"It's poppin,‚Äô it's poppin‚Äô",claras16,"This lip oil is pretty awesome! I love how moisturizing it is, it doesn‚Äôt just provide a protective barrier that wears off, but actually conditions your lips. When I read ‚Äúlip oil‚Äù I was expecting something with more of an oily texture, but this definitely feels more like a classic lip gloss‚Ä¶some kind of runny gel emulsion. I‚Äôm cool with that though and have no complaints.",27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Wow!,Bamabosslady,This is hands down he best lip oil I have ever used! It keeps my lips moist and supple especially during these hot summer months!,27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Beautiful!!,BeautyInc,"The first thing I noticed about this product is the scent. I absolutely love it, and I usually really hate cherry scented products but this one is so light and fruity. The applicator is really big and fluffy and it‚Äôs not drying on my lips like other products. My lips get a beautiful gloss to it, it looks great alone or paired over any lipstick. I would definitely buy this on my own once it empties. It‚Äôs not super expensive when you compare it to other lip oils, plus it‚Äôs worth the money in my opinion because the product is just that good. I would 100% recommend this to anyone who wants to try lip oils.",27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,KaleySH,"I really like this lip oil, it feels very smooth and I like how shiny it makes my lips look. The only thing is that I wish it gave off more color and was more pigmented. It‚Äôs basically just a clear gloss, which I don‚Äôt think is worth the price point.",27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Another great Fenty product!!,MelMilWil,I love a good lip gloss but especially with lip oil to strengthen and condition. This photo is taken on a naked lip but I usually wear it over a lip liner to provide color and shine. Leaves my lips feeling great!,27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Thick Gloss,inessachka25,I do like the consistency of the oil which is slightly thicker than most glosses. It does last quite long on the lips. I also like how it doesn‚Äôt leave much red pigmentation to the lips how some colored glosses might. The only thing is that price could be the determining factor depending on the person.,27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Non-sticky lip hydration oil,AlexandraM96,This product is so perfect for my dry and chappy lips. It has a hint of cherry and provides long lasting hydration.

Top quality Lip oil,marieLov,"This is a great cherry lip oil. Smells just like real cherries. Made my lips feel hydrated and smooth.

Love,Riricici,I love the Fenty Skin Lip treatment! The applicator is super fluffy and smooth on the lips! It adds a bit of a tint to your lips and almost reminds me of the laniege one.

Lovely hydrator,ChelseaErinne,Love this! I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect texture wise because I‚Äôve never used a lip oil but it‚Äôs neat. It‚Äôs almost like a slick balm. It smells very sweet and of course like cherries. It hydrates for a good amount of time. I really like the wider applicator on this and think overall it‚Äôs a win.,27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,JackIsaac,Honestly this exceeded expectations. It's the perfect thickness to stay on the lips with a nice amount of gloss and flavor without veering into the Lil Mama Lip Gloss territory. My lips felt hydrated for hours after application.,27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Love it!!,ari1428,"Although this feels like more of a gloss than an oil, I love the fact that it slightly dries down because I feel like my lips are absorbing the key ingredients in this product. I‚Äôm a long time victim of dry lips and I absolutely love this product, I really felt as though it moisturized my lips because I wasn‚Äôt feeling the need to ever lick my lips or reapply throughout the day! The applicator is super cute and the cherry scent is also super nice! 10/10 would recommend",27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,JeffnSambry,"It‚Äôs a good oil/gloss non sticky and stays for a while in your lips until it‚Äôs absorb, smells good, it doesn‚Äôt give you color, just a hint but not noticeable enough, so it‚Äôs mostly a treatment, helps a lot with dry lips, think about a lip balm but in oil lol",27 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Smells good-needs to be bigger for the price,vanillaskyy,"I didn't receive free product like a lot of these fake reviews have. I love this lip oil. It smells good. It is thick but not sticky on and lasts for a while but not too long a time on. I took off 1 star because for the price, it needs to be the size of her glosses. Also not a fan of dimethicone in so many products. Would repurchase.",26 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

BUY THIS!,Beverbe,"The best lip oil period. I‚Äôm one of those people that‚Äôs addicted to ‚Äúlip chap‚Äù lol. I apply it all day. I‚Äôve tried every single one. THIS IS THE ONE. Omg. I actually forget to apply more throughout the day because I don‚Äôt need it. I‚Äôve been using it for a week and already see a huge improvement in my lips. I‚Äôve been using Stacks hydrating lip peel for awhile now and felt like it stopped working after awhile. After using this for a few days I could feel the dead skin coming off. I exfoliate every couple days and my lips have gotten considerably lighter and fuller. So it‚Äôs both a great moisturizer and seems to do what it says it will. I definitely notice the skin barrier on my lips getting stronger. It feels like it clings to your lips. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but I love it.",26 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Awesome Lip Oil and Great Scent,Paris48291,"This has a very nice, tame cherry scent. It smells like real cherries and not artificial. The oil really helped soothe and moisturize my lips. This lip oil is similar to a lip gloss due to its shine. When applying, the gloss shine lasts a very long time, which I have never seen before when it comes to any type of lip oil gloss. I really liked that feature. However, after a while of applying the product, the lip oil becomes very sticky on my lips.",26 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

,kaylado,I love this product! My lips are always dry this is the first product that made them super soft. The color is more natural on the lip than in the bottle and sweet cherry scent.

I will recommend this to my friend!,25 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

luxury for your lips ‚ô•Ô∏é,djreviews,"This lip oil smells nice, but not too sweet. I find the product to be on par with high end makeup (such as lancome or mac). The oil goes on super smooth like a gloss, and I was happy to find the overly glossy look didn‚Äôt last more than a 1/2 hour. After that, it feels like it melts into your lips and continues to condition them for a couple of hours. So that makes this way more effective than your average lip balm to me. It also is more nourishing than a gloss. I have SUPER chapped lips all year round, and my lips have felt legitmately smoother since use. Only thing is it doesn‚Äôt seem like that much product for the price, but I don‚Äôt know how long the bottle will last me. pic 1 is of my lips no product. pic 2 is with fenty cherry treat lip oil.",24 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,PatrickG,"I received this product as part of a free sample program. This lip oil is amazing. First off, the packaging is so good. Really easy to open and carry. it‚Äôs smell is so pungent and screams cherry which is great. It really moisturizes the lips and leaves lips really smooth and supple. Wonderful product!",24 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Kissable soft lips,lbritsky,"This lip oil feels SO GOOD on the lips, I honestly thought it was going to be like an actual oil. But it feels so smooth on the lips, and the cherry scent smells good too!",24 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
My go-to,hernandezsl,"My new everyday go to lip oil! It's very hydrating, lasts a long time, leaves my lips hydrated, and it has a nice cherry scent. I wear this instead of chapstick now and it does an amazing job at keeping my lips hydrated.",24 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Fenty Cherry Lip Oil!,EmmieVerhaagh,"I was very excited to receive this product from bzzagent for my honest review. This lip oil has a great look to the packaging and bottle. It is clean and easy to apply with the soft doe footed wand. It was a bit stickier than other lip oils I have used, attracting hair and other stuff. The cherry flavor is very pleasant and has a great sweet smell. Overall this is a very moisturizing and leaves your lips looking and feeling moisturized. This product is also very affordable and I would most definitely purchase this product again!",24 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Get if you want long lasting soft lips,CatHan,"I continue to be impressed by Fenty Skin‚Äôs newest products. I didn‚Äôt think it was possible to love RiRi even more than I already do?!‚Äî but here we are. 
The queen has blessed us with this lip oil and it is in fact a treat. If you have dry and dehydrated lips like mine that are on the rough side and have pronounced lips lines no matter how much u exfoliate n hydrate but are still somehow always dry, get this this lip oil! It conditions, moisturizes, softens and absorbs VERY well and long lasting! I‚Äôm talking even after light eating/drinking‚Äî Super impressed that I didn‚Äôt have to reapply right after. 
Performance & overall quality alone makes it worth buying. It‚Äôs comparable to some higher end lip oils I‚Äôve tried as well.",24 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Wanted to love this but‚Ä¶,ChrissyJayG,"I love the smell of cherries and I love a good lip oil but this one misses the mark.  It‚Äôs very thick and sticky feeling on the lips.  Feels more like a thick lip gloss to me.  If you want a non-sticky lip oil, try Charlotte Tilbury‚Äôs magic lip oil.  The downside to that one is it‚Äôs expensive for a small amount of product but it really is much, much nicer feeling and conditioning than this goopy gloss",24 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
wow girls I recommend it I have tried it and it is,abigailAl,wow girls I recommend it I have tried it and it is very good even my family has tried it and they loved it they liked it a lot,24 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,PostsByYas,Rihanna did her THANG with this lip oil treatment. My lips have never EVER felt so refreshed and plump! The pigment is absolutely perfect. It isn‚Äôt too sticky and you don‚Äôt need a lot of product. Also doesn‚Äôt dry out easily or fast.,24 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I recommend it,kellyescu27,"An excellent product, of good quality. The moment you apply it to the lips you can feel the hydration, with a very pleasant aroma and an exceptional shine. Without a doubt, it is a product that I will buy and recommend to my friends. Thanks to Bzzagente and Sephora for giving me the opportunity to participate in this campaign.",23 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing. Lips for days!,FranVF,My lips feel so nice! It looks great and smells great. It feels so luxurious just using it. It's clearly a high quality product and I'm a little surprise it doesn't go for more than that. It's definitely a treat for your lips. Makes them feel nice and moisturized for quite a while. I love it! I highly recommend it as an alternative to lip balm and for healthy-looking lips.,23 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
LOVE,anamarie18,I love this lip oil! This reminds of me the Dior one because it has the same applicator and feel. This makes my lips feel hydrated and soft. It also smells really good! It is very easy to apply and it applies on smoothly. It is also nice to know this is a vegan and cruelty free product and is good for dry skin! I will wear this a lot this summer! I totally recommend this to family and friends!,23 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Pretty Bomb,audreyfister,"Great product! It‚Äôs not super moisturizing, but the oil makes your lips look great and has a gorgeous tint. Fenty products in general have been great for me and my skin, and this applies too. After receiving this product as a free sample, I do think I would buy it again. It‚Äôs quick and easy to apply and a great thing to have in your bag",23 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,veewiin,I‚Äôve tried so many lip oils and this is my fave‚Ä¶ even above the Dior lip oil! IMO it lasts longer and also doesn‚Äôt leave my lips flaky after. I typically only use aquafor and now I have this!,23 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Cherry - tastic,AliRo2,I think this product is so great especially for the summer season coming up. It is truly conditioning and I love the pleasant cherry smell that it projects. It‚Äôs a great touch to a simple makeup look and lasts for a considerable amount of time.,22 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Will not disappoint,ShannyS86,"Have tried many lip oils in the past‚Ä¶our girl does it again! Hydrates, makes lips look healthy and full. Will repurchase.",22 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Lips feel so silky smooth,,I'm loving this amazing cherry conditioning oil.  My lips feel very hydrated and look glossy. It's a grown up version of shine that looks professional and feels silky.  It smells great and I love that it's made out of healthy ingredients that are good for me.  The applicator is easy to use and the tube looks super cute in my makeup bag.  I take this with me everywhere I go because it really makes my lips feel great.,22 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Cherry-rific!,pinkvenom626,"I LOVE this Fenty Beauty lip oil! My lips feel amazing after using it! The packaging is adorable. Applicator is perfect for hugging the lips and coating them perfectly! My lips are extremely moisturized after application and smell delicious! Aaaaah‚Ä¶. Cherries. Not only does the lip oil smell like cherries, but it is made with three different types of cherry extracts. It is not often that something is scented and actually made with non-artificial ingredients to obtain that smell. I even let my husband try the lip oil; and he approved of it as well. It makes the lips very kissable. ;) Overall, I really enjoyed this lip oil from Fenty Beauty. My reviews are 100% honest as always no matter if it is bought or gifted! Thanks for reading!",22 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great!,siarh,"I love this great lip mask! It is a perfect combo: it hydrates lips and gives the perfect glow! I love that it's not sticky at all, with a perfect color that is not too bright, almost transparent, but so cool!! Recommend it!",22 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best lip oil I‚Äôve ever tried!,JanetHearts,"This lip oil is amazing! The most long lasting one I‚Äôve used‚Äîit lasts for a couple hours (even after eating and drinking). It goes on clear and is thick and luxurious feeling, without being too sticky. It doesn‚Äôt dry out my lips like other glosses and oils I‚Äôve tried. The smell is incredible too. I have nothing bad to say about it other than I wish it came in a bigger size.",22 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,SarahKLiv,The best lip I‚Äôll I have ever tried! Highly recommend to all who love a glossy look! Another best part about it is it smells AMAZING!,22 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Delicious,tyedyedress,I love love love this Cherry Treat Conditioning+Strengthening Lip Oil!!!! From the brush applicator that is so soft and professional to the way it hydrates my lips and the amazing smell.,22 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs a lip gloss.,MariHammies,I was excited to try this out because I‚Äôve been needing a good moisturizing lip oil however this feels more like a gloss. It‚Äôs advertised as non sticky but It definitely is. If it were advertised as a sheer gloss I‚Äôd be happy because it does give a cute red sheen to your lips and the cherry scent is amazing. Also my lips felt just as dry if not worse after the product was gone. I love it just not as a lip oil.,22 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I love itttt,cherrybombbabe,"I love this lip oil!! it doesn‚Äôt get crusty, fragrance is nice, the applicator is super plush and the oil is luxurious feeling and honestly if this had the ph thing to make your lips pink it would be the best lip oil ever",22 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

I‚Äôm in love,AlwaysGorgeous,I really like this lip oil it smells amazing and it moisturize your lips all day i love it,21 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,jewliajellyb,"This is super moisturizing without feeling sticky, which I love. It's also a really pretty gloss-- it's pretty clear with a light pink tinge. I took off one star because the cherry smell is very strong and very artificial-- like a piece of candy. I wish it was less strong or at least a little more realistic, because it throws me off of what is otherwise a very good product.",21 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Amiramya,This lip oil is really nice! It smells and tastes yummy amd feels nice on the lips. It isnt sticky and moisturizes really well. It is a bit pricy for what it is but i enjoy it.,21 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great nourishing lip oil,hannahlaxton,Amazing lip oil! Smells great and sinks into the lips quickly. Leaves your lips hydrated and glossy!,21 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,ashmca,"Head over HEELS in love with this lip oil!! Fenty continues to make EXCELLENT products! I really haven‚Äôt been disappointed yet- the quality is 10/10. The wand is HUGE & so so soft- the oil itself is the perfect consistency I need! Not too oily, not sticky- just perfectly hydrating. Leaves a light tint. I LOVE this lip oil! Highly recommend!",21 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,lorenlee,"This is a super nice lip oil, non sticky and lasts for quite some time. The scent reminds me of strawberry smuckers, It‚Äôs so nostalgic. The only thing I have a slight issue with is that if I use it a couple times throughout the day, my lip will ever so slightly peel but that happens to my lips with any product I use on them so far. So I don‚Äôt forsee that being the case with everyone who uses this product. I definitely recommend!",21 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Soothed my Sunburned Lips,theajan,"I‚Äôve been using this for a week now and have noticed that my lips do seem softer and more hydrated. The smell is good and not overpowering, which is a huge benefit in my opinion. As advertised, it‚Äôs not sticky and the applicator makes it easy to apply. 
And a another benefit is that it‚Äôs helped heal my lips after I stayed in the sun too long and forgot to apply an SPF chapstick. Usually my lips hurt for a day or 2 and I applied it immediately as I started to feel pain and had relief within an hour. Would definitely recommend to a friend.",21 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Not Long Lasting,karakay83,I received this Conditoning Lip Oil from Fenty Beauty and BzzAgent for free for my thoughts. The packaging is adorable with being small and having cherries on it. It actually smells like cherries too. It feels very hydrating on the lips. As soon as you apply it you can feel the moisturizing. Your lips even looks nicely glossed too. My only complaint is it doesn‚Äôt last long. The lip oil fades away within a couple hours.,21 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,alexiskom,Love this lip oil!! Not sticky at all and lasts a long time. I only had to apply twice within 8 hours. LOVE the applicator shape and size. 10/10.,21 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Easy and wears nice,bubblebuzz,"Smells so good and stays on well. More like in between a gloss and oil, but I honestly love it. Super cute too and easy to toss in your bag.",20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Cozypeach,I like how this lip oil is non-sticky yet moisturizing compared to other formulas. It‚Äôs very hydrating and leaves a slight cherry toned tint! The shine is nearly incomparable and I would definitely buy this and recommend to anyone with dry lips/in need of a shiny gloss.,20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,manwithaplan1,I like to wear chapstick at night and during the day for my lips. This is a lot more shiny than I am used to and so I will probably only use this at night. I like that it isn‚Äôt sticky and still feels really nice.,20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,cheryl,I love the way it feels on my lips.  I‚Äôm enjoying it a lot!,20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Must have,zaria193944,Amazing lip oil; it smells divine and it is so moisturizing,20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Johnbl123,I like this lip treatment it works well and isn't sticky.,20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,NubianNia,I love this. I apply it after I use the Fenty lip scrub. It keeps my lips moisturized all day.,20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great conditioning lip product,alycub,"This product performs probably the best out of all my lip oils I have. It feels weightless and not very sticky on the lips and you really don‚Äôt notice it on too much, my lips feel conditioned even after it dries eventually and that‚Äôs something I struggle with finding in other lip oils. I would buy this and recommend buying this product especially if you struggle with dry peeling lips.",20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
It's fine,JustNatsu13,"I like this product but there isn't a lot of it and I don't think it's worth the price. It's nice, it works, it smells good but not overpowering but it isn't the most long lasting lip treatment I've tried and it isn't the best working lip treatment I have tried. The applicator is a little large for the opening so I have to dip in and out a couple of times to get the amount of product that I want. The applicator is an interesting shape that works well. I wish that there was either more product or that this was a cheeper product, I just wouldn't buy it full price because I do not think it's worth it.",20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
A perfect glow without a sticky feeling.,IZA0,"I received this product as a free sample. The reason why I accept this product is because I love free things, but the truth is that I was not very excited about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreceiving this product because I thought it would be the same as a lip gloss and I do not like lip gloss, they are very sticky, I don't like their texture, and when they dry they feel weird.
I didn't know the difference between a lip gloss and a lip oil. But to my surprise, I liked this lip oil. The texture is not sticky. My lips feel soft. It is better than using lip balm, because lip balm dries very fast, and this lip oil can last for a long time on my lips. It is very moisturizing. It adds a nice glow to my lips, and it has the advantage that it doesn't have a color, so I can use it over a lipstick or tint and add some color to my lips with a bit of glow.
I really liked having tried this product, definitely I will use it on a daily basis.
Is there something I didn't like about this product? Yes. I expected that being cherries would have a small aroma to them, but it was not like that, it is not a big deal, but I do think that I should comment on it.",20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Chasegp522,"i do really like this lip oil, it feels nice on the lips. it smells really good as well but there are some down sides. i think for the amount of product your getting $31 is a lil much i don‚Äôt think i will be repurchasing maybe if it was a lil less yes but i do like it just not enough to repurchase",20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
cute & works well,jazzy08j,"The packaging for this product is very cute and small. As for the lip oil itself, it does have a slight smell of cherry that isn‚Äôt too strong. It is a little thick which makes it feel like a lip gloss but it is probably why it lasts so long. My lips do feel really moisturized after it dries so I would recommend it to people who have dry lips.",20 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
more like a gloss than an oil,diorglosss,"the lip oil is okay, it‚Äôs definitely not the best. it‚Äôs more of a gloss than an actual lip oil it‚Äôs very thick. i do feel like because it‚Äôs so thick it last a long time. you can eat and still feel it on after you‚Äôre done. it‚Äôs not super moisturizing either. i don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything special about. it‚Äôs also tiny, definitely the smallest lip oil out of all of the really popular ones right now. i‚Äôm going to continue to use it because it works just fine but i don‚Äôt think id repurchase it. first thing i didn‚Äôt love from fenty :(",19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,briewatson,"I really love the applicator, it makes it super easy to apply. The cherry scent and packaging is adorable! The formula isn‚Äôt sticky at all, and It‚Äôs not extremely nourishing-but I do feel more moisturized after using. It leaves a nice gloss on the lips.",19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Just okay.,clarexc,"I received this for free thanks to BZZAgent. Overall, the lip oil smells really nice, like a sweet cherry. Definitely not a very strong flavor though. It‚Äôs a pretty thick formula but I don‚Äôt find it to be moisturizing. There‚Äôs a VERY light pinkish red tint to it as well. I expect this to be really great but it was just okay. I don‚Äôt think it is worth $24.",19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love this!,Iriazz,I love this so much! I‚Äôve been using this for a few days now and my lips are so soft. The smell is very sweet. I also really like that it‚Äôs not that sticky. The color so cute. I think the only thing I wish was that it was much bigger for the price. It‚Äôs a very small product. Especially since it‚Äôs $25. I really like the applicator. It‚Äôs fat and much easier to apply to the lips.,19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Good for photography,katederg,"This lipstick is a bit steaky,but moisturize at the same time.I can‚Äôt say it last for long as usually lipstick does but for video shoot or photo shoot is perfect!!!",19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs a decent product,Kensdoll,"The packaging and the wand are really nice. I love the texture of the product. It is more like a clear lip gloss than a lip oil. Very light scent, has no taste which is quite disappointing. My lips are still dry after using this",19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Loveee,mskimona,"I love this lip oil, it is so moisturizing plus it smells so good like cherry! I like the applicator on it as well. I definitely will purchase after I finish this one. Recommend!",19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great flavor and consistency,Animalgirl27,The best lip oil I‚Äôve ever had. Just got it and I‚Äôm obsessed. Better than the Dior lip oil by FAR. This is a great product. It has the perfect consistency and is not sticky or heavy. It lasts all day. It has a subtle cherry flavor with a small applicator. I have dry lips and this feels so hydrating. My lips look so nice with it on and after. I wish it came in a bigger option. I definitely recommend.,19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Beautiful,jill00333,The lip oil so nurishing and has a little tint to it. I love how it feels on the lips. I have to reapply like any other lip balm and oils but this feels better than most. It has a thick consistency which makes a nice coat on the lips and feels super hydrating,19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I love it,wmq162,"Smells awesome, makes my lips really really soft. I would definitely recommend this product and I would buy it again. I love how it makes my lips feel and look!",19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
just buy!,foxyjb,"Iam loving this lip oil! The texture is non sticky , has amazing ingredients and give such a nice simple glow. I notice when I use at night, in the morning my lips was soft and very hydrated. We always care about skin care and forget about the importance of lip care at times. This will be a great addition to your overall skin care needs. The price range is perfect because you don‚Äôt need that much. Just buy!  This product was gifted but the love is all mine.",19 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
best lip oil out there??!!,jasminebbeauty,"YALL!! this is amazing!! this is i think the perfect lip oil for the average consumer. i know for me personally, i love a thicker lip product but i know most people prefer a thinner consistency, so that‚Äôs why i made that comment. the consistency is between the clarins lip oil and the dior one. it does have a pretty strong scent though so if you don‚Äôt like that, you may not love this one. the applicator is also pretty similar to the dior and clarins one. it also leaves more of a glossy look which again, for me personally, i love. i LOVE this lip oil so much!! definitely throwing in my bag immediately to have with me all the time.",18 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Worth it !,XxAnna,"Love this product how it feels and makes my lips so soft, smells good too. Wish there was more product",18 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
best lip oil!,Lesliec11,This lip oil feels incredible on the lips. It feels like a lip mask. It looks beautiful! I can see myself using this by itself or over a lip liner. It makes my lips feel so hydrated especially since I have dry lips. I love it! I honestly think this might be the best lip oil I‚Äôve tried.,18 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
you need it,scgoodman92,Not sticky at all & perfect consistency that feels moisturizing and protective. 100/10,18 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Fenty cherry treat lip oil,Mrreviewer,"I got Fenty Skin Cherry Treat conditioning + Strengthening Lip Oil free from BzzAgent I gave this one to my 23 year old sister to try, here‚Äôs her thoughts. It has the same applicator as Dior lip oil, however can tell a slight difference in the quality of the product. The benefits of owning this Fenty brand lip oil is that it doesn‚Äôt dry down, and it conditions your lips, leaving behind a beautiful slight pink tint. You can use this to top lip liner or lipstick for glossy look. My sister owns many different Fenty products, she was very happy to add this one to her collection. So it‚Äôs safe to say she definitely would recommend, and as her brother what makes sister happy makes me happy.",18 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
5 stars all around!,JMT370,"Seriously hydrating, seriously delicious. Works better than most other lip balms, with a lovely cherry scent. Long lasting and really keeps your lips looking and feeling soft, healthy, and lucious.",18 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

Not a Lip ‚ÄúOil‚Äù,trecks,"Due to an injury, my lower lip gets dried out very easily, and lip oils and moisturizers have been my saving grace. When I saw fenty had come out with one, I got so exited and purchased it immediately. This is a lip gloss. It‚Äôs extremely sticky and doesn‚Äôt really moisturize your lips in any meaningful way. It‚Äôs be fine if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, but if you‚Äôre expecting a lip oil, look elsewhere.",18 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,cathees,"I got this product from BzzAgent, and I have to say that this is probably one of my favorite lip products. I use to use the Burts Bees lip oil, but that would dry out my lips. Because of the heat, my lips got really dry and cracked, but after one use of this product, I can see that there's already a big difference in the softness of my lips and my lips are more hydrated. The product also smells really good. I think I will purchase this after my tube runs out.",18 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
like it,staciee69,"Makes your lips look so plump and juicy, it‚Äôs the perfect hint of color. Makes your lips look better and alive. Only bad thing is that it‚Äôs drying. Made my lips peel.

Yes yes yes,myyrraa,First when you open it it smells so good. Them the applicator is so cute and the lip oil glides on so smooth omg I‚Äôm obsessed definitely buying again,18 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
A new must have,Pistachi0,Tastes wonderful and nourishes lips. Tastes like a cherry candy and the flavor lasts awhile.

Very shiny and my lips looked much nicer after a couple days of wear.,17 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

My lips are frequently dry and have greatly benefited from this lip oil. I am new to lip oil and so happy about the results. The cherry scent is subtle which is great!,17 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Smells amazing!,Chihirol,"When I received the Fenty Skin Cherry Treat Conditioning & Strengthening Lip Oil to try out, I was a little nervous. I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with lip oils, and I don‚Äôt really like lip gloss, as it‚Äôs usually too sticky for me. However, I really like this!! First of all, it smells incredible, like cherry pie. It does make your lips really soft with a nice sheen. I would recommend this for sure and look forward to trying other Fenty Skin products!",17 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
My new favorite lip product!,elanasun,I have never used a lip oil before but I literally cannot stop using this stuff it smells amazing and makes my lips look so juicy and delicious!,17 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
The perfect summer gloss,micaela013198,This is the first time I've tried any Fenty Skin products and I was not disappointed. This is the perfect gloss for summer. I try to keep my makeup minimal and this gloss gives just a hint of color and shine. The applicator is way different than any gloss I've ever used before. It has a big plush applicator that makes it so easy to dab it onto your lips. This gloss isn't sticky which I love. The cherry scent is subtle and sweet.  To say I'm in love with this gloss would be an understatement. I will definitely be buying more.,17 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes

The Best!,Trini254,"It is thick, very moisturising and not sticky at all. I first used it right before bed, I woke up and it was still on my lips. I am someone who always has lip balm with them and uses it multiple times a day. This oil is so amazing and that didn‚Äôt touch my regular lip balm until noon. I will be stocking up as soon as it is available",17 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Jalyeewaylee,Im usually obsessed with everything fenty like i raveee and tell everyone about it. However this product is not one of them. I was expecting more. If you love the dior lip glow oil this is not a dupe. It is very long lasting but also feels very kiddy like children makeup. My mom compared it too cheap kitchen oil. Love the brand this one isnt it for me.,17 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,RosaLF,"The absolute best lip oil I have ever used! My lips usually get super dry in the summer very fast, this has helped so much. My lips feel amazing now.",17 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,ionn,"I was very excited about this lip oil. At first it‚Äôs smells amazing, super delicious cherry flavored. I like the applicator, reminds me of Dior lip oil, very easy to apply. The gloss is good to hydrate and gives beautiful glow to your lips",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
wouldnt reccomend its over hyped,aliciaruggiero1,honestly its alright.. would not repurchase its too expensive for the amount you get. doesnt feel nourshing at all and the applicators huge shoppers lip oils are the same for a fraction of price,16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
In love!,heartsnkim,"Just got it in the mail and LOVE how this smells. It's not
sticky at all and feels super hydrating on my lips! I just adore
how the packaging looks but it feels amazing on the lips.",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
In love,Ruthymardel,"I loved the product, it's like a transparent and moisturizing lip gloss and it smells delicious of cherry, it feels soft on the lips. And the packaging is compact so it is easy to carry because it does not take up much space. I recommend it.",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Just Buy It!,Candythek,"I just received it in the mail and I am blown away, my lips were super chapped before I put it on, one hour after application they were smooth supple and no longer peeling. The smell is delectable and there is no funny taste. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the applicator it‚Äôs immaculate. All in all just get it.",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,Larissa0792,"Love! Love! Love! Looks so pretty, amazing smell, and great applicator.",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing,mariam19,I received this as a sample from BzzAgent And I really really like it,16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
BEST LIP OIL EVER,Lacey1234,"RiRi went off with this one!!! First of all the packaging is SO cute and the applicator is the best thing EVER. Don‚Äôt even get me started on how AMAZING the scent is. It smells so good and is really soft, even my husband loves it. The finish is glossy but not sticky at all. Provided all day moisture. My new go to for day and night. Thank you Fenty!!!!",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love it,atk21,"I loved this lip oil, it instantly felt hydrating and moisturizing in my lips. Made my lips feel soft and velvety. It‚Äôs also long lasting so it didn‚Äôt make them feel dry and chapped",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,VioletGee,"This product works for what it was intended for, to condition your lips. I got this a few days ago and have used it at the end of the day when I get home and I find that it leaves my lips super soft until morning even and my lips have actually looked better since using it. 
I do wish it was more cherry scented than it is though. it's giving me blue raspberry candy (my personal favorite) not cherry. 
It's very subtle on the lips too it's not overly glossy, only when first applying it. Then it's more subtle which I like",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Great,Shoorima,"I would say that I have mixed feelings about this product, The packaging and presentation is nice. The scent inside is a bit too strong for my own personal taste. I has hoping for a bit of cherry, not a bomb of strong scent. All that aside, it applies nicely and evenly. Looks great on the lips and keeps me looking luscious for several hours.",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!,ChanceOfRainey,I love this lip oil so much! I just got it yesterday and since then I have been obsessed! It left my lips feeling amazing and hydrated! Honestly this is a really amazing oil compared to some of the other ones I've tried. 10/10 would recommend!,16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
LOVE IT!,zahra15,"It gives such a glossy shine to the lips and can be worn alone, under lipstick or on top of lipstick to protect the lips against dryness and cracking. The lip oil looks amazing when you‚Äôve got it on, it‚Äôs very hydrating and stays on your lips which I truly love!",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Love at first swipe,lailasurangel,"The perfect thickness, so comfortable and juicy! And the hint of red is perfect to give your lips just a little something. The ultimate no makeup makeup lip oil

Rihanna has done it again!",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
best lip product,jawharahaddad,Loveeeeeeee this it goes on like a lip gloss but once it‚Äôs on it‚Äôs super moisturizing will buy again,16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,tillman366,"I really thought this was going to be an amazing lip oil because it's Fenty; unfortunately, it was a huge fail. It is so thick/sticky, that doesn't condition or cushion the lips. The smell is a cheap artificial cherry (think kids' makeup). The only thing going for this lip oil is the name and the doe-foot applicator.",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
MUST HAVE,kalistawalters,This lip oil is the most conditioning product on the market. The scent is very bearable and not overwhelming. For those who know what a sticky gloss is like this is not a sticky product at all. It is a thicker lip oil. Hence the very moisturizing and conditioning effects. This is my new go to!,16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
,indiacharissee,"Love this ! It has a thick consistency and feels very nourishing. Has a slight cherry scent that I‚Äôm not really a fan of, but the scent doesn‚Äôt last so I am happy with that. Wore it over night as a lip treatment and woke up to nice nourished lips. Great job fenty !",16 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
not my favorite but not bad,glamchik,"When I want a lip oil, I truly want that thin non sticky consistency. I do like this lip oil, it has a nice cherry candy scent that isn‚Äôt too strong. This is for people who want a thicker lip oil/gloss. Slightly sticky but not bad. My hair did stick to my lips with it though. I‚Äôm still on the hunt for my go to lip oil. I might have to return this for the price since it‚Äôs not a love for me.",15 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
I‚Äôm obsessed,MissPerfect12,"Honestly I‚Äôm obsessed with this lip oil. It‚Äôs so nourishing my lips have never felt softer. It‚Äôs light enough that it doesn‚Äôt feel heavy or sticky, it‚Äôs the PERFECT consistency. Oh and the flavour is so light and not at all overpowering like some oils. I haven‚Äôt really been a fan of lip oils over the years but this one has me sold! The colour pay off is essentially sheer. If you have really pink lips it adds a bit of colour but I like that it‚Äôs mostly clear!!!",15 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
"No Color, Tastes Funny & Sticky",Pokeey,"This was a waste of money. Hardly any smell or tint, tastes funny and feels really sticky. I'm really disappointed! It did last a long time, but I'll likely never wear it. In contrast, I was really happy to discover the lip oil by Haus Labs, which was perfect for me! You win some and you lose some!",14 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
10/10 recommend!,withloveShanel,"Believe the reviews! I don‚Äôt own any other lip oils, but I am in love with this one. The cherry scent smells good and isn‚Äôt overwhelming. I absolutely love the wide doe foot applicator that picks up a good amount of product so you don‚Äôt have to double dip. This is perfect for the summer. Not sticky, perfect amount of gloss. You‚Äôll love it!",14 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best lip oil and fenty product !!,gigsab,"Oh my gosh this has got to be my ultimate favourite lip product now!! It‚Äôs like the perfect formula! Super comfortable not sticky not heavy. The color, taste and scent is all beautiful and not overpowering. My lips looked so luscious and even after 3 hours my lips feel like they have a balm on and feels super moisturized!! Absolutely loving it ! I‚Äôve tried the dior lip oil and the Laniege lip mask which was nice for a few mins but after awhile it was just meh. However this really is a cherry on top ;)",13 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
THE BEST,jadealycebod,Fenty never misses and this lip oil is an 1000000/10! Definitely recommend! It‚Äôs super glossy and feel amazing on the lips!,13 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
Best. Lip. Oil. Ever.,dangernakamoto,"The best lip oil I‚Äôve ever had. Just got it and I‚Äôm obsessed. Better than the Dior lip oil by FAR. Has the perfect consistency, not sticky and heavy just perfect but also it lasts all day. Best subtle cherry flavor and the cutest packaging. Also the applicator is so good and sturdy unlike others I‚Äôve had. So good and feels so hydrating. My lips look so nice with it on and after.",10 Jun 2022,Fenty Beauty,Lip,Yes
