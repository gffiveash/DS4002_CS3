"this is my first ever huda beauty product, and i like it a lot more than i thought i would! first, i got the baby pink color which i was worried would be too light for my skin, but it blends in very well. a little goes a long way! the packaging is very cute, applicator is great, and i definitely wasn’t expecting there to be a scent, but there is a slight sweet scent which i like. overall, very happy with my purchase (this is my first ever sephora review too, i liked it that much :D)",05 Feb 2025,pleasantly surprised!!,kookie12,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
All seasons color! It makes you look calm very bronzed yet works perfectly as a blush too a little red? But it has a really nice glow,05 Feb 2025,,klara123,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"I am so confused because this product has such amazing reviews but I found it dry and hard to blend which made it really blotchy, am I doing something wrong?!",04 Feb 2025,,MaryMus1,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"I absolutely love the color and finish. I agree that its easy to blend (at least this color is i haven’t tried another color).

"I recently tried the Huda Beauty Blush Filter, and I have to say—it’s a game-changer. The formula is super lightweight, blends effortlessly, and gives my skin that perfect soft-focus glow. A little goes a long way, so I had to be careful not to overdo it, but once I got the right amount, it looked incredibly natural and fresh. I love how buildable it is, making it easy to go from a subtle flush to a more intense pop of color. Plus, the micro-pearls give it that radiant, dewy finish without looking greasy. If you’re into that healthy, glowing skin vibe, this one’s definitely worth trying!",03 Feb 2025,Just love it,,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"The colour is absolutely stunning, gives the perfect sunkissed glow. This product blends like a dream - for someone who isn’t very ‘makeup forward’, I appreciate how easy this is to apply.

Absolutely loveeee this blush! The shade Strawberry Cream is so flattering. I use it almost every day now,31 Jan 2025,Amazing Blush!,,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"I ordered this color, and it’s beautiful! However, the applicator is almost dry when pulled out, and it takes 3-4 tries to get a tiny dot per cheek.

"You know, at 54, I was very nervous to try something so… beautiful…so lasting…so complimenting.  But here I am.  And yes, Huda outdid herself and created a shade which is not only stunning, but works I am in love.  Please do not make this a limited edition shade that goes away.

New favorite! Blurred effect and smells delicious. Has a lip gloss/powdery texture. Easy to blend. Love!,31 Jan 2025,New fav!,megamazing1988,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"Oooooh this color! Huda always seems to deliver some of my favorite products! The UBE - Blush Filter Cream is in an awesome vibrant lilac shade that I thought wouldn't work with my pale olive skin tone but it blended beautifully into a stunningly flattering shade. UBE - Blush Filter Cream uses buildable pigments with micro- pearls to help blur imperfections and create a ethereal glow. The texture is soft, creamy and so easy to apply as it melts right into the skin. I love how magical I feel wearing this super flattering, vibrant, unique yet still somewhat subtle shade! A word of caution, a little goes a long way and this is a buildable product so you can refine your perfect vibrancy.",30 Jan 2025,Perfectly unique and flattering color!,Ananael,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"I love the purple color and it smells good! However, I don’t find it to be as easy to blend as they claim. I feel like I have other blushes that blend easier than this one, so I’m knocking off a star for that.",30 Jan 2025,"Great color, questionable blendability",eewelsh04,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"After using this product in the past few weeks, I have found that I love it. It is easy to use on my skin",29 Jan 2025,A favorite now,Aliciafer,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
So happy with this blush. Does exactly what it says and lasts on your skin. I already purchased two other shades prior to this new shade because I loved them. You can use two complimentary shades together for even more looks.,29 Jan 2025,Amazing Product!,sless,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"NOOoOoo! I wanted to like this so bad, the color is a beautiful burnt cherry. It swatched pretty nice in store, but I immediately had blending issues when I applied to my face. It looks very blotchy and patchy on my skin, I tried a sponge and brush and it just does not work. Unfortunately returning!",29 Jan 2025,Blotchy but beautiful- shame! 🥵,effiesays,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
This liquid blush is such a fun shade and I just love the feel of it on my skin. It’s such an easy application and it blends out so well too. I just love that it’s such a fun color this time around. So unique and so cool.,29 Jan 2025,Such a Unique Color,AmandaVoss,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
I actually have this blush in both the Ube and Strawberry shades and love them! They deliver when it comes to long lasting blurring color. I typically use the Ube and the Strawberry together for an ombre effect. Really nice product!,29 Jan 2025,Try It!,midnightwithme,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"This is such a pretty color!! It's slightly pale but gives the perfect pop when blended out. If you're looking for a liquid blush that is super light, lasts all day, and looks natural this is for you.",29 Jan 2025,amazing!,lexi929,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

This is the first liquid blush I’ve ever tried and I’m absolutely in love with the color and formula! It was so easy to blend and this color ended up being such a beautiful spring color. It was also really easy to blend!,28 Jan 2025,Love the color!,jaynabethany,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"Such a dope product! I love Huda's liquid blushes & the cute little applicator which doesn't transfer an overwhelming amount of product. This blush is easily blend-able & buildable. I personally love using it for an ombre look with the ""watermelon pop"" shade. This UBE color is such a cute & girly shade, I feel extra pretty. I feel like pink does that in general for me, so I was very intrigued with this shade. Product smells yummy too! I genuinely am enjoying this blush & want to try other shades now because it's just so easy to use & blend. Mind you it is a small tube BUT you don't need a lot of product because the formula & pigment do the job very well. (gifted in exchange for honest review)",28 Jan 2025,Small but packs color!,AEllyB,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"I love this formula especially some of the darker colors, but this color did zip for my deep winter contrast. It will probably be nice for others but if you look like me, maybe skip it.",28 Jan 2025,Color is a nope for me,giginessa,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"Its formula is not bad but too many good liquid blushes came out and many of them out beat this one (formula wise) like YSL, Armani and Hourglass with similar prices, better longevity and blending. So I wouldn’t suggest you get their regular colors unless you’re a collectors. BUT this Ube color wins my heart. Lilac is always my personal favorite color but I never use this color for my face because I have light-medium skin tone with neutral-warm undertone so normally Lilac doesn’t work on me. This one is different. Yes! It looks a little too cool when I dot it on my cheek but it sheers out once I start blending it. It doesn’t look so cool and pale. Instead, it turns to a little pinkish with lilac at the same time. It brightens up my cheeks. It also looks so natural. It’s the most unique color blush in my collection and I can’t stop reaching for it.",28 Jan 2025,Love it for the color!,ptsau,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
Gorgeous color & formula especially for neutral/cool undertones girlies. Blends out easily.,28 Jan 2025,💕,seraya,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"HATE it. You get such a TINY amount of product (4.5 mL - literally HALF of a travel size perfume) - for $32, when you could get the Armani liquid blush, which has almost 3 times the amount of product (12 mL) for less than twice the price ($56). The packaging for the Huda blush is also SO cheap and terrible, and the applicator feels cheap too. Plus, the blush has basically zero pigment, so you have to use a LOT to actually see anything. Such a waste of money. Returning.",28 Jan 2025,Hate it.,kitcat99,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
I absolutely love the color of this blush and the formula of it is also very interesting once blended out I feel like it feels like powder. The formula and color are spot on. I would of never imagined I would love a purple blush as much as I love this one.,28 Jan 2025,Obsessed,Isabel1817,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"Really love this blush! It blends out like a dream and I applied it directly to the skin then blended it out with a fluffy brush. It wasn’t splotchy at all. The color is pretty pigmented but melts and blends out so beautifully. It definitely has a blurring effect. I’m not sure about the applicator. I like a doe foot but this is more circular so not as easy to get the amount of product on the face as I’d like. The small bottle is perfect for travel, and this will definitely last a long time because a little goes a long way!",28 Jan 2025,So beautiful!,BoyMom143,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
Love this product. Goes on smoothly! I would recommend,28 Jan 2025,,anabelitaa,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
This is giving very Barbie era. It’s a cool pink/purple shade! I’m not sure if I pull it off but I think it could be nicer on a darker skin tone. This is too cool for me. It is super pigmented so I would built it up.,28 Jan 2025,Pretty but very cool toned,yarahaik,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
Love love love the pigment with this blush. It’s really true about a little goes a long way. It does have a scent but it isn’t overbearing and it’s barely noticeable. I would say it’s definitely great for beginners,28 Jan 2025,a must try,Ballernikk,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

I want to love. This is such a unique blush color. However I just don’t get the payout as I see on social media. I have to add 3 coats to get a color like so much product. I’m pretty fair skinned too so I just don’t understand,27 Jan 2025,Pretty Shear,Rachlovin,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"Super impressed with this UBE - Blush Filter by Huda Beauty! The color is beautiful, and the formula is perfect. It blends well, smells amazing and is the perfect shade of pink for all skin tones. I had never used liquid blush before this and now is this has become my new favorite. Now, the texture of the blush is just perfection. It’s creamy and soft, so it glides on like a dream and blends effortlessly. Whether you’re going for a natural, barely-there flush or something more noticeable, it layers beautifully. It doesn’t feel sticky or heavy either, which is a huge win for me. I highly recommend!",27 Jan 2025,A must-have!!!,Mandy1114,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"I already knew I love this blush formula so I was excited to try Ube! I know this is meant for deeper more olive skin tones than me ( I’m cool/neutral light), so I was so surprised when this looked SO bright almost highlight-y on me. Don’t get me wrong it’s pretty but I’m confused how it’s meant for people deeper than me.",26 Jan 2025,Very bright,,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"I had high expectations for the UBE Blush Filter, but unfortunately, it didn’t meet them. The texture felt a bit off for my liking, and the application wasn’t as smooth as I expected. The color payoff was underwhelming, and it didn’t seem to last long on my skin. In the image it shows a black woman using it but it did not work on my skintone at all. Overall, I didn’t find it worth the hype. While it might work for others, it just didn’t work for me. I also don’t like the packaging. I think it’s the worse I’ve ever used for a blush. I’ve tried this blush in the deepest shade and the lightest. No.",26 Jan 2025,Not worth it.,esital,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
I really  adore this amazing blush.  It's perfect for me me. Nice and pigmented shade with  great  quality.  I really  like the  effect with  just 1 lil pinch.

"The scent of this product is super yummy, like vanilla. The packaging reminds me of the early 2000s jelly trend and could fit in your pocket. Personally, I don't feel the Ube color is for me I am a light neutral skin tone and I think if I tried a different color I would probably use this more.

"I became a big fan of this blush with the shade Strawberry Cream and jumped at the chance to try Ube. Like the other shade I have, i really like the level of pigment this provides.  I would have never otherwise tried this new shade, but it blends out really beautifully and actually layers well with Strawberry Cream for a beautiful ombré effect. You do have some time to work with the product before it sets, which I like. In addition to layering well with other shades of the blush, it also Layers beautifully if you want to set with powder or a powder blush. It seems to have good lasting power too. The packaging isn’t my fave but at the $21 price point, it works. Would recommend. For reference I have fairly well balanced, mature skin.",26 Jan 2025,,AChewning,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

Even the color has barely any pigment to begin with on my cheeks and the same exact thing happened on the back of my hand after attempting to blend with a dense brush, fluffy brush, and a dampened beauty sponge.

"I have used this product about 10 times. The color is pretty, however I have some qualms. It looks like the SAIE blush in the burgundy warm color “spicy”. I do find that it doesn’t layer very well over specific products. I use the CT contour wand in light and it looks patchy over it and the kosas foundation. You have to work quickly because it dries fast and then won’t blend. I have to blend it out a lot because it is pigmented but that’s also a good thing. Overall it’s okay. It has decent lasting power. It is heavily scented so if you have sensitive skin I do not recommend it. I would opt for SAIE on spicy instead. Bledabolity is better, works well over liquid foundation and is not scented.",25 Jan 2025,Just okay for me,Cas7Bin,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"This formula is truly gorgeous! It blends seamlessly into the skin and can be built up easily for the perfect flush. Whether you're going for full glam or a more subtle, soft glam look, it provides a natural finish with a touch of glow without being too over-the-top. That said, the shade Ube Cream is a bit tricky for my skintone. At first, it didn't look quite as flattering on me, but I gave it time to warm up on my skin, and it definitely grew on me! It's a shade that works best when mixed with other blush products for a more balanced, customized look. Overall, I really enjoy the formula and the versatility it offers, it's a great addition to my collection. While Ube Cream might not be my perfect match on its own, I can see it becoming a staple for adding a unique, soft flush when paired with other shades.

"So far, I'm liking this product a lot! This blush has a more pink color with a purple undertone, which I really like for my skin tone (I lean more cool-toned). The color is very fun and vibrant, but it's easily buildable, so you can adjust the intensity to what you like best. When you first apply it, you have to blend it out almost immediately; otherwise, it dries down rather quickly. The current viscosity of the product makes blending slightly more challenging for someone like me with dry skin. I prefer a thinner, more emollient texture with blushes, as they are easier to blend with my skin type. However, it still blends out pretty well. The product seems to have a slight blurring effect, which looks really nice and helps to give a flawless, airbrushed effect. I usually pair this with the Easy Bake Powder (Cherry Blossom Cake) like I did in this photo for an even more flawless look. The product also has a slight scent to it. So far, I've enjoyed all of the scents that Huda's products have, including this one. To me, it has a very sweet, cake-like smell. It definitely fits with the ube birthday theme.",25 Jan 2025,So fun and vibrant!,stellareviews10,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"I’ve been wanting to try an interesting shade of liquid blush for a while now, especially a purple-violet tone that looks both natural and flattering on the face. When I saw the announcement that Huda Beauty was launching a new shade, I couldn’t wait to be one of the first to try it! The blush packaging is love at first sight! so cute and visually appealing! The sweet, Candy scent makes this product even more charming, and the fragrance lingers for a long time. The small size of the applicator makes sense because the blush is highly pigmented, and just a couple of small dots are enough to blend beautifully onto the skin. The product works well over foundation and has impressive staying power throughout the day without needing to be set. I also love the fine golden shimmer in the formula, which reflects beautifully in the light and adds a unique touch to the blush. Without a doubt, it’s one of my favorite blushes right now!

"This is a gorgeously pigmented color. It's a pink/purple hue with an emphasis on the pink. I was not sure if it would look good on my very light skin but it looks beautiful! It even has a sparkle/glitter (which I Love) I'm 43 and I find it completely appropriate. It's done very well. I'm still learning the art of liquid/cream blush but I do know that this blush is very buildable and blendable. It also has strong staying power, so I don't see it coming off during a workout or a hot, humid day. I found an oil based cleanser worked the best to take it off. I played around with it and I also used a little on my lips and as an eyeshadow too with great success so I consider this blush as multi-use.  I also think the packaging is really really cute. Overall, my expectations were exceeded as well as its performance.",23 Jan 2025,Expectations and Performance Exceeded,Bethsatx,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"I'm obsessed with a pinky/purple blush, especially at this time of year. As someone who has a few similar colors in different brands/formulations (the closest I had before purchasing was the Em Cosmetics lilac serum blush), I had no business buying yet another blush in this color family, but I'm so glad I did. Immediately vibrant on the first application but still buildable, the color payoff is strong without being intimidating or overwhelming. I had an easy time blending it out on bare skin and over complexion products; in neither case was the application patchy. I haven't tested over a long period of time yet, but if the swatch on my hand is anything to go by, it sets pretty nicely without a lot of budge room after it dries down. If you/your skin can stand a scented makeup product (as with all Huda products, this is dripping in fragrance), I'd recommend picking it up - I think it's going to be my new staple liquid that I reach for when I'm in a pink mood! That said, while it is distinguishable enough from other similar blush shades in my collection, the color is not so radically different from other pinky/purpley blushes once it's on the skin; you don't need this if you already have a similar product.",23 Jan 2025,My new pink/purple go-to blush,jag02010,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

This new shade is absolutely gorgeous and looks amazingly beautiful.

"I’m constantly in awe of how Huda Beauty manages to outdo itself with every new launch. Just when I think they’ve reached their peak, they prove me wrong again! Their latest release, the Ube Blush Filter, is a testament to their innovation and creativity.
At first, I was a bit skeptical about its bold, vibrant color and whether it would suit my skin tone. But to my surprise, this stunning shade complements all skin tones beautifully. On my complexion, it creates a natural flush of pink that’s absolutely gorgeous. Just three tiny dots are enough to give you a fresh, radiant look for the day—though you can layer it for more intensity if desired.
The formula is lightweight and infused with buildable pigments and finely milled micro-pearls, delivering a soft-focus, high-impact glow. The peanut-shaped doe-foot applicator is a game-changer—it glides effortlessly across the skin, making application super easy and precise.
What I love most is the subtle yet luminous glow it imparts, striking the perfect balance between natural and radiant.

"My last Huda Beauty blush review of ""Cotton Candy"" started out: ""I have been hoarding liquid and cream blushes since I passed the 50-threshold. They just blend and sit so much better on my GenX skin than powder blushes do...This goes straight into my 'top 3' blushes ever."" It was such a favorite, in fact, that I immediately purchased the ""Strawberry Cream"" version immediately. 

Huda's Blush Filter Soft Glow Liquid Blushes are described as “a lightweight liquid blush, with buildable pigments and finely milled micro-pearls, for a soft-focus, high-impact glow”. Not only do they truly provide a soft-filter effect, the same colors also seem to magically work with just about every skin tone. ""Ube"" is no different. It becomes the perfect lilac-pink combo on my porcelain pink-undertoned skin. It also looks equally as gorgeous on a friend with much darker warm-toned skin. The blush has a wonderful mild cake-scent that isn't overpowering. It's a treat from start to flawless finish. Ube lasted all day with no caking, creasing, or settling.

Don't be afraid of the bright, shocking color. Just start slow - blend blend blend - and build coverage as needed. You won't regret taking the leap. It's another 10 out of 10!",17 Jan 2025,Huda did it again!,shutterblog,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"I absolutely adore Huda Beauty blushes, and the Blush Filter in Ube Cream has quickly become one of my favorites. As someone who loves rosy tones, this shade is perfection. It features a gorgeous mix of pink and lavender—a soft pastel lavender hue that may seem a little intimidating straight out of the bottle, but once applied, it transforms into the most subtle and flattering shade.

What makes this blush stand out is its beautiful filter-like, shimmery finish. It leaves a delicate, glittery glow that adds a touch of elegance to your look without being overpowering. It’s perfect for anyone who loves a feminine and radiant effect. The formula is so versatile that I can wear it even without foundation. In fact, as someone with pale skin, I rely on blushes to bring life to my complexion, and this one is perfect for everyday wear.

The texture and blendability are outstanding. Whether you prefer to use your fingers, a sponge, or a brush, this blush blends seamlessly, leaving a smooth, natural finish. It’s lightweight, breathable, and buildable, making it ideal for any occasion. Plus, it eliminates the need for highlighter because of its luminous shimmer.

One of my favorite things about this blush is the delicious scent—it’s subtle yet so inviting that I almost want to eat it! The fragrance adds to the luxurious experience of using Huda’s products, making it a joy to apply every time.

The shade Ube Cream is versatile and pairs beautifully with just about any look. If you’re into pinkish, pastel, or lavender tones, this shade is a must-have. It has that perfect balance of soft color and radiance, making it wearable for any outfit or mood. I also own Huda’s Cotton Candy blush, which I loved, but Ube Cream is truly next-level.

"So I'm going to be honest: when I first saw Huda Beauty's Blush Filter in Ube Cream on multiple videos, i was extremely nervous, only because of the bright color. The first time i tried it, it looked almost non existent on my skin. I had put five small dots on my cheeks to ensure i didn't put too much on. As soon as I started to blend it, the color went away and I was disappointed. The next time I tried it,  i just smudged it on my cheeks and it was too much. But when I added 10 dots on each cheek, the color looked absolutely gorgeous on my skin, the pigment is absolutely stunning! 

The packaging is correct when it mentions it is a buildable formula. It has a peanut shaped applicator, and melts on your skin. 

Don't get me started on the smell of the blush. ""Ube Cream"" smells of a delicious pastry, such as a luscious cake. It smells so good, I want to eat it! 

Overall, it's such a beautiful blush color that wonderfully compliments my skin. Can't wait to try it with the Easy Bake Baking and Setting powder!",15 Jan 2025,Absolutely gorgeous,khollywood11,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"This blush is a bold, electric lilac with soft pink undertones, and the color is very pretty on its own. However, I love mixing it with the shade Strawberry Cream for a more ombré look. It’s highly pigmented, so a little goes a long way; I usually apply just two drops and blend, and it blends easily for a seamless finish. It is buildable, so I suggest starting light and building up to your desired color. It leaves a nice, natural finish. Sometimes, I like to pop a bit of this shade on my lips over a lighter-colored lipstick for a cohesive, playful touch to my makeup. The applicator is a doe foot and gets the right amount of product.

"Hello everyone I received huda blush filter from skeepers. One of the standout features of the Huda Beauty Blush Filter is its ultra-creamy texture. It applies effortlessly onto my skin and has a smooth, almost airbrushed finish, which is great for creating a natural, lit-from-within glow. The formula also has a touch of luminosity, making it perfect for those who prefer a dewy finish over a matte one. Even on more textured or dry skin, it doesn’t settle into fine lines or pores, which is a huge plus. The blush is highly pigmented, so a little goes a long way, but it’s easy to build up the intensity to your liking. The product blends beautifully, offering a flush of color with a radiant sheen, without being overly sparkly or glittery. In terms of wear, the Huda Beauty Blush Filter lasts a good amount of time, staying vibrant throughout the day without fading or patchiness. It's versatile, working well both on its own or layered with other cheek products. The only con will be if a person prefers a matte look to looking dewy on their cheeks.",6 Nov 2024,,kelseyburns,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"So happy with this blush! Easily buildable, does not get patchy & it feels like nothing is there. I love liquid blushes that blend in verses dry you out, & this is one of the good ones. The shades are beautiful too & I think can compliment any look. My favorite way to apply is with my fingers to warm it up & more precisely move it to where I want, but a sponge works well too. This isn't too intense where one dot makes you look extra blushy, so I think it is very beginner friendly as an added note.

This is such a lovely blush color that really glides on beautifully onto the cheeks or whatever area I apply it.

"I recently tried Huda Beauty's Blush Filter, and I have to say, I'm really impressed. This liquid blush gives me the perfect balance of color and glow, leaving my cheeks with a soft-focus, airbrushed finish—no filter needed.

The formula is lightweight and blends so easily into my skin. I love how the micro-pearls in it add just the right amount of glow without being too shiny. The blush is buildable, so I can layer it for a more intense pop of color or keep it soft for a natural flush.

What really stood out to me is the innovative peanut-shaped doe-foot applicator—it makes applying the blush a breeze. I simply dot it on my cheeks and blend it out with my fingers for a seamless, multidimensional finish. The candy scent is also a fun touch that makes the whole experience feel a bit more indulgent.

I appreciate that the blush comes in five shades that work across all skin tones, so finding the perfect one for me was easy. Whether I’m going for a subtle glow or something bolder, Blush Filter gives me the flexibility I need.

"I don't think I've ever tried anything by Huda Beauty that I didn't like. The formulas are superb, and this blush is no exception. I received the shade ""cotton candy"" and it's very pretty.

I used it on my bare skin first, which is cool and rosey, and it was a very pretty and flattering shade for my tone. I used three tiny dots per cheek and was able to easily tap it in and achieve my desired color payoff, which means this should last me for some time. I didn't realize it at first, but when I caught my reflection in the sunlight, it has a very pretty shimmer/glitter. It's also worth mentioning that it smells really good, sweet.

"The HUDA Beauty Blush Filter Soft Glow Liquid Blush has become one of my new favorites for a natural, glowing look. The first thing I noticed was how easily it blends—seriously, it almost melts into the skin, leaving no harsh lines, just a soft, airbrushed flush. The formula feels super lightweight, so even if you layer it for more color, it doesn’t get heavy or cakey.

I was a little unsure about the doe-foot applicator at first, but it actually makes applying the blush really easy and precise. I can dot it right where I want it, then blend with my fingers or a brush, and it just looks seamless. And the glow it gives is so pretty—not glittery at all, just a soft radiance that really wakes up my complexion.

Plus, it has this sweet, candy-like scent that’s fun without being overpowering. I also appreciate that it’s free of parabens, sulfates, and other irritants, so I feel good about using it daily. If you’re looking for a liquid blush that’s easy to use, buildable, and leaves a beautiful glow, this one’s worth trying.",1 Nov 2024,A Must have!,sindhujar22,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"I was excited AND a bit nervous to try this Blush Filter in the shade “Strawberry Cream” as I am a complete newbie to liquid blush. Because I have such fair skin, it is very easy to overdo blush for me and I worried I would be even more prone to doing so with a liquid formulation. A little does go a long way which means this will last me forever! I found it easy to blend and tone down if I was too overzealous with my application. Two small dots on each cheek was more than enough to get great color pay off. The thing I most loved about this product was how natural it looked with almost an airbrush effect. It lasts and lasts all day long which is something I do not experience with powder blushes which tend to fade quickly for me. This may have changed me into a liquid blush user from now on! Definitely recommend and if you’re new to liquid blushes, I promise it isn’t as scary as it looks!",1 Nov 2024,Made me like liquid blush!,sef988,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"The Huda Beauty Blush Filter is a beautiful addition to any makeup lover’s collection, especially if you’re looking for a soft, airbrushed look. This blush line promises a silky finish that blends easily onto the skin, creating a natural flush that can be built up for more intensity.

Here’s a breakdown of the highlights:

	•	Texture & Formula: The blush has a finely milled, lightweight formula, which gives a smooth, filter-like finish. It’s a powder blush, but it doesn’t feel chalky or overly dry. The formula glides on seamlessly and doesn’t sit on top of the skin, blending effortlessly with other makeup products.
	•	Color Range: Huda offers a versatile color range that complements various skin tones, from light to deep complexions. The shades are thoughtfully curated, with options that lean warm, cool, and neutral, so most people can find a shade that suits them.
	•	Pigmentation & Wear: This blush is moderately pigmented, so you can go for a light touch or build it up for a bolder look without it appearing patchy. It has great staying power, typically lasting most of the day without fading, even on combination or oily skin.
	•	Packaging: True to Huda Beauty’s aesthetics, the packaging feels sleek and sturdy. It’s compact enough for travel, and the transparent lid makes it easy to find the right shade in your makeup bag.

Overall, the Huda Beauty Blush Filter is a high-quality, dependable choice if you’re after a soft-focus blush with excellent blendability and long wear. Its range and finish make it a worthy addition to any makeup routine.",31 Oct 2024,My favorite,viktoriia1994,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

This is a nice option if you’re looking for a very buildable blush. It took a few layers for me to really have a pop of color but I appreciated that I had control over how much I wanted.

If you find glowy blushes to be too dewy and don’t dry down right, maybe this is a good intermediate for you. Also this is scented and smells like cotton candy. If you don’t like fragrance stay away. I really like the scent though.",3 Jun 2024,Cotton Candy Blush,rareblueberry,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"So I’m actually not a big blush person, but I’ve always wanted to try it to see how I would like it. And am SHOCKED at how much I actually love it!!!

I have fairly enlarged pores so was always nervous blush would make my pores more noticeable, but this does the opposite and almost blurs them even more! Mind. Blown.!

I got this Huda Liquid Blush in the shade “Cotton Candy” (and the scent Cotton Candy because it smells sooo good)!! And it’s the perfect shade for me, especially since I’m a beginner with blush and it’s not too bold BUT is buildable for sure! You can put just 1-2 dots on or more, depending how much or how little YOU prefer!!

Absolutely recommend! I’ve never tried a Huda Beauty product before, but this definitely won’t be my last Huda Beauty product!!",4 Jun 2024,Beautiful! Buildable! Doesn’t enhance my pores!,DMJ917,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"🌸 If you're on the hunt for the perfect blush that gives you a natural yet radiant glow, let me introduce you to my new obsession: the HUDA Beauty Blush Filter Liquid Blush in the shade Cotton Candy. 

First off, the packaging is absolutely adorable. The innovative peanut-shaped doe-foot applicator makes it so easy to apply just the right amount of product. Just a few dots on each cheek, and you're good to go! 

Now, let's talk about the formula. It’s lightweight and feels like a dream on the skin. The pigments are buildable, which is amazing because you can start with a subtle hint of color and build it up for a more intense look. And trust me, it blends like a dream. I usually just use my fingertips to blend it out, and it melts into my skin effortlessly, leaving a beautiful, seamless finish.

The shade Cotton Candy is a gorgeous baby pink that gives my cheeks the perfect pop of color. It's super flattering and gives that soft-focus, high-impact glow that we all crave. The finely milled micro-pearls in the formula add a touch of radiance without being over the top. Plus, who can resist the yummy candy scent? It’s a delightful little bonus that makes the application process even more enjoyable.

What I love most about this blush is its versatility. Whether I'm going for a no-makeup makeup look or a full glam, this blush delivers every time. It has major staying power, so I don't have to worry about it fading throughout the day. And did I mention it's free of all those nasty ingredients like parabens and sulfates? It's also cruelty-free, which is a huge plus in my book.

A little HUDA hack I’ve been loving is combining shades for an ombre effect. I pair Cotton Candy with Strawberry Cream for a fresh, multidimensional look. Start with three dots of Cotton Candy on the apples of your cheeks, then add two dots of Strawberry Cream higher up and blend together. It’s so easy and looks stunning!

"*I am a Sephora Community Ambassador and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.

In all honesty I had very low expectations prior to trying this. Liquid blushes in general are typically not my favorite formulas; I usually prefer a cream or powder but I'm always game for trying a new product. I'm actually pleasantly surprised because I genuinely think that this is a good formula, definitely better than I had anticipated.

I have a light skin tone but I went out on a limb and chose the darkest color, Black Cherry, because I've been trying to add a couple of blushes with purplish undertones to my collection.  I was a little hesitant since I didn't know how blendable the formula would be and I wasn't sure if the shade would be too dark for me but after using it a couple of times and with different application methods I've been impressed by how easy it is to use and how nice it looks on the cheeks.

It has a slightly thick gel-like consistency and I've had no difficulty applying it both under and over powder and it hasn't smudged or lifted my base makeup either way. I can either apply it to the back of my hand and pick it up from there with a brush or sponge or I can use the doefoot applicator and apply the product directly to my cheeks and blend it out- - either method works fine.  The formula allows just enough play time for it to be adequately blended before drying down so it doesn't end up looking patchy or splotchy. Even though this is the darkest shade I can make it work for my skin tone but because it is quite pigmented initially I think it will be beautiful on darker skin tones.

Another thing to note is that it seems to have a slight staining quality to it so it lasts quite a long time. I've even lightly applied it to my lips and it provides a wash of color that looks absolutely beautiful. I definitely see myself getting more use out of this than I had initially anticipated and I think that it's a fairly intuitive formula that a lot of people will be able to us",7 Jun 2024,Beautiful Formula,CookieGirl1,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"This is a lovely liquid blush. It applies so well and blends nicely. I love the filtered look. It has a nice buildable pigment. I got the color strawberry cream and it gives a nice sunkissed glow. It has a very slight fruity sweet scent, but it is not strong at all and dissipates quickly. It has such a lightweight feel to it and it holds up well all day. I like to apply with the applicator, my fingers and/or a blush brush. It is easy to take on the go.",7 Jun 2024,,rusky1415,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"I've tried my fair share of cream blushes and I love them. This Huda one has managed to get some little things right that elevates it above the rest. First, the packaging is so cute and the doe-foot applicator manages to be more precise than others.

I like that this smells a little sweet but isn't too strong. Finally, this really blends like a dream.

It’s pigmented enough but not so pigmented like that popular one that you have to be careful. You can blend with fingers or brush or sponge and it looks flawless. It’s like a satin finish so not too matte or dewy. Amazing summer blush,10 Jun 2024,Beautiful,Kiles,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"I like this blush but I definitely wish there were some things different.

Things I like: the candy scent, the formula is smooth,  blends out easily, it is buildable, the applicator isn’t messy, the shade is pretty on my complexion. 

Things I don’t like: I slightly feel the formula on when it dries down, it’s way too glittery. It’s less luminous and more sparkly.  The camera has a hard time picking up on how glittery this is. 
If you like sparkly then you would really like this. Very beginner friendly formula.
It’s good but could be better.",11 Jun 2024,Good but sparkly….,MarissaIwanowsk,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"I absolutely LOVE this blush!! From the packaging, to the application, to the longevity... it checks all the boxes.  The packaging is super cute. The application wand is unique and delivers a good amount of product which makes it less likely that will apply too much.  It blends out beautifully and seamlessly.  It dries down so I don't even have to set it which I love because I don't like using powder as it makes my skin look very dry.  I have the color Cotton Candy and it's a beautiful, subtle pink. It can be built up into a deeper flush if desired.  It does not transfer once it's dried down and it lasts throughout the day. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",12 Jun 2024,A new Fav!,chawkins8,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"This looks lovely once it’s blended out. The colour is very pigmented. I wish the applicator was a little thicker. The formula feels a little drying considering it’s a liquid, but I think it’s the long wearing formulation that does this.",12 Jun 2024,,lswp,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

I applied it under powder and it looks great. It was easy to blend out with a brush and kept its pigment. There is a little bit of sparkle in the product but it wasn’t noticeable to me on my cheeks.

"The new Huda Beauty Blush Filter Liquid Blush is so easy to blend. The description of it melting into the skin is true. I have the color Watermelon Pop. That is actually how it smells too! It is a warm brick color, on the darker pigment side, but it looks just fine on my light skin if I sparingly use only one or maybe two drops at most. It actually looks the exact color I flush when I am hot or I blush. As far as it being “radiant”, I would call that sparkly, borderline glittery. I wish it was not quite so sparkly. But, because it blends nicely, it isn’t so bad if I am sparing or just set it with powder. The package is the absolute cutest thing, it looks like candy.",13 Jun 2024,"Too sparkly, but blends well",thejunglerose,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"This is a really nice liquid blush option and one I would recommend to those who are a bit hesitant to try a liquid blush. It has moderate pigmentation: 2 to 3 dots is all you need so it’s not overly intense right off the bat. It does have a nice buildable aspect to it allowing you to layer to your desired intensity. It also blends every easily with your fingers or a brush, allowing a little versatility with application. They give a very natural finish, leaning slightly dewy, but don’t slip around the skin, even on my oily skin type. They do have a bit of sparkle to them, which I don’t love but it doesn’t appear glittery on the cheeks, I just think they could do without. They are also heavily fragranced like many other huda products. Think  sweet candy. It smells delicious but just be aware if your skin is sensitive to scents. Overall a very easy to use liquid that lasts well and has a really pretty range.",15 Jun 2024,Easy to use liquid blush,LeahGPerez,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"I purchased both strawberry cream & cotton candy. The smell of these blushes is sweet and candy like which is nice.

"I have combination skin with fine lines and mild texture. I'm fair skin with neutral and cool undertone. I prefer color with a neutral undertone (on occasion with a cool undertone) in mid to deep shades. Eyeshadows in mid to deep blues, purples (not plum), greens, browns and greys. Lippies in brown with purple (not plum) undertone, vampy reds, muted purples and deep mauve and berries.

Another beautiful product by Huda Beauty. I chose Black Cherry, which is quite pigmented. It's beautiful. It's easy to blend and work with. If you apply too much you can follow up with concealer or foundation to tone it down. I find I reach for this more than the blush stick (I still love the blush stick) lately. 

The only cons for me are the lack of parabens and the glitter. It's more glittery than luminous. Let's hope it lasts as long as my other (non-""clean"") makeup and doesn't grow bacteria without those needed parabens.

At a time when we are seeing tons of luminous blushes hitting the scene, which don’t really look great on my skin, I was so excited to see a matte, blurring formula! As advertised, this blush truly is effortless to apply. It blends out so easily and it’s pretty much fool proof. Unlike some other liquid blushes that are so pigmented that it’s easy to go overboard, this one is much more forgiving and you really can’t mess it up. You can apply with fingers or brush or sponge… It works well any way you do it. I really could not be happier with this formula!",16 Jun 2024,,sarahjeangirl,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"So, I recently got my hands on this blush in the shade Cotton Candy, and let me tell you, it's the cutest addition to my makeup stash! This blush totally gives my cheeks that perfect pop of pink, making them look all fresh and glowy. The formula is super silky and blends like a dream, giving me that natural, flushed look I'm all about. The best part is that I can layer it up for a subtle glow or go all out for a bolder look, depending on my vibe. And can we talk about the shade Cotton Candy? It's as delightful as it sounds and adds a fun touch to my daily makeup routine. This blush is totally my new fave!",17 Jun 2024,Gorgeous shade,,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
This blush - in the shade cotton candy - is so fun and pretty and a beautiful shade for my skin in the summer. The formula is really blendable while also being buildable so the coverage is adjustable. Big big fan,17 Jun 2024,,adramerah,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
This applicator is sooo cool but when I used it on my cheeks I’m not sure if it is not creamy enough but I had a hard time blending it out and it turned out a little splotchy. Sadly not my favorite blush,17 Jun 2024,A little splotchy,jaxkubo,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
I love peach sorbet so much! Looks like a lip gloss and spreads like one too except it isn’t crazy pigmented and it’s not so hard and dry.

The cotton candy shade is absolutely gorgeous on my neutral light skin tone. Sometimes I like a more natural look and just do a dot or two and blend with a brush. I wasn't sure how well a liquid blush would blend but it is easy to work with and spreads out nicely. I have been very impressed.,16 Jun 2024,Blends beautifully,Mabower88,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"Dries matte with shimmer/glitter, it was smaller than I expected but thankfully a little goes a long way and I didn’t have to apply too much to my cheeks. It blends well but does dry quickly so I wouldn’t wait too long to start blending after you apply it. I tried using it as a lip color too and it was okay, the shimmer isn’t as flattering on the lips and it might bleed a little, giving the popsicle lip effect.",17 Jun 2024,Great for travel/on the go,ashermyers,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"This liquid blush is absolutely amazing. It is easily blended out with a brush or damp sponge. It is super buildable, which I don't find a lot of liquid blushes are - so many of them require you to use the least amount of product and you still end up with a harsh application. I was not aware when buying that it was lightly scented, but the cotton candy scent is beautiful without being sickly sweet. It also fades fairly quickly so if you aren't a huge fan of the scent, you don't need to worry about it lingering all day.",17 Jun 2024,Love this blush!,HannahDfy,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"My friend and I went out for a stroll and we decided to stop by a Sephora cause we had a few things we wanted to get. I was rushing to leave and didn’t get to wear blush so I tried this one out since I was already planning on grabbing one. I dabbed the product first on the back of my hand and then tapped it on my cheeks, when I tell you I squealed cause it literally took 5 seconds to blend out and it was so pretty, I immediately put one in my basket lol. I have to say though, I tried this on clean, bare skin and it doesn’t perform as great as it would on top of makeup. I had to layer at least 3 times to get pigment to show up while on top of a base 1 layer was enough.

"*BOUGHT WITH MY OWN MONEY* I purchased the shades black Cherry and cotton candy. This is hands down my favorite blush release within the last few years. As a girl with really pale olive skin, I struggle finding blushes (especially red blushes) that look good on me. If you have olive skin please please get the shade black cherry, it has the perfect amount of purple in it to look natural on my muted olive skin. Besides the beautiful color, the formula is also incredibly easy to work with. I can dab this on with my fingers or a brush in less than 10 seconds and it leaves a really nice subtle glow on the cheeks. I find that the black Cherry shade is also really long lasting, it kinda acts like a tint, but one that is really easy to blend. This formula is also pretty blurring on my skin.

I recently got the Huda Beauty Blush Filter in shade cotton candy. The shade is a really pretty neutral pink that I think would work on a lot of skin tones. I am pretty fair and it looks nice on my skin. It also kind of smells like cotton candy which I love but if you are someone who’s sensitive to fragrance then it could be an issue. It’s not overpowering and I can’t smell it while it’s on my face but you can smell it when you open it up. It lasts pretty nicely throughout the day. The color diffuses really easily for a lighter look or you can build it up for more intense color.,24 Jun 2024,So pretty!,dmhall3,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

I received this product as a gift from HudaBeauty to test and give my honest review. I can honestly say I love this product! I have tried several liquid blushes but always ended up going back to powder. I will definitely be using Blush Filter from now on. It blends so well leaving a nice blush that isn't streaky or overwhelming. The color is fresh and pretty but not unnaturally strong or overpowering. This liquid blush is so easy to work with and looks very natural. I had given up on liquid blush but I am so glad I had the chance to try Blush Filter from HudaBeauty. It is a game changer.,3 Jul 2024,A new must-have,mejpye,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

Very disappointed considering the price. I wish the ads would have noted more about the finish.",4 Jul 2024,Beautiful but glittery!! Getting returned.,afincannon,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
This blush is super smooth and easy to blend. I found that the pigment does blur out as you blend it so I ended up going back and adding a few more dots after the initial blend out.

"Absolutely LOVE this blush. I’m a huge blush girl (I have tried everything from high end to drugstore). I’ve always been a rare beauty liquid blush fan, and while that is still probably the most pigmented blush I own, this formula is amazing. it’s lightweight and easy to blend, and feels like nothing on the skin but it has a lot of pigment. A lot of blushes that tend to be as thin as this formula lack in pigment, but this doesn’t. It also smells like watermelon, which doesn’t bother me but it may not be for some who are sensitive to scent.

Maybe if I just applied the huda blush alone I wouldn't have noticed it?🤷‍♀️ I like quick, fast, long lasting and easy to blend but this just wasn't it for me. And I didnt have any dry patches. I was well hydrated, etc so it was the product. Maybe it works better for some than others.
I got the strawberry cream color and compared it to haus labs glassy rosette. They were very similar, in color. Huda was slight more cool toned I think. Strawberry cream is a beautiful color, just didn't work for me.",1 Aug 2024,"Just okay, color was beautiful",LicyPiecey,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

Black cherry is a beautiful red with a pink undertone that mimmicks natural flush from the cold. it's so blurring for a liquid formula and I prefer this over Rare Beauty any day. I didn't like rare beauty because it was so hard to blend and too thick and oily. while this one is watery and gives a watercolor effect on the cheeks and looks so natural and healthy. it has shimmer while swatched on hand but it doesnt translate to the cheeks. it is pigmented so the doe foot gives just the right amount of product. my fav blush is tarte natural beauty but it doesnt last on the face so this is the best dupe I've found. milani has one too but huda formula is better and doesn't settle into pores. I will repurchase this 100 times.,6 Oct 2024,tarte natural beauty and milani berry smooch dupe,ybettysongy,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

I received the shade Watermelon Pop! It provided the most beautiful flush of color and you don’t need too much to create a punch of color. I’d recommend a gentle hand. The shade itself is more of a brownish red in my opinion and it looks really beautiful on my medium deep complexion. The formula is quite creamy and I also like the applicator they chose. I prefer to apply this product with a brush as it prevents it from being patch in my opinion. I’d pair this only with a luminous face base as to ensure this formula is compatible with whatever foundation you choose. I found the wear time to be really good after testing it for the day. There’s a lot of cream blushes out there but I definitely think this one is worth trying!,19 Oct 2024,Luminous Flush,Briwebb709,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"The Huda Beauty Blush Filter was my first experience using liquid blush, and I must say — I quite like it. Historically speaking, I have avoided liquid blush because I imagined it feeling heavy, however, the Huda blush is super sheer and lightweight. I have it in Strawberry Cream, and it offers a nice buildable pigment. Although I have tan skin, this would definitely work on fair skin as well as deeper skin tones. After applying the product, if you look closely it has a very faint shimmer (probably from the mica that is listed as an ingredient). The blush really does melt into the skin. It has a subtle candy scent that is not overpowering. I would definitely purchase this product in the future.",23 Oct 2024,My First Liquid Blush!,Svvy2,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

Seamless blending: It melts beautifully into both bare skin and over foundation, so no streaks or patchiness in sight.
💖 Finish
Soft matte with a natural radiance: It gives the skin a healthy glow without being overly dewy or shimmery—ideal if you love a natural finish.
No caking or heavy feeling: Even with multiple layers, it feels breathable and looks smooth on the skin. Oily skin? No problem—it stays put without sliding off.

"The Huda Beauty Blush Filter in the shade Cotton Candy is a great long-lasting baby pink blush that gives a beautiful blurred, natural dewy finish. It blends smoothly and adds a soft pop of color that looks fresh throughout the day. However, what I don’t like is the heavy fragrance—it smells sweet, almost like cotton candy, which I find unnecessary. I don't think blush needs to be scented at all, as it can be a bit overwhelming. Despite the scent, the overall performance of the blush is impressive.",24 Oct 2024,Heavy fragranced,katekidze,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
"This is a really pretty rosy shade and has a sweet scent. I hope they continue to expand on their color range. When I swatch this on my hand, it looks matte but as I blend it shimmer appears. It’s more noticeable in this shade than Cotton Candy but when I apply it to my cheeks with a sponge, it looks very natural. I do not like the applicator. I don’t think it applies the product well. I prefer to put it on the back of my hand then work from there. I think this has great pigment but isn’t too much and it wears nicely. Only thing I would change is the packaging.",24 Oct 2024,Beautiful shade & formula but annoying applicator,loveheatherette,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"I have been hoarding liquid and cream blushes since I passed the 50-threshold. They just blend and sit so much better on my GenX skin than powder blushes do. So after seeing several reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on Huda Beauty's liquid blush. I chose the color ""Cotton Candy"" because I have very light, porcelain skin with pink undertones and the description (baby pink) sounded right up my alley. I was not disappointed. This goes straight into my ""top 3"" blushes ever.

The blush is described as ""a lightweight liquid blush, with buildable pigments and finely milled micro-pearls, for a soft-focus, high-impact glow"". I couldn't have written a better product description myself. It seemed to glide on the skin and make it look lit from within once it was blended and buffed. In the wrist-swatch I've included you can see how well it blended and worked with my skintone, and that is taking into consideration the large amount I used for photographs. With liquid blushes, less is always more so I could get by using 1/3 of the product that I used for swatching. It was nearly impossible to photograph but up close when the light hit the blended-in blush just right it would almost sparkle. Not a ""Twilight"" / ""I've just been to a glitter convention"" type of sparkle, but more of a youthful luminance. Once blended, the ""filter"" was in full effect as my fine lines just seemed to disappear. It lasted all day with no caking or settling. I didn't even mind the candy scent.

Not only would I give the product a 10 out of 10, now I want it in Strawberry Cream (dusty rose) for winter and Peach Sorbet (peachy tangerine) for spring/summer as well!",25 Oct 2024,"My favorite new-try in a long, long time!",shutterblog,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"I recently tried the Huda Beauty Liquid Blush Filter in the shade Cotton Candy, and I’m absolutely in love with it. This blush has quickly become a staple in my routine, especially since I’ve been discovering the ease and versatility of liquid blushes. They're effortless to apply, blend seamlessly, and save so much time compared to powders.

The shade Cotton Candy is a beautifully light, pastel pink that has such a soft, feminine appeal. It sits perfectly within the pastel pink family, giving just the right amount of color without overpowering the look. I find that just three small dabs of this blush are all I need to create a subtle, natural flush. You can adjust the intensity easily by adding more product if desired, but a little goes a long way.

What sets this blush apart for me is the hint of shimmer it contains. It’s almost like a built-in highlighter, giving a gentle, luminous glow that catches the light in the most flattering way. When I wear it, my skin has this beautiful, dewy radiance that’s hard to achieve with other blushes alone. The formula blends seamlessly with the rest of my makeup, creating a soft, glowing finish that feels effortless.

And then there’s the scent! As the name suggests, it’s got a light, delicious fragrance that actually smells like cotton candy. It’s so inviting and adds a delightful touch to the experience of using this product.

Overall, Huda Beauty nailed it with this blush. If you’re into pastel pinks or looking for a blush that feels feminine and fresh, I can’t recommend Cotton Candy enough. It’s perfect for those who appreciate a delicate, subtle touch with a bit of glow.

Even so, I think the shade is gorgeous, and I’m really glad I gave it a try.

The pigmentation is perfect—not too intense but buildable, so it’s easy to customize your look from a light tint to a more pronounced pop of color. The shade range is versatile, flattering a variety of skin tones, and the packaging is sleek and travel-friendly. It feels lightweight, and there's no caking or patchiness, which I appreciate. Overall, it’s the ideal blush for a healthy, radiant glow. Highly recommend!",29 Oct 2024,Must have in your vanity,stylingwithappy,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
I recieved this item in exchange for my honest review. This Huda blush is so easy to apply. The Applicator wand gives a good amount so you don't really need more than 1 or 2 dabs.  It blends out very easily on skin with or without makeup. I like that it is small and easy to throw in my bag. I don't have to worry about it getting everywhere. I tried the shade Watermelon Pop. This shade definitely has more red pigment in it than i thought. After blending it out tho it did make a nice dull red blush. I only used one dab and it was plenty pigmented.,29 Oct 2024,So pigmented but easy to blend,Busybeebarlow,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
The color that i got is STUNNING!!!! I love that a little goes a long way and keeps my face nice and bright and dewy!! I use this on nights i’m going out since it lasts forever and never gets muddy or patchy!,29 Oct 2024,So so perfect!,alltimejenna,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"OBSESSED! | love a liquid blush so I was super excited to try the new Hudg Beauty Blush Filter. I chose the shade ""Strawberry Cream"" and it is the perfect, most universal dusty rose color that works perfectly with my Light/Neutral skin tone. First the applicator is really nice and allows you to apply a tiny dot at a time which is important because this blush is super pigmented! But she blends out like a dream, is super buildable, and gives a subtle blurred finish that my 40+ skin loves! Lasts through a full work day and beyond. My new MUST HAVE!",29 Oct 2024,LOVE!!,AprilW79,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

Can’t recommend it enough!",29 Oct 2024,Absolutely love! ❤️ new favorite!,brinaaaaak,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"Pearlized, luminous blushes are my favorite so I was very excited to try this. Unfortunately, I was a little underwhelmed with the formula’s performance. There are plenty of beautiful micro shimmers but the base of the formula dries down matte and QUICKLY. For that reason, I found working with it to be a little difficult. It would set in place before I had a chance to blend it out as much as I wanted. The shade I chose was a deep berry, though, and I suspect a lighter shade might be more forgiving to work with as it won’t appear so intensely on the skin.",29 Oct 2024,"Beautiful shimmer, difficult to blend",Grrracen,Huda Beauty,Blush,No
Absolutely loved the pigment of this liquid blush and found it to be long lasting. My only thing is I felt like there was little product to work with on the wand at times and it seemed like there wasn’t much in the tube either compared to other liquid blush products I’ve used.,29 Oct 2024,,xokellyyy,Huda Beauty,Blush,No

"This is a great beginner friendly liquid blush! Normally I do not recommend liquid blushes to newbies or those that want an easy look because for most liquid blushes, even a tiny dot will give you a ton of pigment and then you look like a clown, so i end up having to swatch it on my hand a bit, dabbing the color from there, etc. But no need for this! You can apply directly to the skin, it’s hard to mess up. If you want more color, add more on too, it is very buildable.
