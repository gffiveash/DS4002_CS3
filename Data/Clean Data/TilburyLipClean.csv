"I love the colour and the consistency (and while I generally dislike the sting of plumper, do not feel like this one is bad at all) but the packaging is terrible! Every time I take the wand out, I have to be extremely careful to not have the product leak down the outside of the case. Returning after use is even worse! I think the applicator tip is too wide for the opening and this causes too much contact. The wand itself though also attracts a lot more product than any other gloss I have used before so it just oozes down to the sponge. Most often, when I close the lid, I end up having to wipe excess gloss that leaked. I love the look of the packaging but am totally wishing I could transfer it to one that actually works.",02 Feb 2025,"Love colour and consistancy, awful leaky packaging",kexy,Tilbury,Lip,No
I like the color but it definitely does not plump my lips. There was a bit of tingling which I don’t mind but it did nothing volume wise. Overhyped and overpriced imo.,29 Jan 2025,,jossyT,Tilbury,Lip,No

"Best lip plumper Iv ever used, not only does it not sting like other lip plumper but the color and the consistency is perfect and so smooth.",11 Jan 2025,,brook1717,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This is a GORGEOUS color- and it’s so lightweight it’s more like a serum texture. Not sticky at all- even a little runny in the tube. But THE PLUMP is there and it adds more color to the lips as it plumps, it does burn but it’s not unbearable like some other plumpers I’ve tried (and my lips were chapped when I applied it in this photo) so I can imagine it doesn’t burn as much on unchapped lips. But this is my new favorite gloss so glad I tried it!!",10 Jan 2025,HELLO PLUMP,jessssejess,Tilbury,Lip,No

Love the gloss and the color. The reason I gave it a three stars is because it leaks everywhere therefore I can’t travel anywhere with it. It has to stay in my vanity drawer standing up.,3 Nov 2024,Good but……,berly1967,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This is a decent gloss. Nothing amazing. What I don’t like is the packaging. Mine constantly ‘leaks’. There is always a little gunk around the wand, even after I thoroughly clean it. I don’t want to keep it in my purse because it gets on everything. Doesn’t matter how often I clean it, it still ends up seeping out around cap.",17 Oct 2024,Bad packaging,MamaMeg1975,Tilbury,Lip,No
"love the shade and formula, the plumping sting is pretty strong so if you’re not a fan of that i’d opt out but i actually like the plumping feel, also the darker shade looks great on darker skin tones, my biggest Con with this product is the packging, it leaks constantly and the stopper basically does nothing, its stained 2 of my purses and  2 friends of mine have had the same problem, we both have to csrry our goosses in separate zip loc bags but the formula is fine, just the poor packaging does not mske me want to spend the $$ on it until it changed.

"the scent of this gloss is similar to their lipsticks with a soft, subtle milk-chocolate scent. it smells luxurious and there is a slight tingling sensation, as with any lip plumping product. i am very fair and purchased in the fair-medium shade and its perfect. i am tempted to get the darker shade too! i notice my lips feeling more hydrated and smooth after using this as well.",8 Oct 2024,gorgeous!,emmythered,Tilbury,Lip,No

I realize this may not be for everyone as the plumping formula is strong at first but it goes away and I don’t notice it anymore.  Leaves my lips fuller and the shade goes well with other lipsticks or just with a lip liner.  Not sticky feeling and lasts well. Already on my second tube💕,19 Sep 2024,Lips do appear plump yet moisturized love!💕,dazzlestar9,Tilbury,Lip,No
One of the glossiest if not the glossiest lip gloss i own. I don't care for the plumping effect. I love the smoothness of it and the shade is pretty. It could be a Lil bit thicker in my opinion. overall I'm very happy with it and I reach for it very often! wish there was more than just 2 shades.,19 Sep 2024,My favorite,luv4beauty,Tilbury,Lip,No
When i first got out i was surprise on how cute the packaging was it was giving off “better than sex” brand packaging everything went good it was stinging my lips like what a lip plumper do. But then i realize the gloss was leaking out of the packaging.,17 Sep 2024,Eh,strawberryxli,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Truths - its does have a tingling sensation even if it touches your tongue. There is too much gloss on the application and spills over the cap. 
Its a nice shade and very very glossy. As we know - gloss does not last so re-apply is a must.
It does not plump - I believe the ""tingling sensation"" is a correlation that its working. It is not. Refer to a mild cayenne pepper tingle. 
Its either a fun feeling that is must be working or a dislike feeling that it is not. 
I can tolerate the feeling and will use the rest of the product, but will not purchase again.",12 Sep 2024,The Tingle does not mean its working.,TransAM,Tilbury,Lip,No

I love the colour and the plumping effect doesn't bother me.  I have a high tolerance for tingling on my lips so take that for what it is.  I hate the packaging.

I enjoyed this lipgloss. The scent is subtle but nice. I think the color is pretty universally flattering. It is a little too glossy for my preference and doesn’t have a ton of staying power. The plumping is subtle as well.,3 Jul 2024,Nice color and subtle plumping,ericarae367,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I have both colors and was honestly really impressed. With a lipliner, these are very long lasting in color and in a mild plumping effect. Both of the colors are really nice and good for everyday.

"Shiny and painful. Not sure how much it plumps. I should have gotten the darker shade, since this one is the exact cokiyr of my lips, and so is the Fair Pillow Talk lipstick.

"I am not a big gloss person, simply because many formulas are so sticky that’s it’s uncomfortable to wear but this gloss defintely changed my mind about that. This is such a beautiful creamy gloss i received color fair medium which is a beautiful soft pinky mauve color. Only thing I would say is that I don’t think it’s plumping like it says it does it’s only a tingly feeling but I personally don’t feel like it does anything to “plump the lips”. Aside from that this gloss is super creamy and glides on super easilyu I love the big doe foot applicator as it makes it super easy to apply.

While this gloss is pretty and in pretty packaging, it burned my lips like crazy, and I can tolerate most lip plumpers. I was also disappointed because within 15 minutes the gloss had worn away my CT matte pillow talk lipstick and the lip liner too.

"I bought this lip gloss and was obsessed with it. The only thing I don’t like about this product is that it burns my lips.

"This product did nothing to plump my lips and, in fact, irritated and chapped them. I have used some pretty decent plumpers over the years and was really disappointed this this one. Plus, I find the packaging sort of embarrassing for a grown woman. It's not luxe. It's a chunk of oversized plastic that says Pumpgasm in big letters up the side. Color is okay, but zero staying power. Returning ASAP.",13 May 2024,Ignore the hype and keep walking...,Souxie,Tilbury,Lip,No
"While using the New Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Lip Gloss I noticed that within seconds, my lips started to tingle and there was a coolness.I was very impressed with the initial plump of my lips when first using this product, however the thing that I loved most was the gorgeous glossy finish. I recently received Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss for free from Influenster and I most definitely recommend this Lip Plumping Gloss to everyone out there who is looking for the perfect Lip Gloss that will make their lips look irresistible.",13 May 2024,~Must Have Lip Plumping Gloss~,Kalley334,Tilbury,Lip,No

"This is actually a really solid gloss with a beautiful neutral color that works well on its own or as a gloss topper. It has a vanilla marshmallow scent and has the lip plumper tingle.

"I received the complimentary Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss in the shade Medium Deep in exchange for my honest review. The packaging is super cute!  The lip gloss glides on smooth, feels moisturizing, and non-sticky. A slight tingle begins within seconds of application (like Carmex) Then it intensifies and it gives a hot & cold sensation. I am not sure how they figured how to do that but it actually feels hot then cold, hot then cold, hot then cold…. Then eventually fades away. I really like it!  I didn’t have any adverse reactions. The shade I chose is perfect for every day.  I already have juicy lips to begin with, but I didn’t mind them getting juicier at all! This is a lip gloss I see myself reapplying multiple times a day and will definitely consider purchasing once I am done with it.",1 May 2024,The Juicier The Better!!,OlenaRosanne,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I really like this gloss. It's not sticky but it still wears pretty well, and my lips actually feel good even after the glossy look has faded. Definitely feels hydrating. Nice scent. It's not earth-shattering in regards to the plumping aspect, but I do see a boost. I must be in the minority about the packaging though. The colour of the tube is pretty, and it feels substantial (definitely not flimsy!) but I find it too gimmicky and ostentatious. Really nice product. Really silly packaging.",1 May 2024,Made me a fan of gloss again,retroredhead,Tilbury,Lip,No

I was not a fan of the packaging. It was a little too bulky for me (takes up too much space in a purse). I’ve tried a lot of lip plumping products and I don’t like a burning tingling sensation. This one gave you just that. The color is nice but the burning feeling it gives you doesn’t really make my lips feel or look any fuller? It’s just “ok”.,30 Apr 2024,Bulky packaging with little pay off.,LuxeLaur,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Didn’t get this product for free, but bought it during the Sephora sale.

"The packaging is very cute! I feel like all the Charlotte Tilbury items have beautiful presentation. As for the scent, it smells like sweet marshmallows! It doesn’t bother me, but I would prefer different smells. It’s very shiny and pretty, I like the color on my lips. I don’t normally use lip plumper products but the slight burn? Sting? Was a little surprise, but got used to it over time and it goes away after a while. I’m not sure how much of the plump effect is the light on the gloss or actual “plumping” but overall it’s a cute color!",30 Apr 2024,Pretty and tingles!,kzdc,Tilbury,Lip,No
This is definitely a plumping product! Make sure to keep this product out of your actual mouth as the taste is weird! You can feel your lips tingling as soon as you put the product on. I love color pay off and ease of application.,29 Apr 2024,Pump pump pump it up!,KendraAb,Tilbury,Lip,No

first of all the packaging is so cute! and the one thing that really stood out to me is that this lip gloss doesn’t have a chemical smell to is all all. it’s a very good smelling lipgloss. the pluming is not super maximizing. it has a slight tingle to it and does make a difference but not if you wanted big results which i prefer.,29 Apr 2024,love !!,zuezuelove,Tilbury,Lip,No

Not my favourite… was hoping it would plump like Too Faced lipgloss. Didn’t even come close. And the wand and tube of gloss is so big. Just seems like an overpriced flashy gimmick gloss. Sorry to report.,29 Apr 2024,Recommend you pass,Blairejo,Tilbury,Lip,No
I'm not a gloss girl so sticky texture is always a thing I don't care for but this feels nice on the lips. The color was pigmented and not too sheer.  The tingle is tolerable and there was slight plumping but not anything jaw dropping.  I'm not sure the cost is worth it if you can find a cheaper plumper gloss.,28 Apr 2024,Tingle is tolerable. Pigment is good.,danadel24,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This lipgloss has been so long-lasting and not sticky! It doesn't burn like some of the other brands do. There is a slight tingle, but it's cooling, and it doesn't last too long.

I received the medium to deep shade and even though I am light it looks great! I actually prefer this shade since it’s a bit darker  and I can even wear it on its own. The packaging is absolutely stunning! Feels and looks very luxurious as per usual with this brand. It definitely tingles when you apply it but I actually like the feeling. Lips look plump and juicy but it’s a very comfortable formula. It’s not sticky or too thick! Highly recommend!!! Will be getting more shades.,28 Apr 2024,Love!,Lizrso1,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This plumping lip gloss is quite great. The color matches my complexion very well, the formula has a nice feel, not too thick or sticky. You definitely do not need to. Apply a lot.

"I love loved this color. It was just enough dimension on your lips without being too much. As soon as you apply it, it’s got the nice warming and plumping effect on your lips. It does last for a little bit but you start to forget about it. I’m not sure that it made them super plumped, but I really enjoy it and like to believe it’s made a significant impact on my thin lips.

"As I’ve said before, I’m not much of a lip person because my lips are so tiny, so I was pretty skeptical when I received this lip plumper from voxbox in exchange for my honest review. Though it didn’t give me the luscious juicy lips that I desire I did like this product. It was a beautiful, deep color, and it gave just the perfect amount of tingles in the lips not too intense, but it was still there.! Would  I purchase this again? I don’t know.. maybe, maybe not but if I ever do decide to purchase some sort of a lip plumper lip gloss, then this would definitely be it!",27 Apr 2024,I like the tingle,meganlindey91,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I’ve always enjoyed charlotte tilbury products and this one feels nice as expected. This is luxurious feeling lipgloss that’s non-sticky, with a slight tingling on the lips that feels comfortable and plumping. The packaging is big but also cute. I was skeptical of the medium deep shade at first but it turns out to be pretty flattering actually, since my lips are naturally darker so it looks quite natural with a neat tint. I wish it’s more long lasting and moisturizing though as I find that I have to reapply after a few hours. Overall pretty solid and I’d love try a different shade.",26 Apr 2024,Comfortable and slightly tingling,sphinxlikebecca,Tilbury,Lip,No

Lasted about 30 or so mins. The initial application of this gloss made my lips look Glossy like glass. I love it. Smells great too.

"I received this item free from influencer in Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review.

I am super thrilled to be trying on and reviewing the one and only PILLOW TALK BIG LIP PLUMPGASM PLUMPING LIP GLOSS BY CHARLOTTE TILBURY!!!  

First off all of the  Pillow Talk line is legendary and has a high reputation to uphold, so I was eager to explore this lip plumping option.

The packaging is GORGEOUS from every angle. The pink and gold tube is like a luxury pillow in lipstick form that fits perfectly in the palm of your hands.

Unlike others this plumping formula offers an icy burn! A little coolness to tame the flames while the ingredients add a spicy fullness to your pout. 

This recipe has some heavy hitters HYALURONIC ACID + COLLAGENEER, along with Charlotte Tilbury technology to bring your kisser to the next level of fullness!

The tingle lasted around 20-30 minutes or so and slowly lessened its intensity as time passed.

This glossy, glass-like finish is a gorgeous pink/nude and is you perfect accessories for day or night.

My lips felt hydrated and nourished, while this glaze gave my lips some high shine goodies.

The experience was, top tier from beginning to o end!

"The first experience with this lip plumper is the packaging I was instantly impressed by how luxurious the bottle was at such an affordable price point.

"Thank you to Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury for this complimentary product to review. OBSESSED!! The lip gloss color is pigmented and flattering and absorbs into my lips without the color piling when I wear it for a long time. The lip gloss wand is big and shaped uniquely so I can quickly and precisely apply the gloss. The gloss leaves a minty type of tingle on my lips rather than a burning sensation, and I enjoyed the feeling. I did not experience lip plumping or my lips appearing larger but it did make them look and feel so moisturized. The gloss leaves a sheen on your lips without being sticky, and my hair would never get caught in my gloss. The packaging is cute although I wish the font was the classic charlotte tilbury font on the back, to make the name more subtle. Overall, I have worn this gloss every single day and can’t get enough!",23 Apr 2024,Hydrating even after use,sho444,Tilbury,Lip,No

First I have to say the packaging is so adorable I really love how the gloss bottle looks. But I wasn't the biggest fan of this gloss I feel like it was very lackluster.I feel like the gloss didn't hold up throughout the day and it wasn't a big fan of the smell of it.,23 Apr 2024,Cute Packaging but,SadieRechinn,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I enjoy the color and gloss of this product. It leaves your lips tingling like the feeling of eating something that’s a spicy cinnamon. It’s easy to apply and the applicator is a great shape and the perfect balance of firm and soft. While I’m not entirely sure if it truly plumps my lips, I do like the product and have been using it when I want a glossy look.",23 Apr 2024,Great color and gloss,TWBeth,Tilbury,Lip,No
"this was gifted to me from CT and I have to say im quite impressed. packaging and applicator is A1, very happy it isn't one of those rounded humongous applicators like the inn beauty ones. formula is good, slick and not a whole lot of stickiness. as for the plumping and intensity, I feel the formula is comparable to the Dr dennis gross one in the gold packaging. definitely plumps and is relatively strong, also the medium deep shade is just gorgeous flat out. its almost the exact color as my lips which I love.",23 Apr 2024,exquisite,haxelprincess,Tilbury,Lip,No
"The Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm may be a product I may not usually reach for, as I have not used many lip plumping products in the past, but this lip gloss is truly a crowd-pleaser. I have gotten several compliments since I’ve started using it – the color of this gloss is so flattering and the perfect your-lips-but-better shade. The perfect not too cool, not too warm pink nude. It also gives a subtle shine to the lips that I found to be long-lasting. On top of being a flattering shade and formula, it gives a subtle plump to the lips that is just enough to feel like you are getting that extra oomph from the product. It tingles slightly on application, which is the plumping ingredients kicking in, but settles quickly after. I would enjoy it without the plumping component but like it even more with that extra bonus. Very impressed with the product but not surprised – Charlotte Tilbury just knows her stuff when it comes to creating great and flattering makeup.",23 Apr 2024,Charlotte Tilbury for the win again!,MarybethWill,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for review purposes. 
The outer packaging is simple but the gloss tube itself is kinda tacky looking. I would not want to have it displayed on my vanity. I chose the med/deep because I have medium skin tone. The color of the gloss is beautiful and subtle. The tingling is quite intense for the first 10mins and stays till about 30mins. The applicator is plush and makes application very easy. The formula of the gloss is excellent. No stickiness at all and very comfortable to wear all day. It does not dry out my lips. It does give a slight plumping effect but I have naturally full lips so I could not tell if there was much of a difference. It does make the lips look juicy and plump.",23 Apr 2024,Excellent formula beautiful color,26titli,Tilbury,Lip,No

"The packaging is adorable, and it has a pleasant vanilla scent with a lovely color. However, I only noticed a slight difference in plumpness. While it's a nice lip gloss with good color and wear, it didn't quite deliver the intended plumping effect for me. I'll continue to use it as a regular gloss, though.

"Have mixed feelings about this plumping gloss. As far as plumping goes, I do think my lips look plumper, smoother, and healthier with the gloss on. The texture is on the thicker side, but in a good, moisturizing kind of way; a lot of plumbers leave behind cracked, irritated lips after they wear off, but my lips feel better off after using this gloss. I’m not really sensitive to the stinging of plumping gloss, but this is def one of the more intense and long lasting ones. I don’t suggest using back to back as the lips do start to feel more irritated the second time around. I made the mistake of picking the color according to my skin tone (light to medium), when I should’ve picked the one better for my lip tone (medium/deep). The color is definitely a lot lighter than the marketing pics!",22 Apr 2024,Mixed feelings…,EmiAUH,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This pillow talk, big lip, plumping lip gloss has the cutest packaging! I received the medium deep color lip, gloss, free for testing  purposes. I really like the color against my skin tone.

The texture is smooth and comfortable on the lips, but I didn't notice a significant plumping effect. The minty sensation is refreshing, but it didn't quite deliver the noticeable fullness I was hoping for.

"This plumping lip gloss worked wonders, even on my naturally small lips, providing a fuller and slightly more plump appearance. Its thick, slightly sticky texture, which I personally enjoy in lip glosses, ensures even coverage and long-lasting wear. Unlike typical plumping glosses, it offers a subtle tingling sensation, akin to a minty freshness, without any discomfort. The shiny finish, pleasant vanilla scent, and moisturizing effect make it a go-to for daily wear. I find myself reaching for it often, not only for the plumping effect but also for the gorgeous light pink nude shade that's perfect for everyday use.

"I received this lip plumper free from Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster for my opinion.
Lip plumpers don’t usually work for me, I have yet to find one that works. I tried the new CT Big Lip Plump Gasm. I like the shade I got (light-medium). It’s pretty, but not really buildable. I applied it on one side to see any difference, as you can see in the picture, it really didn’t work. Not saying it’s the product, it’s my lips. I felt the slight tingling when it was on my lips, but after 10min, nothing happened.

The lip plumper is the iconic pillow talk gloss with the comfort of a balm that plumps the lips and hydrates overtime and immediately.
With heat & ice technology it’s supposed to plump without the sting.",20 Apr 2024,Love the Packaging,karakay83,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. Though incentivized, my opinion is entirely my own. For reference, I am in my late twenties with small-medium sized dry lips and no filler. I personally LOVE plumping glosses, I prefer a stingy-type or a cooling-type over a “hot” pepper-type of plump, but I enjoy the sensation of them all and have tried many varieties of plumping glosses previously. I received the Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss in the shade “Medium-Deep.” The packaging is bulky and, in my opinion, gaudy. The applicator is a diamond-shaped pointed doe foot that I find easy to use and dispenses a good amount of product. The gloss has a cake-like scent behind the hard-to-miss plumping ingredient scents. The color is divine, both built up and sheered out I find it to be a beautiful “my-lips-but-better” type of color. It is a sheer wash of a cool berry mauve tone, in my opinion, that adds a perfect, effortless, glossy tint on me. I find the texture to be slightly thick-but in a good way, it doesn’t feel like an oil like some glosses do and it isn’t sticky in my opinion. I prefer this thicker texture as I feel they have better longevity on me than very thin, watery glosses tend to. When you first apply the product, the plumping ingredients are unmistakable. If you do not like a plumping sensation, I highly doubt you will like this product. I feel that this gloss has both a strong cooling-type plumping AND a pepper type “hot” plump, which took some adjusting for me to have this icy-hot sensation rather than one or the other. Overall, it isn’t my favorite type of sensation and I do not feel it plumps as effectively as some of my other plumping glosses. However, I love the color, texture, and longevity as a gloss.

"I have the medium-deep shape of this plumping lipgloss and it’s a gorgeous shade. The packaging is also very cute and sturdy. It’s lightly scented and the scent smells sort of spicy. It gives a tingling sensation once a put it on but nothing that it makes me hurt. Once the lipgloss settles down, it makes my lips noticeably plump and juicy looking. 
It’s my favorite lipgloss i own!",20 Apr 2024,Gorgeous shade,Sushmi,Tilbury,Lip,No

"Screaming Thank You Thank You Thank You to @charlottetilbury @sephora and @influenster for this insanely gorgeous Pillow Talk: Lip Plumping Gloss in light to medium in exchange for my honest opinion and some truthful feedback. All I can say is “WOW!” This is another quality Charlotte Tilbury Product. Talk about a plumping gloss with the hydrating comfort of a balm in Charlotte's iconic Pillow Talk! Plump and hydrate your lips instantly AND over time! Innovative heat + ice technology provides a burn-free, sting-free plumped-up pout in seconds! Feel the Plumpgasm sensation get right to work. It’s magic while hyaluronic acid + lip-loving ingredients hydrate and smooth for your juiciest lips ever! So you can feel it working and you can see it working as well. There is not a thing that I don’t like. From the box, which is so feminine and exciting which makes you want to tear it off and put it on to the actual tube which is also beautifully thought out! It truly looks like a pillow. It has a doe foot applicator that does take a lot of product out so be sure to wipe some off before you apply to lips… it is SUCH a beautiful color! It gets to work immediately because you can feel it tingle but not burn but it begins to go to work on its plumping skills right away. It’s a gloss so it doesn’t turn to matte which I appreciate because I feel like everyone has jumped on the matte train late. It is easy to remove as well. I highly recommend this lippie and I hope she comes out with more shades!!!",20 Apr 2024,This is Beyond Amazing,Morg1122,Tilbury,Lip,No
I’m not a huge fan of lip plumpers but this one has to be my favorite. Pillow talk is such a beautiful color and the stinging from the plumper isn’t as painful as some. Plumps my lips pretty good. Makes my lips feel smooth and moisturized. I do enjoy the type of applicator as well.,20 Apr 2024,Obsessed,emilymneel,Tilbury,Lip,No

"This lipgloss is nice, the color is cute and as soon as I spread in my lips I could feel something different, like mint, it’s kind of cold but in a comfortable way to be in your lips. It didn’t last really long in my lips but made all the difference in my makeup.
Maybe I would try a different color, but in general is a good lipgloss",20 Apr 2024,,LiviaLiuzzi,Tilbury,Lip,No

"This lip plumper from Charlotte tilbury glides on beautifully and starts working almost immediately.  The shade pillow talk is a gorgeous color that I could see looking great on all complexions. There is definitely a slight tingling but nothing to intense.  Within minutes my lips appeared fuller and more hydrated. Will continue to use. I do plan to try laying it with the pillow talk lipstick just to see what happens. If you love pretty packaging like I do, you'll love the attention to detail that was put into this.

"This lip gloss is the spiciest one I've tried. I usually just get a tint of cooling or minty feel on my lips when using plumping lip gloss, but this CT lip gloss feels like I'm applying crushed chili to my lips.

"I really like this product! The color is pretty without being too much, and the tingle that comes along with the plumping is very mild compared to other plumping glosses I’ve used. The reason I took off a star is the packaging. I understand how it fits with the brand so it makes sense but as a mom and teacher I could never put this gloss on in public. The very suggestive and 3D details on the tube make it a deal breaker for me",19 Apr 2024,Beautiful Color-Crude Packaging,MrsBerry21,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This is the best plumping gloss I've ever tried. It fills in every little line and makes your lips look fuller and juicy. The plumping sensation lasts for over an hour, which I've never had one last that long, and isn't an uncomfortable feeling. The gloss is very shiny and not sticky at all. The gloss lasts for awhile too. Even after it's gone, your lips feel hydrated. It is $35 for 5.5 ml, a Little expensive for a lip gloss I think but the formula and packaging is top tier.",19 Apr 2024,No cons with this one!,Gleambeauty,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I received the Medium to Deep, which is a beautiful brownish berry-pink shade, and the other universal shade available is Fair to Medium, a pink nude shade. This color isn’t at all too deep for my fair skin, and actually compliments it really well. It’s also not too dark of a shade to wear with just about any outfit. The packaging of course is very luxurious and has an expensive look with a lush pink hue, nice weight and a diamond pattern pillow to top it off. The doe foot applicator is pretty large, and its pointed diamond tip allows for easy on swiping, coverage and precise lining. 

The formula itself is buttery smooth, non sticky, comfortable, glossy with a subtle hue. It doesn’t feel heavy but is noticeable and long-lasting on the lips. As far as plumping is concerned, you can immediately feel it when the tiniest bit touches your lips, but the tingling and cooling sensation wasn’t uncomfortable at all. The sensory experience was quite nice; certainly not painful and the intensity of that feeling dies down after just a minute. I definitely noticed my lips felt fuller, plus soft and smooth even after the gloss was gone!",19 Apr 2024,Great Gloss in a Gorgeous Package,Alyeeh,Tilbury,Lip,No

"It’s alright, it feels minty/tingly but the feeling is short-lived imo and doesn’t really plump. The formula is also kind of thin, I prefer a thick and plushy feeling gloss like the Patrick Ta or Lawless. It’s ok and the packaging is cute, but I probably won’t repurchase. Also I ended up buying the darker one because the light shade looks way more orangey in person than it does online.",18 Apr 2024,"It’s ok, packaging is pretty",ruru,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This gloss is gorgeous! The color was a beautiful deep neutral mauve. On my fair skin, the med-deep tone was definitely more dramatic than I would wear for everyday, but it is perfect for a night out. This plumped my lips, but the tingle sensation was more intense than I was expecting. If you aren’t a fan of the plumping tingle feel, you might want to skip this gloss, but otherwise I definitely recommend it!",18 Apr 2024,Extreme Tingle,Megamel88,Tilbury,Lip,No

"Pros: I like the color and shine—though it is a little too brown for a pink nude. It isn’t sticky and there is some plumping effect. 
Cons: this is billed as a “no sting” plumper and I for sure experienced plenty of burning and stinging. It does fade after a while but it isn’t sting free. Also, the container it comes in is rather bulky for no reason and made me pass over it to pack for recent trips.",18 Apr 2024,Eh,mjudes,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. Application is easy with a yummy smell and a cool tingling feeling. The plumping effect is minimal, but the gloss is very shiny and a lovely color. My only complaint is that it doesn’t stay on long and if you have to talk a lot it wears back and clumps into the corners of the lips and has to be cleaned up. Aside from that I really love this product and it works great on days you are able to carry it along for touch ups.",18 Apr 2024,Super pretty!,AnnaBallerina,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I'm a big fan of this lip gloss! To start, the packaging is adorable. It's a little over-the-top and obnoxious, but I think it's so cute and still feels like nice quality. The applicator is great, I love the size and how it tapers at the end so you can be more precise in the outer corners. The gloss itself is a very lightweight consistency and it's easy to get a nice, even application on the lips. The tingling is INTENSE. If you don't like plumping glosses, stay away from this one. I love the tingling sensation and I do feel like my lips look fuller after application. I wish the color lasted a little longer, but it is really sheer and natural-looking. This has definitely become a staple lip gloss in my routine, and I can't wait to try out more colors in the future!",18 Apr 2024,My New Favorite Gloss!,Maddiexx19,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I received this product from Influenster for free in exchange for my honest review. 
I expected this Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumgasm, Medium Deep, to be amazing. I've tried several lip plumpers, and this is not my favorite.. I like the instant tingle feel, because it feels like it's working.. but after leaving it on, it just barely plumped my lips... I love the color, it's not to bold or dramatic. I also love the glazed finish, like a lip gloss. It doesn't dry my lips out, which is definitely a plus. It's ok, I'll keep using it.. but like I said, it's not my favorite plumper!",18 Apr 2024,It's ok,TinaY091017,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I really loved this color of lip gloss. It is subtle, but yet you can tell there is some color there without being in your face. I’m not sure how well the plumping worked, but there was a good tingling sensation for a couple minutes. I like the applicator that allows for good coverage and when putting the applicator back, it clicks into places so you know it is secure.",18 Apr 2024,Good neutral color,Stef715,Tilbury,Lip,No

"Pillowtalk Plumpgasm Med Deep is a game-changer for achieving luscious lips. The shade selection is versatile, and the formula glides on effortlessly, providing a plumping effect without the discomfort often associated with lip plumpers. While the color payoff is impressive, I found the intensity to be a bit too much for my preference, especially for daily wear. However, the long-lasting hydration and subtle tingling sensation make it perfect for special occasions or when you want that extra pop of color and volume. Overall, it's a great option for those seeking fuller-looking lips with a touch of glam. I’ll for sure try it in a different color",18 Apr 2024,Great plumper,Karajean623,Tilbury,Lip,No

I received this product for reviewing purposes from influenster. I actually loved this. It instantly tingles when you apply it. I loved the color as well! It takes about a min or 2 to start plumping your lips but it definitely does. It also leaves your lips hydrated after you take it off. It doesn’t feel sticky and it’s a nice lipgloss to apply.

"So to be expected, it tingles a lot! As soon as it touches your lips it starts to tingle and the sensation doesn’t seem to go away. It doesn’t look like my lips look plumper. It has the “feeling” of it but I don’t see much of a change.",17 Apr 2024,Didn’t like it,VickyArmas,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I’ve used lip plumpers before.  They’ve always hurt my lips. They burn really bad, and seem to leave them chapped after use. This one has a very light cake like smell. The color looks really dark in the tube, but nice light and glossy on the lips. I feel like this pumped up my lips a little bit. My top lip looks more full than normal. Would I possibly purchased it in future yes! It’s quite moisturizing, and the tingle factor is not terrible at all! so this is a definite try for anyone!",17 Apr 2024,I really like this one.

"The packaging is beautiful.  Very detailed.  When you put the lipgloss on it has an intense burning sensation.

Has a vanilla scent.  Initially, it applies with a cooling feeling but transitions to a burning sensation.

"I love both of these colors and the fact that the medium one is a my lips but better shade. What I liked about this gloss is that the formula is very creamy. It applies very opaque and can be blotted to a more sheer coverage. The plumping formula did minimize the lines on my lips. I did find the applicator was really big and picked up a lot of product so I had to wipe it on the inside of the container. This did not last as long as other formulas I have tried. I think it wears a little less time because it is very pigment saturated and creamy. I find I do need a mirror to apply it though because of the applicator size. I typically don’t use a mirror whenever I apply loss, so I’ll probably just apply this one time a day.",16 Apr 2024,"Great color, large applicator",addictedtogloss,Tilbury,Lip,No

"This is without a doubt the most plumping lip product I have ever tried.

I have been using this plumping gloss for a few weeks now and I really like it! It is hydrating (a bit sticky) and goes on smoothly. I LOVE the color. You can feel the tingle of the plumping effect right away but it doesn’t burn like other plumping glosses. **Warning-the tube itself is a bit suggestive,16 Apr 2024,Pretty and Plumping,MrsBerry21,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I think its a 7/10! I love the texture- its not sticky or too thick. It smells amazing and it’s really nice on the lips. The plumping effect didn’t do much for me (couldn’t really see it) compared to my other plumping glosses- but you definitely feel it more. Aside from this I like how glossy it is- AND THE PACKAGING 🤌🏼

I got the shade Fair-Medium. Its the perfect pink for me!",16 Apr 2024,Its really good!,NicolaRosario,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I received this lip plumper from Influencer in exchange for a review. 

Pillow talk big plumping lip gloss lives up to its name. I tried the Charlotte Tilbury color and lived the natural shade it provided.

"This lip gloss is thick but not sticky. It’s a nice nude color that goes on with a sheer tint of color. Because it is a pumping gloss, it does tingle for about 30 minutes after applying. I’m not sure if it made my lips that much juicier, but I’d like to think so (it feels like it anyway). Either way, whether or not it makes my lips appear more plump, I’m not a fan of lip gloss, but I do like this one. Note, it has a 12 month shelf life after opening so use it or loose it. I rate this lip gloss 4 out of 5 stars. Note, while Charlotte Tilbury is cruelty free, it is owned by a parent company that tests on animals. The parent company is Puig, and this is not a cruelty-free company. If this matters to you.",15 Apr 2024,I like it!,lalena84,Tilbury,Lip,No
"The color and shine on this are gorgeous, and it's not super sticky, so it's a shame that this isn't a plain gloss. The plumper in it hurts so bad! I've never found a plumper that doesn't hurt, though, so maybe I just have sensitive lips? It feels cool like menthol at first and then after about a minute it turns into straight up stinging pain. I wiped it off, but in the five minutes I managed to tolerate it I did not notice any plumping effects.",15 Apr 2024,Stings horribly,allie3096,Tilbury,Lip,No
The packaging is so cute and very durable feeling. There is really no scent to it so if you don’t like scented lip products you will love this. The texture is is very thick but creamy. You definitely can feel this sensation of the lip plumping. And I love the color,15 Apr 2024,Love,Saminsider09,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Y’all! The packaging is so adorable! I just can’t! I am pink obsessed, so this is totally me! I love the formula of this lip plumper! It’s super velvety & creamy. It glides on smooth, and evenly. I’d say the plumping aspect of it is rather nice. 

It’s the perfect ratio of tingle/burn/cooling. A little of each. It’s subtle, and not super overpowering like some or the majority of lip plumpers can be. I’ve actually never really tried a lip plumper that is capable of doing all three until this one! 

This is the shade “Pillow Talk”, and it’s a medium deep color. Very pretty, and looks good on lighter skin tones, such as myself. I feel like it goes on kinda dark, then lightens up a bit once it covers over a larger portion of your lips. 

If you want to deepen the color, you totally can. Just apply another layer, until you’ve achieved your desired look! It’s super hydrating and ultra moisturizing, you simply cannot go wrong with this one! 

I absolutely love it! My absolutely go-to, as of lately! Thank you Charlotte Tilbury, for yet another amazing product I can totally obsess over! 10/10!",15 Apr 2024,Obsessed!,beauty0717,Tilbury,Lip,No

This Pillow Talk plumbing lip gloss by Charlotte Tilbury is so pretty on the lips. It has just a little tone that adds some color and glossiness to your lips. After applying it does have a slight tingling sensation but it's very minimal. The plumping affects works after just a minute or so and makes you have fuller looking lips. It helped my lips feel more hydrated and pretty. I would definitely get it again and recommend it to friends and family.

I like the little plump tingling. It's  cute, I don't need any more lips but the finish, the glass effect that was immediately evident after the first application. Everything was great.

This is everything it stands for. The product does NOT burn like other plumbers. It has more of an icy hot feeling and definitely plumps in minutes. The bonus is that it has hyaluronic acid and it blurs the lines on the lips.

"The Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm by Charlotte Tilbury in Fair-Medium has everything you need in a plump gloss and more! When I first put it on, I could feel the heat and ice technology working its magic. I could actually see a difference in my lips. The doe-foot applicator is so easy to use, it just glides right onto my lips. The only thing is, because I am so sensitive to products, this lip plump made my lips peel and I dont know if I will be buying more because of that. But maybe not everyone is like me and it works perfectly for the next customer!

"I had high expectations for this lip gloss but found myself disappointed. Pros: feels smooth on your lips, doesn't sting, has a nice scent, is an attractive natural color, and has good shine. Cons: it's so smooth and non-tacky that it seemed to wear off my lips almost immediately even when i wore it over a lip stain. Also, I did not notice much plumping (possibly because it wears off so fast). I do not think it's worth the high price tag.",14 Apr 2024,Disappointing,Jdubbs07,Tilbury,Lip,No

"Omgggg! I was so surprised to have been able to receive this and try it out!! I was literally crying because I was so excited! I can’t wait until my other review tasks for this product are available for me to do now that this is released because it is absolutely amazing!! I’m not a huge plumper person because I have tiny lips and a lot of plumper either don’t work, make my lips burn so bad and/or make my mouth break out almost due to a bad reaction. However this product, lordddd 😍😍 I didn’t have a single bad reaction to this whatsoever. I was nervous on how my lips were going to look once I applied this and waited for the results since, like I said above, I have tiny a$$ lips 😂 thankfully they didn’t look anywhere near as bad as I thought they were going to!! I definitely thought that it was going to look bad since I’ve always had tiny lips and never thought “bigger” or even “plumper” lips would look good! I’m so happy this product worked as well as it did (which I already expected and hoped it was going to because her products are always AMAZING 😍) because my lips turned out so much better than I expected! I happy with how my lips looked afterwards 🥹😍💜 I highly recommend everyone to try this plumping gloss! Especially if you haven’t found that “right” or perfect plumper for you!

"The packaging for this gloss is super cute. I like that it has a little window to see how much gloss is left. I was a little worried about the medium-deep color being too dark but it’s a nice color. It smells kind of sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The applicator shape helps you to get the cupids bow area nicely. The gloss is smooth and not sticky. It has a little tingle when you put it on but it isn’t a harsh burn like some plumping glosses. I really like it!",13 Apr 2024,Love it!,Maggie1418,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I got this lip gloss in Med-Deep shade, and was pleasantly surprised it is not too dark for my pale face.  It claims to plump without stinging or burning, and while it is a little easier to handle than other plumping glosses, it is not without sensation, and the more you put, the stronger the feeling.  When I used the applicator, the finish was quite goopy, but when I just placed a few dots on my lips and blended with my finger, it was quite nice.  The less you use, the less sensation you feel.  One day, I used the applicator to apply the gloss and went for a walk, and that was extremely uncomfortable for the first 15 minutes as whatever cold extract in the gloss interacted with the 55 degree wind.  Things settled after that, but by the time I got home an hour later, the texture was back down to what it would be if I only put a little bit.  I don’t think it would cause this issue in warmer weather, but it definitely stung and burned on that walk, and didn’t last. Since my lips were not plumped all that much for very long, the discomfort isn’t worth it to me, but try it if that’s what you’re going for.",13 Apr 2024,"Nice gloss, but stings, so limit amount",rspatterdock,Tilbury,Lip,No

"This is a gorgeous, gorgeous product. I love the color (Pillow Talk medium-deep, a glorious berry), I love the packaging, I love the level of gloss. I feel so luxe when I put it on. That said, I have come to the sad conclusion that plumping lip glosses are not really my jam--they have a tendency to make my lips burn more than tingle, and the pretty plumping is rarely worth the subsequent peeling. I am a delicate flower. HOWEVER, this one burns less than most, and it's such a gorgeous color I can overlook the sensation.

"This claims to be a plumping gloss with the hydrating comfort of a balm!
 
On my first application, I noticed that the immediate scent was SO sugary – like cotton candy 🍭
It definitely has the minty tingle like plumping lip glosses tend to, but it didn’t burn! It wasn’t an uncomfortable tingle, which I was pleasantly surprised by.
Immediately I noticed a plumping effect on my lips. They didn’t just look slightly plumped, but they FELT plumped too! The thing I liked about this product is that they didn’t make my lips SO big that they looked unnatural. Sometimes that is an issue with me for plumpers, they make my lips too big which makes them red because they get irritated. I didn’t experience either negative effect here.
 
After a few minutes I do feel like the tingle kicked up a bit on the outline of my lips, but the inner area stayed minty and cooling, which I actually liked. I am interested to see how this does over another lip product, and if I encounter any irritation with continued use or not.",12 Apr 2024,Great plumping gloss!,bbrown9684,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This lip plumper felt like it was doing it's job. It gets tingly and warm. Is thick enough that it stays in place, but also gives a glossy look that smooths over the lips. It did not dry out my lips. No strong flavor. Not sure if it really plumped? But I liked the color and it made my lips look nice!",12 Apr 2024,Lovely color,Mishie04,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Lippies are just my favorite and I was definitely excited to try this one out, the packaging is one of a kind and makes me feel boujee!!

"Like most lip plumpers I have tried, I saw no difference as you can see by the photos. However, unlike most plumping glosses I really liked the sensation. Instead of usual plumping products that are a burning sensation, this one is more of a cooling feeling which lasts like 30 minutes. The gloss itself is not sticky and a nice color.

"Wanted to love this, but I just don’t. Firstly, as a lip plumper, I didn’t find it to really do anything to my lips. They looked the same as before. No visible “plumping”. As a gloss alone, it’s pretty and does compliment my skin tone nicely. The other downfall for me was the tingling sensation that comes with this. I’ve used many lip plumping products in my time, so I’m no stranger to the tingle you feel when wearing. But this was borderline painful and distracting.

"I took photo of my lips right after applying (2), and 30 minutes later(3). The third photo the burning already stopped. It was not an itching burn, more like I brush my lips against something spicy but whipped it away quickly. I think this product did the opposite for me. I did feel the tingling and the shine was high. However if you look at photo 1 compared to photo 3 my lips look less plump. So l don't feel this worked for me.

The color of the fair-medium shade is a nude pink and it perfectly complements my fair skin. The formula is ultra hydrating and not sticky. This is my favorite plumbing gloss I've ever tried because it doesn't burn and sting your lips! It has a fire and ice technology that feels just like it sounds.

Love the color. It is a deeper warm pink but not too warm. It feels super soft and not sticky but I wouldn't say it is plumping. It's nice but not super minty.

This stuff is amazing! Pretty long lasting in comparison to some of the other gloss’s I’ve tried. It tingles quite a bit. I don’t think it “plumps” but it does leave a good shine.

"I was over the moon excited to try the Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss. First, what beautiful packaging! Charlotte knows how to impress us girly girls. I absolutely love the pinky nude almost mauve color of the gloss. When I put it on my lips, the tingling sensation began! There wasn't a weird smell which I appreciate and the texture wasn't super off-putting to me. I like that the gloss has coverage and makes your lips look lush and pouty. I will say it took me a few applications before I was okay with the feeling of the gloss. As you can expect, this is a more high end product so the price reflects the value.

What's even better is that it's super moisturizing, thanks to the hyaluronic acid and other lip-loving ingredients. Plus, the innovative heat + ice technology makes the plumping sensation completely burn-free and sting-free, which is a huge bonus.

"I'm not usually a big fan of lip plumpers, I hate the sting of the capsaicin. This product has the sting PLUS cooling so you can't really feel the sting unless you rub it off. It smells so good, the same vanilla scent as most other CharlotteTillbury products. It is luxury so if you're looking for drug store pricing this isn't it.

I have never used this type of lip care before but now I think I love it. I love the color and the shine and it tingles as soon as you put the gloss on your lips.

I should preface with I’m not a lipgloss girly. I don’t know how well it actually plumped up my lips. The color is kind of translucent so I would need to put something under neath. I definitely felt the burning sensation though.,8 Apr 2024,Not a must have,katelynmikhlan,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I’m going to preface this review by saying I’m not really a traditional lip gloss person. I like to layer glosses over lipstick but I’m very picky with the consistency. The gooey, thick glosses are not my taste but I know some like it. Having said that, there are definite pros and cons to this Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss. I think the name in and of itself is way too long and descriptive but that’s just me being picky. On the plus side, the presentation is gorgeous. It’s a very substantial, big tube with a creative flair and you can actually see the color from the see through “window” which is nice. The doe tip applicator is perfectly balanced and big enough to swipe a large area. There is a lot of product that comes out when you lift the wand however; a little too much in my opinion. Since this is a lip plumping gloss, you do get a cooling, almost minty fresh effect. It’s not overly tingly or uncomfortable like other lip plumpers. As with all plumpers, this gives the illusion of bigger lips using optical enhancers and light reflecting pigment. Your lips don’t actually get bigger unfortunately. The scent is amazing; like a luxurious, sweet cotton candy. Even though this is a gooey gloss, it does have staying power which surprised me. I wore this for hours without touch ups. I did wear a nude lip liner as I do with every lip product. I’m wearing the Fair-Medium version. This was just okay for me. I don’t think it’s something I would run out and buy but I’m thankful I got to try it out.",8 Apr 2024,Traditional Style Gloss,Ihatepms,Tilbury,Lip,No
Almost immediately working. That picture was less than a minute after applying. It smells so good too! The package is adorable and it is totally worth the price. Stings a little but not terrible,8 Apr 2024,Not too stingy!!,556mander,Tilbury,Lip,No
This new lip plumper by Charlotte Tilbury does not disappoint.  I received the Fair-Medium shade which is more of a light rosy brown shade that looks very natural on the lips.  I think it’s look amazing with the matching lip liner that I filled in my lips prior to applying the gloss.  There is a really nice sweet scent with a minty tingle.  I did notice minor plumping and my lips stayed hydrated even after the gloss wore off.  I loved that the gloss is smooth and not sticky. The packaging is very pretty and well made.  Worth purchasing if looking for a natural glossy lip look.,8 Apr 2024,"Natural, glossy and hydrating",christinem444,Tilbury,Lip,No

"Charlotte Tillbury's Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpasm Gloss in color Med/Deep is a great new addition to the Pillow Talk line. It makes my lips feel tingly and minty, both hot and cool at the same time, and it definitely makes my lips look fuller. I love that it contains hyaluronic acid to keep the lips moisturized (but I'm a little wary of whatever Collageneer is, as it doesn't sound cruelty-free). The packaging is a little extra; it features in relief a mouth with what is supposed to be a lipstick near its lips, but actually looks like it has a cigarette hanging out of its mouth.",8 Apr 2024,,kaitaloipa,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I recently tried the Charlotte Tilbury
Pillow Talk Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss in the color Pillow Talk Fair-Medium and I must say, I was highly impressed.

Great color for everyone! The applicator is nice but sometimes pulls out too much product. The gloss made my lips tingle but I didn’t see a plumping affect. I’ll still use the product because the color is so pretty and overall feels good on my lips. I was sent this product complimentary to review.,8 Apr 2024,Okay,jmmcel03,Tilbury,Lip,No
The tube is fantastic- albeit a tad bulky- it has a quilted appearance with a flashy set of gold lips - very extra! This plumper applies nicely and a sense of heat is evident as the lipgloss starts to tingle. It appears very shiny. Looked rather clear on my lips and provided a bit of an extra glowy-ness around my lip line. I did not notice major plumping but will continue to use and experiment with to see what the full range of looks can be.,8 Apr 2024,Nice gloss with minimal color,Malubulj,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I received the Charlotte Tilbury Big Lip Plumpgasm in Pillow Talk Fair-Medium for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. This is a lip-plumping lipgloss that comes in 2 universally flattering shades - Pillow Talk Fair-Medium is a pink nude, and Pillow Talk Medium-Deep is a brown berry pink.
I received the Fair-Medium shade which on my lips is a shimmery nude pink, which is close to my natural lip color. 
It features Sunflower Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and Hyaluronic Acid to nourish and hydrate lips. The plumping effect comes from Capsicum Fruitescens, which tingles once applied to the lips. 
The doe foot applicator makes it easy to apply to my lips. It has a slightly thicker consistency (compared to other lip gloss products) and smells a little like cake batter.
I like how the color looks natural, and I notice a slight plumping effect. It isn’t sticky and it keeps my lips moisturized and smooth. It isn’t super long lasting, plus the tingling doesn’t really bother me, but it is pretty expensive at $35, so not sure that I would purchase",8 Apr 2024,Pretty shade!,1SharonG,Tilbury,Lip,No
I’ve tried many lip plumpers but never Charlotte Tilbury. When I I first applied this one (and it especially being Pillow Talk color) I was sold.

"Alrighty, hold onto your hats 'cause we're diving into the wild world of lip plumpers! This lip plumper? Total rockstar! The tingle? It's like a little party on your lips, not too crazy, just enough to make 'em feel alive! And let's talk about the shade—gorgeous doesn't even cut it, it's like wearing a sunset on your lips! Plus, it's not sticky, so you won't be battling your hair on a windy day. But beware, it's like a ghost at a party—here one minute, gone the next! You'll be reapplying more often than you check your Insta feed. But hey, the color is poppin' and the texture is smoother than a baby's bottom. And guess what? No chapped lips afterward! As soon as it touches your lips, you'll feel the tingle, and while I was expecting it to be as runny as a marathon, it's just right. A dab will do ya, and the color payoff is worth every penny.

The tube is a little bit on the bigger side then I would like. It has a sweet scent to it. Can’t really put my finger on it. It glides on your lips. Applicator is soft and big, but it’s still angle to where you can get the lip outline. You get this like sensation of cold and hot. And the plump is noticeable definitely better than the other plumping glosses out there. It’s a little on the pricier side at about $40 but it’s works and the glazed finish is so good!

The product itself is stunning, I have thin lips and I’m always looking for things to make them look even a little bit plumper, and this gave me that effect.

I received this product for my honest review. The packaging is sleek and there's a lot of product in the tube. Definitely probably the most product I've seen in Charlotte Tilbury. There's no real scent. The texture is sheer. The plump is real.  I personally do not like that.  I love the color.  I just don't like the burning of the plumping.,7 Apr 2024,Plumping lip gloss,ELD28,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This lip gloss is long lasting and’s the texture is not too sticky. However, it did burn and it took a little over 10 minutes for it to cool down.. I don’t use lip plumpers so I’m not sure if that’s just how the product is to “plump” the lips. The color is beautiful and natural but because of the burning sensation I probably won’t be using this again.",7 Apr 2024,Burns,dorisciana,Tilbury,Lip,No
I love Charlotte Tilbury products so I had high expectations for the Pillow talk Big Lip Plumpgasm. Packaging and applicator are beautiful as always. The color is amazing and looks wonderful and natural. There’s a tingle when applied but it’s not uncomfortable. Unfortunately I noticed very little change in the size of my lips but it did have a moisturizing effect with a sexy shine that I did love.,6 Apr 2024,Gorgeous but not much plumping,jeepnjess,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I received the fair medium shade. Truthfully I didn’t see a difference in terms of plumping. I do think because of the shine and color, it did give the illusion of my lips looking full but when I compare my before and after pics of the gloss, there is literally no difference. The shine stays on well and looks great as a regular lip gloss. There is a tingly effect as well.",6 Apr 2024,Great gloss but no plump,gbeauty8,Tilbury,Lip,No

This lip gloss didn’t burn my mouth like other lip plumpers do. It has a nice minty tingly feeling. My fiancé didn’t complain when I kissed him lol. The color is called medium deep but it’s very similar to my natural lip color and sheer. It was nice layering it over a nude liquid lip for my cousins wedding,6 Apr 2024,Love,Briana510,Tilbury,Lip,No

The packaging is so cute and fun! This lip gloss is very glossy with a tint of color. This lip gloss gives a tingle feeling for up to an hour which gives a plumping effect. One star off because personally I’m not a fan of the tingle. The applicator is nice to use. It’s very soft and goes on nicely.,6 Apr 2024,,susielumpkins,Tilbury,Lip,No
I have little baby lips so any boost helps me out without adding needles to my face. This gloss does work but I had to mark it down because I have had better results with other plumping glosses.

I’d probably rather stick with her regular glosses over this one.,6 Apr 2024,Not a bad gloss but not much plumping.,PoeticKat,Tilbury,Lip,No

"As soon as you start applying, you can feel the tingling. I will say I was expecting to be so liquidy. It’s not a thick consistency gloss so you don’t need the brush to be fully covered. A little will cover your full lip. Color is really nice. There’s a slight plump for sure. And the tube design is fun.

"Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss in fair/medium is a great color. I personally love the pillow, talk line of colors, and it goes really well with my skin tone.

"I have found my new favorite lip gloss just in time for my birthday! I’m am absolutely in love with this gloss. The packaging it comes in it gorgeous and looks so sophisticated and sleek not to mention the gloss itself is chefs kiss! The gloss container comes in a thicker tube with the pillow embossed twist on handle with the eye catching rose gold TC embossed on the lid as well. The beautiful rose gold accents, especially the lips clutching the gloss and the clear view window to show the color/remaining amount is all nothing short of stunning. When using the gloss the lid/applicator will lock into place when twisting it all the way closed which I really like so you don’t have to worry that it will accidentally open if carried in a makeup bag or in your purse. Now for the best part, the gloss! Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm gloss has heat + ice technology, hyaluronic acid and collageneer and let me tell you it absolutely brings the tingle effect! Within seconds of applying you will feel the tingly icy/warm effect of the gloss but in no way does it hurt, I personally love the feeling and think it feels pretty neat. The feeling doesn’t last the whole time you wear just for the first 10 minutes or so. The gloss is very hydrating and long lasting so you won’t have to reapply constantly which is very nice and it gives the 3D optical illusion glazed finish. It is beautiful! It goes on silky smooth and stay very silky smooth throughout wear leaving your lips feeling hydrated and amazingly soft each wear. The texture is very smooth and silky. It doesn’t have a light scent which I personally think smells a little like brownies but that’s just me, it is a very soft subtle, sweet scent. I would say that this gloss is worth every single penny and I can’t wait to get it in every shade! Highly recommended from this girly!",6 Apr 2024,My new favorite gloss hands down!,jessdawn18,Tilbury,Lip,No

"Charlotte Tilbury has done it again! This gorgeous color in the classic “Pillow Talk” is stunning on the lips. The packaging is heavy, and much larger (in a good way!) than I was expecting. The texture is not sticky on the lips and does have a light tingling while it’s working its magic. I did half my lips in the first photo, after 5 minutes then after 10 minutes across both sides of lips. I could see and feel the difference! It’s crazy! Most others I’ve tried I was not confident with or the tingling would bother me after several minutes and I would need to wipe it off. The color in the bottle looks much darker than when it is on your lips. But I did this without a color beneath to show the full effect of the product. 10/10 recommend!",6 Apr 2024,WOW,hannahrawr,Tilbury,Lip,No

I really like the color but it doesn't last longer than 2 hours with normal eating and drinking so make sure to bring it with you to reapply.

"• Though the color looks dark in the bottle & on the applicator, it went on with just a soft pop of color which I really liked! I do feel like the applicator had a bit too much of the gloss on it & wasn't easy to control the amount being put on very well, like there was too much of it being applied every time & too wet. Now I've never really had a lip gloss that promotes plumping actually plump my lips that I could tell. If it does, it is ever so slight & maybe more if you use a lip exfoliator beforehand. To me it had a soft, sweet scent to it and I did get that tingly feeling in my lips after application that was not irritating. I do feel after regular use my lips did feel more healthy & soft, but I honestly don't feel like regular use kept my lips any plumper than they already are. I still really enjoyed this product & I would buy it.",6 Apr 2024,Lovely gloss / balm.,popscene01,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I've been on the hunt for the perfect lip gloss that not only plumps but also hydrates, and I finally found it in Charlotte's iconic Pillow Talk Plumping Gloss. From the moment I applied it, I could feel the innovative heat + ice technology working its magic. Unlike other plumping glosses I've tried, there was no uncomfortable burn or sting, just a refreshing, tingling sensation that made my lips feel invigorated and plump.

The gloss itself is a beautiful balance between the hydrating comfort of a balm and the glossy finish I love. The hyaluronic acid and other lip-loving ingredients in the formula are a game-changer for me. They hydrate and smooth my lips so effectively that I can feel the difference even after the gloss has worn off. It's like a hydration treatment and a cosmetic product all in one.

"My first impression was that the packaging is luxurious, very beautiful. The color is beautiful and matches perfectly with my lips tone, as it is a very natural nude. I don't like plump effect in glosses because of the tingling to be honest but  I really liked this product because the tingling is not too strong and it doesn't bother me as much others.",5 Apr 2024,,Geshica,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I have become a huge charlotte tilbury fan recently thanks to Influenster send me some of their products lately. This instantly became my favorite lip plumper of ALL TIME! First, the packaging is stunning, very luxury and high end. The gloss is so smooth and smells amazing like cupcakes. I got the shade medium deep and wow what a stunning color! Not too dark for my light olive skin, it looks PERFECT. Once you apply it using the awesome doe foot applicator, you instantly start to feel the heat and ice technology in it. Reminds you of mint, but the gloss smells like cupcakes which it wonderful! It doesn’t burn of sting and is gentle yet effective. The gloss it thick but had a great iridescent color and stays put and wears wonderfully.

I had to review this honestly and transparently. I absolutely adore this brand and was so excited when I found out I would be receiving plumpgasm.. unfortunately the product did not live up to the hype I had set in my head. For a plumping gloss I did not feel like it was effective compared to brands that share the same price point. The color is very milky pink verging on clear and the lipgloss as a whole doesn’t offer anything different from its competitors. On a positive note the packaging is absolutely beautiful and the product is not tacky like many other glosses. It offers comfort if you’re sensitive to plumping and has a long lasting shine.,5 Apr 2024,Not effective,IYGBoBeauty,Tilbury,Lip,No

This is my first time trying a lip plumper lip gloss and I didn’t know what to expect but this was rather chill but I also only used a little bit. I like the brown tint.

"The cutest packaging this nude gloss has the perfect hue. Just the right amount of tingle to plump your lips. The doe foot applicator allows the gloss to glide over your lips, creating the perfect pout. I would rate the tingle factor a 5. It’s definitely mild compared to other plumping glosses I have tried. The color is perfect. Just a hue darker than my natural lip color and pairs well with a nice liner, making this a great color for every day use or a night on the town. It’s not too sticky and wears well through the day. My lips felt hydrated and nourished. A welcome addition to any makeup collection.",5 Apr 2024,,RAddison,Tilbury,Lip,No

"This gloss is nicer than I thought it would be. I’m normally skeptic about plumping glosses because I feel they generally dry my lips out, however, this one does not. This one smells like cake, but not in an annoying way, the scent is subtle in my opinion. There is a tingle effect and I feel like it lasts for about 20 or 30 minutes depending on how much you put on. I got the darker shade and it’s really really pretty. The color looks like a Rosie nude with purple undertones. The packaging is really cute, a little goes along way. I do feel that the lip gloss fades away quicker than others, if I drink anything or eat anything, I basically need to reapply right after.",5 Apr 2024,"Rosie nude, non drying, tingle lips!",hotpinklips,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I received this for free in exchange for my honest review. 

I didn’t think too much about this product until I tried it and my lips started to sting. I thought I was maybe allergic to it until I read the product description again and found out it is supposed to offer a sting-free and burn-free ice/hot sensation. Well it did not. It stings and burns. 

I tried this for consecutive days to see if it gets any better but it doesn’t. The first day was the worst and now I’m slightly used to it but i don’t think the feeling is worth it. 

The lipstick is very moisturizing though and even though the product color looked dark it actually applied on pretty clear and has a slight shine to it. I don’t think it made my lips plumper though.",5 Apr 2024,,xxjacxx,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This review is for Dark version of CT plumping lip gloss. The packaging is gorgeous, no complaints there. The doefoot applicator is very comfortable and easy to apply the gloss with, much improved from her previous horrible inversed heart applicator. The gloss inside looks dark brown and smells like chocolate. It goes nicely on the lips and has a shiny glossy finish with minimal color on the lips. It starts to tingle immediately and progresses to burning within a few seconds. I think it feels like liquid hot peppers, way too much! My lips didn't get any plumper, but I got very irritated by this product and had to remove it after just a couple minutes on my lips. It's pretty revolting and unbearable to tolerate. Do NOT kiss your significant other or God forbid, your child, with this stuff on. You'll burn their skin.",5 Apr 2024,Big bunch of nope in gorgeous packaging,tagerosan,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I chose to try the medium/deep color and I was afraid that it might be a little too dark for my complexion, but I was pleasantly surprised that it looked really pretty and not too dark with my skin tone.  This gloss has a large doe foot applicator.  It’s soft and doesn’t pull and the gloss goes on smoothly and feels nice on the lips.  It’s not sticky and is comfortable.  Does it actually plump?  Not as far as I’m concerned, but the shine gives the appearance of an enhancing plump.  It has a minty cooling effect as opposed to a cinnamon red hot heat, which I loved.  

You can put a thicker layer on for a bigger color payoff, but like any lip gloss, it tends to pool towards your bottom lip leaving a sheer finish towards the center of your lip 
and a line of more opaque color along the border of your bottom lip, so I like to keep it to one thin layer for a sheerer color.",5 Apr 2024,"Pretty color, but does it plump?",sandeeyo,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Love this new plumping gloss from charlotte tilbury! I usually avoid plumping gloss as I hate the way the stinging makes my lips feel. This one is lighter almost minty feeling closer to buxom glosses, but a little less intense. It’s a really beautiful color, a large wand for application, and a generous size. When the e gloss wears off my lips felt soft and moisturized. A definite recommend!",5 Apr 2024,Great new gloss!,Gidget28,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I know this sounds dramatic, but this is probably the best lip product I've ever owned. Simply due to the hydration and how long it lasts. Most lip products look great at first but then my lips feel chapped again after 20mins to max an hour. My lips were still hydrating and smooth feeling 6 hours later! Did my lips look plumper? Immediately, sure. But gloss will do that but I am simply amazing at the hydration my lips felt for so long. It does tingle at first and smells really great!

"The color of this gloss is so beautiful, soft and natural looking. The gloss itself is a bit sticky but nothing that is annoying to wear. The tingling is a bit intense for a plumping gloss and starts almost immediately after touching the wand to your lips. It isn’t painful but it is definitely noticeable. I actually don’t notice much plumping at all with this gloss, which is why I knocked it down one star. I think this is a great gloss on its own but this isn’t something I would buy or reach for if I wanted plump looking lips. Love the packaging, super cute and luxe feeling.

It has a super soft applicator, which Durant pick up too much not too little of the product. The packaging is to die for! It’s the perfect  pink with pops of gold! What’s not to like?! For me, it was the plumping effect! Literally everything else about this gloss is glam, except that one thing! I would buy this continuously and wear it DAILY if it didn’t burn the snot out of my lips! I honestly felt like I had been sucking on the end of a Vicks tube!

"This is an absolutely beautiful lipgloss color. It’s definitely a perfect pinky nude for me. The gloss itself is very spicy though since it is a plumping gloss. I think it’s more spicy than other ones I’ve tried so I would just be careful if youre sensitive to that.

"I received this product from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury as an incentive for my honest opinion. I have one word to sum up how I feel about this product, OBSESSED!!! It’s so good! It doesn’t burn at all there’s a slight warming sensation then it turns into a cooling sensation and it lingers for about 30 mins but it’s not overwhelming at all! I actually really enjoy the feeling. The color is PERFECT! It’s a beautiful nude color that will compliment most skin tones. It’s also VERY pigmented which is amazing. There’s a slight vanilla scent and it smells absolutely delicious. The gloss it’s self isn’t really sticky or uncomfortable at all. It feels really good and hydrating on your lips and it gives you a beautiful plump to your lips without the crazy burning sensation (unlike other lip plumpers I’ve tried in the past). I’m in love with the packaging as well! It’s beautiful and unlike any lipgloss packaging I’ve ever seen. It feels and looks very luxurious and I feel so fancy when I pull it out my purse to use it. I HIGHLY recommend this brand and product to anyone who wants a beautiful gloss with a plumping effect. I will definitely repurchase this product when I run out!",5 Apr 2024,I’m OBSESSED!!,NinaLizette333,Tilbury,Lip,No

I love the medium-deep color of the gloss as I do prefer a darker tint. I feel like the color was a nice complement to my skin tone. The glossy part was nice and smooth and not at all sticky feeling. The applicator allowed it go apply really smoothly and evenly. 
In regard to the the plumping…. I have used it for a few days and honestly don’t notice a visual difference today or any other day prior. I do get the lip sensation of the “tingle” that comes with a plumper however. The feeling is a fresh feeling, like after you brush your teeth or use a minty mouthwash.

I like the tube and applicator. The packaging is also super cute. The consistency is good- not too thick and I like the color. Looks darker out of the bottle than when applied on my lips. I’m giving 3 stars because this feels like a thousand hot needles piercing/stinging my lips when I apply. It’s almost scary cos I’m not sure if I should be worried. I’ve applied twice to give a thorough review and to verify the effect it’s had but I’m very cautious to apply anymore. The stinging continues for 20-30 minutes then it starts to reduce after about 35 minutes. My lips do appear soft and plump for 5 hrs at least.

"The Charlotte Tilbury Lip Plumper gloss in the shade 'pillow talk' has quickly become a staple in my makeup collection. I have tried many lip plumpers in the past that have done nothing, but I have to say, Charlotte Tilbury knocked this one out the park! 

First off, upon opening, it is a beautiful & uniquely made, high-quality packaging, with a cute lips logo on there. The application is also perfect, providing just the right amount of product without being too messy.  The gloss has a smooth and creamy texture that glides on effortlessly, making it perfect for everyday wear. The color is a gorgeous muted rosy nude that complements my skin tone perfectly. I immediately felt a tingling sensation on my lips. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but rather a subtle plumping sensation. I could see a noticeable difference in the fullness of my lips within minutes. 

What I love most about this lip plumping gloss is that it not only enhances my natural lip shape, but it also adds a hint of fullness and volume. It's like a non-invasive lip filler in a tube! One of the main ingredients in this gloss is hyaluronic acid, which is known for its hydrating and plumping properties. I have also noticed that my lips feel more moisturized and smoother after using this product. I have received many compliments on my lips since using this gloss.

The best part is that it doesn't dry out my lips like some other plumping products do. Instead, it leaves them feeling hydrated and nourished thanks to the nourishing ingredients such as coconut oil and shea butter. 

Additionally, I also appreciate that it is cruelty-free and made with natural ingredients, which is a huge plus for me. 

The only downside to this product is that it is a bit on the pricier side, but I believe it is worth the investment. A little goes a long way and the results make it worth the price.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this lip plumping gloss to anyone looking for fuller and more hydrated lips.",4 Apr 2024,A must-have,Beautyjunkie199,Tilbury,Lip,No
"My favorite thing about the Charlotte Tilbury lipgloss is definitely the tube it is beautiful then when you open the package you get the most luxurious chocolate smell, which makes you definitely want to try the gloss. Once I applied the gloss I did feel a tingly sensation as you do with all pumping glasses, I felt that the texture of it was reminiscent of a lip oil, and it had just the right amount of pigmentation for a nude look, not super opaque.

"As someone who loves a natural yet glamorous look, I was thrilled at the chance to try the Pillow Talk by Charlotte Tilbury Lip Gloss! First impression….
💋True magic for anyone looking to enhance their lips without a needle! The fair-medium shade complements various skin tones + provides subtle pop of color that's perfect for everyday without looking too overdone.
💋plumping effect = noticeable but not overpowering, giving my lips a fuller appearance w/o discomfort. 
💋Plus, formula = enriched with nourishing ingredients (hyaluronic acid, peptides, etc.) leaving my lips feeling hydrated and smooth. WIN-WIN-WIN!!!

🫦Only downside is it may require reapplication throughout day to maintain plumping effect. However, the smooth packaging makes it easy to touch up on the go.

I tried this Charlotte Tilbury lip plumper and did not like it. It was a very uncomfortable sensation that actuallu felt like fire on my face. It's a no for me. I did receive this product free in exchange for my honest review from Influenster.,4 Apr 2024,Nope!,MamaKula,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Pretty good for a lip plumper! Shine lasts and there is a fuller noticeable difference. The gloss is spicy, burns a lil more than lip injector gloss and fenty heat but the after effect is awesome",4 Apr 2024,Cheaper than filler!,lizard801,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I always thought that this brand is just blown up, hyped up but from the experience I can safely say that it isn’t the truth. The lipgloss was made with “plumpgasm” heat and ice technology with added hyaluronic acid and collageneer. It will plump up the lips with long lasting hydration and it will add a 3D optical illusion to the lips. Easy to use, just glide over lips with the wand. I really enjoy the scent, it reminds me of the chocolate. And the heating effect is absolutely amazing and I love how it feels.",4 Apr 2024,I love this,Maryserbia,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I’ve never quite found a lip plumper that worked well without burning or making my lips sting. This lip plumper is an exception!  It feels nice and cooling on and dang does it make your lips look smooth and plump. It’s honestly the best lip plumper I’ve ever used. The packaging is also hefty and gorgeous. The only thing I didn’t love is once it’s been on for a while it leaves a light tackiness like a stain, but I don’t care because it makes my lips look like I got filler! Thanks to Influenster for sending me this free for my honest review!",4 Apr 2024,Holy crap amazing,lomichelle91,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Beautiful gloss in a beautiful package. This delivers a shine that works well with any makeup look. I can’t say I really noticed a plumping effect but I did feel the capsaicin causing a tingling effect when applied which I thought was stronger than other plumping glosses I’ve tried. Great if you’re looking for a pillow talk gloss, I’d look elsewhere if you want more plumping.",4 Apr 2024,Great gloss and shine!,darksalamander,Tilbury,Lip,No
Very cute packaging. It is easy to apply and comes in a really nice shade. It seems to work well and the feel of the tingle is preferable to other products.,4 Apr 2024,Cute packaging and not too harsh,angieundead,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I received Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss complimentary for my honest review.

I am a big fan of Charlotte Tilbury cosmetics so jumped at the chance to be able to try her Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip gloss. The lip gloss comes in the cutest packaging with little gold lips on the container. It looks very luxurious. The pillow talk color Med-Deep is a very neutral muted brownish/berry color that looks darker in the tube than on. It is very sheer and super glossy and looks great alone or over a lip liner or lipstick.  I think it would work great with many different skin tones given how neutral it is.  The lipgloss tingles when you apply and the plumping effect was long lasting.  Overall, this is a great, high-shine gloss!",4 Apr 2024,Super Shiny Plumped Lips,sflm,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I received this magnificent Liostick like a gift from Influenster & Sephora and I must say that in my first test I saw the results, the lipstick is for the effect of full lips, leaving an itchy sensation for said effect. It has a large applicator that makes it easier to use. The size is super good, it seems small but it is actually wide.

"I really like this! The plumping effect has a slight tingle, but not burning like most. The color is lovely and the texture is soft and slick without being sticky! I also like that it’s not a bold color, it’s a MLBB shade. The tube is large, the “quilted” stamping on the top is cute.

I’d like to start by saying the packaging is super cute. Makes you feel like you purchased something special. Now the feel of this lipgloss is great it’s not over stingy or burning. It’s super shiny and smooth not sticky. The color I received is not really my favorite it doesn’t look that great on me. It’s  too orangey.,4 Apr 2024,Ok product beautiful packaging,Cindybst,Tilbury,Lip,No

"Before I begin this review I am obligated to inform you that this review is ""Incentivized"" I received these products in exchange for my most honest review:

I have reviewed many lip plumpers! In most cases there is a spicy, burning sensation that ranges in intensity; some hurting more then others and most are a sticky formula. 

This is not what I encountered with the pillow talk big lip plumpgasm. In fact I’m not sure I will ever use another brand again! The formula is buttery and not greasy or sticky or overly thick. 

Rather than the uncomfortable burning sensation I was pleasantly surprised to feel a cooling sensation instead! I am a light neutral skin tone and the medium deep was beautiful! My lips are naturally a deeper color and even darker as my skin meets the summer sun.

I experienced no sensations of discomfort, redness, intense scent or fragrance, or an allergic reaction! I do infact love this plumping formula.",4 Apr 2024,Lux,,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Girl, lemme tell you this made my lips plump I’m not lying, I love it and it does have a small tingle nothing major but it’s awesome and it makes me look beautiful!, the scent is very light the color is perfect! I’ll be wearing this all the time!",4 Apr 2024,I love this!!!,RamblinnMa,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Whew! The icy tingle hits right away with this one! The packaging  is absolutely gorgeous, I feel so fancy pulling it out of my purse! The medium/deep color was a darker berry color and a little really goes a long way!",4 Apr 2024,Love it!,ayeefilthy,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I wanted to like this lip plump. But to be honest I didn’t notice any (visible) difference that would justify using this versus a regular lip gloss. I mean, it does look super nice, with a nice subtle color that is shiny without it being too excessive. But I’m not sure if I want to get through the whole tingling refreshing sensation of the plumping effect. Anyway, it does look pretty cool, the color is great, the package is nice, I will probably keep using while I still have it.",4 Apr 2024,,gabizago,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I have been a huge fan of Charlotte Tilbury’s makeup products, so I was EXTREMELY excited to try out the new Pillow Talk (Medium Deep) Big Lip Plumpgasm lip gloss.  This is a plumping lip gloss that claims to provide a power plump and long-lasting hydration. The size of the plumping lip gloss is 0.18 fl. oz. I have tried plumping lip gloss in the past, so I was thrilled to try out this product.  Initially, I noticed the packaging of this lip gloss.  It looks luxurious with a pink and gold outer layer.  The lip gloss’s top looks like a pillow design, and the middle has a gold emblem with a “lip gloss” sticking out of a mouth.  With the name of the lip gloss, I was skeptical of what the packaging was going to look like, but it is not offensive to the eye.  The consumer also has the ability to view the color of the lip gloss shade because there is a clear view at the bottom of the lip gloss that showcases the color.  With being a Tan/Deep African-American female, I was looking forward to seeing how this color would look on my skin complexion.  This color did not disappoint! It looked like my natural lip color with a slight berry/pink color payoff.  I didn’t feel like I needed a lip liner with this lip gloss, so I wore it by itself.  This lip gloss does have a slight tingle feeling, but it’s not overbearing or painful.  This “feeling” helps to plump of the lips.  After a few seconds of having this lip gloss on, I could tell that my lips looked slightly plumper.  Also, this lip gloss did not have a smell, which is something that I look for when searching for a new lip gloss.  I don’t like lip glosses that have an intense smell because it can be overpowering. Additionally, I loved that this lip gloss was not sticky.  It did not leave a sticky texture/consistency nor white residue while I communicating with my family and friends.  To me, the consistency was smooth and hydrating. Lastly, this lip gloss has a big doe foot applicator, which is perfect for my lips.",4 Apr 2024,Review of the Charlotte Tilbury Big Lip Plumpgasm,courtneyg1107,Tilbury,Lip,No
"The packaging alone is sooooooo sic!!!! It looks cool, heavy duty packaging. First off when u open the item, the wand is extreme, feels your lips in one swipe!

"I really enjoyed this lip gloss. It felt similarly to icy hot, which was an interesting sensation. The fair medium color was really pretty on me and the gloss felt nice as it was not too sticky. The only reason why I’m not giving five stars is because I truly do not like the name. Who wants to refer someone to this product with a name like this?!",4 Apr 2024,Terrible branding,aashleynicole,Tilbury,Lip,No

I picked the dark shade than my usual shade and thought it’s going to be very dark. I applied it over all my lip products as a last lip product and I wasn’t disappointed. It gives a very nice finish without being sticky and color is not way too dark. It doesn’t burn and definitely plump your lips without looking too dramatic. Pick the right shade and give it a try.,4 Apr 2024,,Arshuuuuuuu,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I’m a huge fan of Charlotte Tilbury products and was over the moon when I received this new Pillow Talk lip plumping gloss. I chose the medium-deep color as I wanted a little bit of a tint on my lips and as you can see in the second photo it’s a nice neutral every day shade. The tube is big and luxurious in pink and gold. The applicator is sturdy yet easy to work with. The texture is like a thicker gloss, which I love because of its better staying power. This lipgloss works with a new ice/heat technology to plump the lips, so no peppermint smell or cinnamon taste but a delicate vanilla/cake batter scent and taste, very delicious to be honest. There was a slight tingle, but no burn, I could definitely feel something was happening within my lips. They looked smooth, shiny and plump without having a ‘fake’ appearance. My husband noticed right away and loved it! I’ve been using it daily since receiving it as I feel it leaves my lips nice and soft at the end of the day. If you’re in the market for a new lip plumper please give this a try! I’d definitely recommend it :)",4 Apr 2024,Absolutely beautiful!,NickiLee33,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I recently tried the Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss in the Fair-Med shade and I am absolutely in love with it! The color is a perfect nude-pink that complements my skin tone beautifully. 
Not only does this lip gloss provide a gorgeous pop of color, but it also gives my lips a plump, glossy finish that lasts for hours. I love how it tingles slightly upon application, giving my lips a full and pillowy look.
The formula is also non-sticky and lightweight, making it incredibly comfortable to wear throughout the day. I have received so many compliments on my lips while wearing this gloss and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for the perfect plumping lip gloss.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and will definitely be purchasing in the future.",4 Apr 2024,,CynthiaPoncev,Tilbury,Lip,No

I am a HUGE Charlotte Tilbury fan and I was super excited to receive this. It’s such a flattering shade and lovely lip formula that tingles but not overwhelms. It’s not dark at all as I expected. It literally becomes my natural lip shade. I didn’t see much of a difference in terms plumping mg lips but it wore as a pretty lip gloss. It didn’t feel sticky. The packaging is cute but the name is kinda played out now. Other brands have used these types of names and honestly- I want to feel beautiful not sexualized. Either way- my other criticism of this lip product is that a lot of product comes out at once-so beware when pulling out the applicator.,4 Apr 2024,I enjoy this!,ohmymichie,Tilbury,Lip,No

"On the lips, this lip plumper feels and looks quite comfortable. It smells nice, like candy, and isn't at all sticky. Applying it immediately causes a tingling sensation.

"I was already in love with the Pillow Talk Medium lipstick (the original pulls orange on me). This was a delectable surprise and the medium deep shade suits my skin tone. It appears more sheer upon application than the color in the tube but looks beautiful alone (as shown in the product pic) or paired with a brown lip liner (as shown in the selfie). I love the plumping technology because it feels like icy hot instead of hot pepper like some other lip plumpers do. You can feel it working but it’s not uncomfortable. The doe foot wand is tapered at the end so that you can get your upper lip super defined upon application. It is also larger than a typical wand so it picks up a lot of product but I find that I don’t have to double dip to cover my lips. It’s infused with hyaluronic acid, which gives it a super smooth feel on the lips that never feels sticky or gloopy. Overall the component is bigger than most other glosses and has a funky embossed mouth in gold along with a faux cushion texture. It’s a bit gaudy but I like the product inside so I can overlook that. I have found myself using this on the daily as my go to lip gloss because it looks great on its own, with lip liner, or on top of your favorite lipstick.",4 Apr 2024,OBSESSED!,perfectlyyou,Tilbury,Lip,No
I just love this lipgloss. How cute is the packaging? I love it. The shade is very pretty. The texture is a bit thick. After applying you do feel a bit of a tingling sensation but it’s tolerable.

"I don’t usually use any type of lip plump cosmetics but I couldn’t say no to this! Firstly, this smells so good and I love the doe-foot applicator! When first applying it, it went on smooth and then I felt this light cooling/burning sensation! Lol it didn’t really “burn” but I’m sure you know what I mean! That affect didn’t last too long and to be honest I do see a bit of difference in my lips. I got the fair-medium and I think it’s nice!

"I received this free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury for my honest opinion.This Big Lip Plump Gasm comes in a little pink box and the tube the gloss comes in is cute and unique I no im not going to wanna throw it out once it's gone. Tgot shade medium deep which is a pinkish brown tint, it has a kinda sweet scent, is non sticky and is made with a heat and ice technology that I think is also unique because it does sting but also has a cooling effect too so the stinging isn't overwhelming and both sensations die down after a few minutes. It's also made with Hyaluronic acid to help keep lips moisturized, and Collageneer that I'm assuming helps plump lips. I really like the way this makes my lips look fuller and added a little color with the shine automatically enhancing your natural lips.",4 Apr 2024,Love the fire and ice feeling this gives my lips,Amandap83,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This pillow talk big lip plumpgasm on the shade of medium-deep definitely works. The way on how I'm going to describe how it feels on my lips was like very cooling, icy, hot minty and a little  tingly feeling. I have tan skin, so the way it looks on my lips is just glossy and plump. The tingling and icy hoy feeling lasted for 40 minutes max based on my experience and what I experienced. I do think the price is reasonable since it's good for 12 months after opening. It definitely gave me the plump lips and glossy look. Would I recommend it?

"The packaging of this plumping gloss is GORGEOUS. The scent is a warm vanilla scent. The texture is a super creamy gloss that glides on effortlessly. It is the perfect pink nude shade. The instant hot/tingly sensation you get with plumping glosses is quickly paired with a super cooling affect which was really nice. Both of which are long lasting. As for the plumping, I didn’t experience an actual plumping affect like I have with other plumping glosses.

This was just ok. I did not like the medium-deep color. It was too dark and I am a darker Fitzpatrick so I was expecting it to be flattering. It tasted/felt like I had cayenne pepper on my lips. Which I can handle because I’m fine with spicy but if you don’t like spicy things then this probably won’t be for you. Curious to see how the lighter colored one will look like on others.

"Pillow Talk Big Lip Plump Gasm by Charlotte Tilbury in the color Fair-Medium is an absolute game changer for those of us with thinner lips. This lip gloss is lightly tinted in a pinkish tint that is super light, just enough to give it a tiny pop of color. The coolest thing happens when you put it on, instantly you get a tingly feeling and you know its working! You can feel it start to slightly tingle the edges of your lips as it plumps and works its magic. This gloss has hyaluronic acid for hydration, its own collagener technology for the high gloss, and its own blend of plumpers that create the heat and ice effect that plumps your lips. The claim is that this will help repair your lips in time, I have been using this gloss for well over a week now, and I can say that my lips do feel smoother and more hydrated, so the claim is likely on point. This is a luxury gloss, made for those who want the very best for their lips. Its a good buy and I am here for it!",4 Apr 2024,big plumping!,dawnam,Tilbury,Lip,No
This plumping lip gloss is amazing! You can feel the plumping start to work as soon as you put it on. It's such a pretty color and lasts a lot longer than other plumping glosses I have tried before. The packaging is so fun and cute as well!,4 Apr 2024,Really pretty!,aduis,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This Charlotte Tilbury lip gloss was just launched on the Charlotte Tilbury App and I'm so thrilled to be one of the first to try it out. Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss comes in 2 different universal shades - a Fair/Medium shade in a nude pink and a Medium/Deep in a berry brown. I was sent the Medium/Deep and thought for sure it would be too dark, but it actually is even better than a pink shade. It's said to hydrate the lips - which is definitely does. It gives a high shine with more of a mauve color to my lips that really accentuates them. I can feel a slight tingle when it's first applied but it goes away quickly. It's so easy to apply with the diamond tip applicator.  Even when the gloss starts to wear off, you still have a light pigment that remain on the lips. It's a great formula.The packaging is so adorable, too.

I am very impressed with this plumping lip gloss! It burns a bit when you first apply it but man did it do its job and plump up my lips!! I’m very impressed. Usually lip plumping products don’t do much to my lips but Charlotte Tilbury delivered! Love it!! Love the glossy look and it’s not too sticky which is a plus for me.  I hate sticky lip glosses.,4 Apr 2024,Amazing!!,Steph1985,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This is my new favourite lip gloss! At first when I opened it up, I thought the medium-deep shade was going to be way too dark for me. It looks like a deep brown in the tube. Upon application it’s more sheer and has a nice my-lips-but-better look. It also has a very nice shine and isn’t sticky at all. The plumping effect is subtle and doesn’t burn like some plumping glosses, in fact it has almost an icy cooling feeling. Overall I really loved this gloss and would absolutely buy it for myself.",4 Apr 2024,Love!,whatwhaaat,Tilbury,Lip,No

"This is the first product I’ve tried from Charlotte Tilbury and it definitely won’t be the last! I love the shade of this lip plumping gloss as well as the consistency; often they are too slippery or too sticky, but this one is just right. It does make my lips tingle, as it should, but it’s not bothersome. More importantly, it does help plump up my lips a bit. I highly recommend this product and would definitely purchase it in the future.",4 Apr 2024,Works well!,MoMayer,Tilbury,Lip,No
This color is absolutely gorgeous! It goes on smoothly and is very hydrating. I love how it plumps my lips!,4 Apr 2024,I love how it plumps my lips!,AMucci,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I was gifted this to review. I absolutely love it! Personally, I do love the tingle from a good plumping gloss. This doesn’t really have that same tingle, with claims of burn free, but there is a cooling effect to it. I wouldn’t call it a tingle so much. Love the feel. It definitely gives a nice plump to my lips! And the applicator is really neat. I wipe off the excess inside the mouth of the tube and apply, and the applicator makes it so easy and applies so smoothly with the perfect layer. The color I have is pillow talk fair medium, and it’s a gorgeous neutral toned pinky beige. The packaging is another thing I love about this. It’s a really neat design with the golden lips on the package, and the iconic pink color of the package is so pretty.",4 Apr 2024,Icy cool plumping effect,vivaladoc,Tilbury,Lip,No
This plumping lip gloss is easy to apply with the applicator and the shade Fair-Med gives my lips a nice natural color. The lip gloss goes on very smoothly and has a nice lightweight texture and does not leave my lips feeling sticky. I love how this lip gloss has a nice light plumping effect without any dryness or a stinging sensation once applied. I love to wear this lip gloss by itself or over a lipstick for added plumpness. I really like that it keeps my lips feeling soft and hydrated with the skin nourishing ingredients.

"This lip plump from CT did not disappoint! I was a bit afraid that the shade might be too dark for my complexion but it was not a case at all! It gently tinted my lips but did not really have any strong pigment. It did give me some strong tingles though! It does not have any scent in my opinion, neither the taste as well. It gave my lips a beautiful healthy glow and plump. I love it!",4 Apr 2024,Very good lip plump!,Patipitts1,Tilbury,Lip,No
This gloss is a tingly plumper and does not turn my lips red with irritation. Love that! The color is actually true to what’s advertised. It looks great with a liner and wears well. I like the doe foot but honestly the rest of the packaging is too much.,4 Apr 2024,,churroro,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I personally don’t see a difference. I can definitely feel the heat, almost burning like after I eat something spicy. I don’t feel the ice, cooking effect. I like the product as a gloss but not too crazy about it as plumper.",4 Apr 2024,,MaryJane8005,Tilbury,Lip,No
I would consider the shade to be more of a pinkish brown than a brown berry. The plumping it subtle and does not hurt at all. It feels more like menthol than hot and spicy like the typical plumping gloss. It is not drying at all. Not sure on the plumping effect since I already have fuller lips.,4 Apr 2024,,alliexgator,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I received the Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm in shade Pillow Talk Medium Deep for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. This product has a gloss consistency and it lived up to its claim! The plumping effect was pretty visible. About 5 minutes after application, my lips reached the most plumped effect. It tingled a little bit, but it was not unbearable. This color specifically was gorgeous! This gloss is unscented. The packaging is beautifully designed. I highly recommend this product",4 Apr 2024,The BEST plumping effect I’ve experienced!,Giannina24,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I really love this plumping gloss. It smells really good, but isn’t overpowering. The packaging is also really cute! I love the applicator on it as well, it makes for an easy application. It’s a creamy texture and is well-pigmented! Now, for the effectiveness: this product does have a slight plumping effect. I would prefer a little more plump but im hoping if I continue to use it overtime, the plump effect will increase. It does have a slight tingle to it when first applied that lasts about 10-15 minutes. It also has a unique heat and ice technology that I definitely noticed, my lips feel warm and then cool. Really unique sensation! Other lip plumpers I’ve tried sting so much that I have to remove them but that wasn’t the case for this product. I mostly love the ingredients that this gloss has. The hyaluronic acid helps keep my lips hydrated for a long time, as this product is long-lasting. Overall, I definitely recommend this product. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes but all opinions are my own.",4 Apr 2024,Love this plumping gloss,VivaLaBlanc,Tilbury,Lip,No
It does feel like you rubbed your lips with a spicy pepper. If you are not a fan of that feeling then this is not for you. The burning sensation does wear off.

"I’m a big fan of Charlotte Tilbury already but she has completely outdone herself with her recent products in particular this amazingly beautiful lip plumping gloss! First of all it is a gorgeous packaging!! The detail is fantastic! It’s quite weighty, not cheap feeling by any means. There appears to be a good amount of product inside. The color is stunning in the classic medium pillow talk shade. It’s got a little cooling sensation at first then it does gradually intensify to a slight burning sensation but nowhere near the bee venom type of plumping glosses. I feel like it spreads to the outer edges of the lips rather than the center which definitely helps the lips to look fuller! You can line your lips and apply and just have a beautiful wash of color or use it over lipstick. It’s beautiful on its own. I have a rather small mouth with a thin top lip but I do notice a difference after about 5-10 minutes. I haven’t had any issues with feathering or something. It stays on the lip area very well. If you have a more mature mouth I’d say line first just to be safe. Definitely a keeper in the CT collection!!",4 Apr 2024,A YESSS!!,Kalasmom3,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I received this to try from Influenster for my honest review. This lipgloss is beautiful on the lips because it gives a great shine. The color is a deep pink mauve but once applied on the lips it’s clear. It also plumps your lips which you feel your lips cool with a tingly sensation. The packaging is also beautiful, unique and heavy duty which I liked that you can see the color inside as well. 💋💄",4 Apr 2024,,Evelyn2399,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I'm not a lippies kind of girl because I have thin lips lol but the concept of a plumper was intriguing and I figured I'd give it a try and see if it helped fill my lips out a bit... it smells like chocolate and the consistency of it is great, so is the shade... Even so, I'm not a fan lol it burns like crazy and didn't visually plump my lips at all... Not worth the pain in my opinion lol might be useful to someone else tho!",4 Apr 2024,Not for me...,tara5288,Tilbury,Lip,No

I am obsessed with Charlotte Tilbury. However, I can't always afford her products as a pro make up artist, needing a full kit. I was so excited to get this in PR. The quality does not miss❗️ From the packaging to the smell and texture and plumping this lip product is amazing 🥰 yes it does sting a little bit on the lip, but that is what makes them look more plump and it doesn't last very long.

"I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest feedback. The Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lips Gloss is in my favorite shade, nude.

I like to use a little lipliner then complete my look with this lip gloss. The container is very fancy, unique and durable. The packaging is adorable. I love the pink and gold accents and colors. There is a generous amount of product in the tube. I really like that there isn’t any strange tingling feeling or taste on my lips. Usually with a plumping gloss it tingles but this feels just like a moisturizing lip gloss but plumps my lips two sizes bigger. I love carrying this in my purse and showing it off!

"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. 

I sort of like the packaging, it is very... pink. The name doesn't do much either, ""plumpgasm"". Not sure why big brands try to sexualize makeup names. Other than that, upon putting on the gloss, my lips feel chilled, and then after a few minutes, they have a slight burning sensation like how plump glosses usual make my lips feel. The shade I received is already similar to the color of my lips, so it's very subtle other than the glossy appearance. It did plump my lips a little. All in all, I would say I recommend it if you want a more subtle feeling of the burning sensation plump
glosses give you.",4 Apr 2024,Pretty okay,Saning,Tilbury,Lip,No

"4/5 I received the Charlotte Tilbury, big lip, plump gem pillow talk in the shade, deep medium.  My first thoughts are that I like the color on my skin tone which is fair and I also like that the lip gloss is not sticky at all. I did feel a cooling sensation within about 20 seconds after application and I did have a little bit of irritation on areas of my lips which were more dry.  I did see a little bit of plumping action, but mostly it was hydrating my lips and making them a little bit more even toned.  The cooling sensation did not seem to go away, even after an hour after.  I like the packaging but I personally like to see how much product is left and the view is minimal.  The doe foot shaped applicator brush is a bit large and very flexible which made application a little bit harder for me but did not leave staining behind if outside of lip line.  I do find this product less aggressive than the others that I have had.  I would recommend this to anybody that is looking for a plumping lip gloss and a natural shaded lip.  If you’re sensitive to plumper, this still may cause some irritation. @CHARLOTTETILBURY #CTPlumpgasmxInfluenster #CharlotteTilbury @influenster #complimentary",4 Apr 2024,"Great color, doesn’t really plump",provokechaos,Tilbury,Lip,No
Love the packaging very girly it has a great scent the texture is very smooth the lip gloss glides on very smooth it is not sticky which is really great I’m really loving this gloss and I love that it is very pigmented,4 Apr 2024,Love,tenice2002,Tilbury,Lip,No
I’m in love of this shade!! It fits very well with my skin tone which is cold. It feels soft and very easy to apply! Size is great and love the pink packaging,4 Apr 2024,My favorite lip gloss!,mellgp,Tilbury,Lip,No

"The packaging is so nice - you can tell it’s a quality product. I’m sensitive to plumpers so it hurt my lips some but not as much as others. The color is really nice, the scent is mild but good and it goes on really smoothly. I would recommend this product even though I’m sensitive to it.",4 Apr 2024,Great Plumper!,Alider272,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This lipgloss is just ok. The packaging is kind of absurdly large and tacky. Definitely not a lipgloss you can stick in your pocket and go. The color applies extremely sheer so there ain’t much color payoff, and the formula is a bit thinner than I expected. While it does tingle and sting a bit, there aren’t any plumping effects. It has a vanilla mint scent that is fine. If you just need a gloss to apply over your lipliner, this would be fine.",4 Apr 2024,,Therakel,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Was so excited to try the Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Big Lip Plump Gasm the packaging is so stunning & comes with alot of lip product and doesn't take much! Looks like a deep brown but goes on more like a Gloss with a little tint. Gives your lips this cool with little tingling sensation, could tell little difference in my lips being more plumper!! Definitely get your money's worth of product overall very happy!!",4 Apr 2024,Best Lip Plump!!,AnitaC85,Tilbury,Lip,No
I love this gloss. The ‘medium-deep’ is a perfect neutral color for me. I feel like it stays on for a long time and it has that tingly feeling that all plumping glosses have.,4 Apr 2024,Love this!,LucieBmomma,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I really love this lip plumper! It gives my lips some dimension that I wouldn’t have without it. The color is beautiful. It tingles a little bit but it’s not too drastic. It starts to tingle after the first 5 minutes and lasts for about 10-15 minutes. The color does run a lot if you over apply - a little amount goes a long way! You will need to reapply it probably every half hour or so. I use this product daily though, I love it so much more than a normal gloss. I feel like it really helps to moisturize my lips too.",4 Apr 2024,Love this limp plumper!,MaeHova,Tilbury,Lip,No
"Influenster sent me the Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm product complimentary by @CharlotteTilbury. I was excited to try it out because I had heard many good things about it. Upon first application, I noticed that the product gave my lips a beautiful glossy look with a slight purple tint. The color added extra interest to my lips without being too over-the-top.

After a few seconds, I felt a slight warmth and tingle in my lips. I'm guessing that this is the gloss's components working their magic to plump up my lips. The sensation was not uncomfortable and only lasted for a short while.

I appreciate the Lipgasm product because it plumps and enhances lip volume for a fuller look. The plumping effect is not too dramatic, but it is noticeable. And, unlike other lip-plumping products, it doesn't leave my lips dry or chapped.",4 Apr 2024,You must try it.,dreadyJ,Tilbury,Lip,No

"I'm a big fan of the Charlotte Tilbury brand, and again a product from this brand becomes one of my favorites. This time I had the pleasure of trying “Pillow talk big lips plumpgasm” And I'm in love! This lip gloss looks like a balm because it is so moisturizing, it glides on the lips easily and offers incredible comfort on the lips. It has a technology that provides burn-free, sting-free, making the lips look bigger but without suffering. It consists of ingredients that lips love, mainly hyaluronic acid which provides softness, hydration and juicy, attractive lips. I had a wonderful experience! I noticed that my lips really got bigger, and I can say that this lip gloss delivers what it promises, and best of all, it delivers a great result, but without the discomfort of burning lips. I couldn't help but mention the color, which is also beautiful! I loved this product as a whole, this brand has never disappointed me when it comes to quality and great performance. I definitely recommend it..",4 Apr 2024,Wowwww,lov3starr,Tilbury,Lip,No

"This lip gloss is absolutely gorgeous on any skin tone. I'm fair and this gloss brings out a rich color, without making it look like I have a ton of lippy on.

"I’ve been mixed on CT products - some are fantastic and some have been below average. This product is an example of CT at its best. Putting aside that the packaging feels like a lesser version of Pat Mcgrath’s lip items (no stars deducted) this lip gloss plumper doesn’t have the burn I would feel from other brands. I wasn’t sure which color option to get so I got the darker one. It looks natural / nude on the lips. Overall, a great product!",4 Apr 2024,Glossy Pout Action,epopo,Tilbury,Lip,No

"OMG, this plumper is the BOMB. The tingle is real because the plumping is in full effect when you apply this generously smooth formula to your lippies. Pillow Talk killed this formula when they added the most stunning tint to this gloss. I literally don’t go anywhere without it. This is juicy lips in a bottle. All you need is a nude lip liner and you’ll have the most sensational lips. BUY IT NOW.",4 Apr 2024,A MUST HAVE,MrsPahle,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I love the tingle and color of this new gloss! The texture is great, not very sticky but just enough to be long wearing. I’d i’m being picky, the packaging is very kitschy, and looks a little outdated to me. it’s also really bulky. Reminds me of P.Louise packaging. Aside from the weird choice in packaging, I absolutely love love LOVE it! I’ll definitely repurchase.",4 Apr 2024,A big WIN,KaterrrrrrTOTSS,Tilbury,Lip,No

"Red top(don’t mind my hair) is me on any old day with liner & regular gloss. Cream top is after I tried this lip plumper! I’m honestly not sure if I see a huge difference, and I’ve tried a bunch of different lip plumpers. I’m not sure if it’s my insane tolerance for spicy things or what, but aside from a light tingle I never really notice a plumping effect. I will say that my lips feel softer and the lines are less noticeable on my lips which I do love a lot. This plumper is minty as opposed to the spicy peppery-cinnamon taste in other brands. Also, the applicator is thick and soft so it honestly feels like a gentle kiss when applying. Super cute! You also don’t have to pump an insane amount of times because there’s a lot of product on the applicator. Overall, it’s a really good gloss, so I just give it a 4 because I was still hoping for that plumper look which it didn’t have. Oh, and the bottle itself is BEAUTIFUL!",4 Apr 2024,,IzezNoire,Tilbury,Lip,No
"This is the most bougie lip plumper gloss that I have used. Not only the packaging is so elegant and sexy, but the scent, texture, and end result is so luxurious.

"Beautiful, luxury packaging.  Charlotte Tilbury keep their game up with presentation every single time and the formula of this plumping lip gloss is the best one I've ever tried so far.

"Absolutely love this plumping lip gloss. I don’t have anything like it in my collection so I was super excited to try it. The pumping sensation feels a little “weird” at first if you aren’t use to it,but after it just feels like tickles in your lips ( in a good way). I love the shade and how it looks darker  in the wand, but not on my lips. In fact it is very subtle. There is a bit of scent to it, but not overpowering at all. My lips look amazing after applying it and for some reason it gave me a sense of confident, like I feel really good and put together now. In love 100% recommend it.",4 Apr 2024,Best plumping lip gloss..,KarolinaB,Tilbury,Lip,No
I thought the lipgloss tube itself looked cheap with the big lips with a lipstick tube coming from them. The applicator was very nice as well as how well the lipgloss applied. The color is nice too. A lot of tingling and coolness feeling that did not seem to go away for quite a while. The lipgloss remained for about two hours. But there was no plumping. Without the plumping aspect I can’t imagine reapplying every few hours would be worth all the constant tingling you would have to deal with for no reason. Overall would not purchase again and would just purchase a nice lipgloss without plumping from this brand.,4 Apr 2024,No plumping just burning,kmevers1515,Tilbury,Lip,No
I love how it glides on smoothly. It’s not tacky at all. Right away you can feel a cooling on your lips like peppermint. It doesn’t taste or smell like anything. The shine is so great that it looks like your lips are wet. I love it!,4 Apr 2024,Super shiny!,kcfrombk,Tilbury,Lip,No
Love it! This product has the perfect color to it and it looks amazing on my lips! This product stays on your lips forever and the plumping sensation is one that I can tolerate! It has more of a cooling effect than a burning one. If you love pillowtalk you will love this gloss!,4 Apr 2024,Perfect color and shine,Hannahrine13,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I’m always hesitant when a lip product promises to plump because I’ve tried so many that haven’t lived up to the hype. From the ADORABLE packaging / branding to the actual functionality and color, this stuff is a huge WINNER. I’m 43 and my lips are essentially deflated balloons are this point. I was shocked to see it works so well. The color is pretty, it’s long wearing, and of course, as with any plumbing product, you get that strong tingle. Will definitely be buying more in the future.",4 Apr 2024,Will definitely buy more,deena4236,Tilbury,Lip,No
"I recently tried the Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Big Lip Plumpgasm Plumping Lip Gloss in the shade fair-medium, and I am absolutely in love!

"Fair to medium plumpgasm by Charlotte Tilbury is a gorgeous nude pink color. The bottle is so cute and I love that the applicator has a diamond tip for easy application.

This lip plumper is stunning! From the packaging down to the physical looks of this product and the product on me! I am obssesed! Pillow talk in fair medium is the color I got and it’s pure perfection on my fair skin tone. I have thin very thin boring lips and this gave them some body and actually made me feel like I have lips!

This is definitely worth the price and I recommend it!,4 Apr 2024,So stunning on me,Chasipooh,Tilbury,Lip,No
"First things first, the packaging is GORGEOUS!!!! Top tier. It’s my first from the brand , and I’m impressed. As far as the plumper the sensation builds and doesn’t happen immediately, but working a good 5 minutes of application my lips were full on tingly.

This product is amazing!! The packaging is so feminine. The gloss itself smells sweet and chocolatey…it’s easy to apply and feels both cooling and slightly tingly at the same time. It does not “burn” at all…I have naturally full lips but I was able to see a difference. The excess gloss didn’t build up in the corners of my mouth so I was very pleased with that. The color is beautiful and gives a flattering warm berry tint to the lips. This is my new favorite everyday gloss!,4 Apr 2024,This plumper lip gloss knocked my socks off!,chefchanning,Tilbury,Lip,No
Love this gloss! I was able to claim the medium deep shade and it sheers out a bit when you put it on your lips so it isn’t too dark for me! The packaging is super luxe and I like the applicator a lot. The gloss smells like vanilla and peppermint. This DOES make your lips tingle so stay away if you do not like plumping.

"I’m so glad I opted for Pillow Talk (Fair-Med), it is the perfect color for me! This lip gloss is a soft dusty pink infused with heat and ice technology plus Hyaluronic acid and Collageneer for plumping. There’s also a 3-D gloss effect giving the illusion of plumper lips. I’ve used it over everything from dusty mauve lipstick to a peachy nude matte lip stain to maximize the color. Upon application, your lips warm and tingle.
