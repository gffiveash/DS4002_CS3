"I thought this orange shade would be a great alternative to something more traditional, but this one has no pigment. And the more you try to build it up, the more glitter ends up on your face. So if you get it to a shade that you like, you also wind up with to big patches of what looks like craft glitter from Michael's on your face. One of the ingredients further down on the list is also talc. So don't think you're getting away from talc just because it's a cream formula.",No pigment.

My friend was sure it wouldn’t show up because it was too close to her natural coloring (it showed up). I was convinced it would look clownish on me (it did not).

"It's a good blush, but I found it a bit hard to apply, though that's probably just a me issue as this is my first cream blush but even after warming it with my fingers and on the back of my hand I found it very thick and hard to disperse on my cheeks. That being said, it still felt super lightweight in wearing it and looked great. Love the colour as well. 
It's just a very small amount for the price, even for Fenty standards. 
I can see why people love it, but it's just not for me and I probably wouldn't repurchase.","Great colour, but not the blush for me",10 Feb 2023,BernR,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"Beautiful colour, and currently obsessed with the Fenty Beauty cream blushes. It blends out really well over foundation and I love the pigment. I will definitely be purchasing again once I run out. I have oily skin and this blush has good staying power on my skin. Please note: most blushes tend to fade as the day wears on because blush is usually the first thing to go. If you want stronger & longer lasting colour, layer with a powder blush over.",,2 Feb 2023,KandyCee,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I wear Fenty 445 and 21 in Eaze drop for reference.
I must be too dark for this shade. It’s a pretty color, but I had to dab way too many times to get it to even show up a little on my skin. Makes me sad because I really like the color but it’s too much effort than I’m used to for such a pricey product.",I had to give up on this,28 Jan 2023,JNayD,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I really think I’ll never use anything besides a cream for blush every again! So easy to blend. Very buildable. Petal poppin and Strawberry daiquiri are the two I have and they look quite similar on the face. Petal poppin is more true pink.

"i have this in bikini martini and its my favourite blush ever, im a medium skin tone but it still gives a good pay off despite its light shade. it reminds me of that viral dior blush in cream form. my only complaint is how tiny the product is, especially for the price.",tiny packaging beautiful product,23 Jan 2023,Minaa000,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"After doing a little more research on the color wheel, under tones, and over tones, trust me when I say this product is PHENOMENAL! I love the experience of the product of dipping my finger tips into it and then applying it to my face. I also love how smooth and bendable the formula is against any any foundation. If you have a more olive tone skin, the hint of purple in this shade balances out the cool/neutral undertone giving you a very natural, long lasting finish.",Brown Girl Friendly,17 Jan 2023,MissDianna1,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I really like this blush. the pink is very bright so it’s a bit less natural but that’s ok. i love to use this and i love the consistency. my one problem is that it’s a bit hard to blend and can show up a bit patchy but you just have to blend a lot.,really pretty,16 Jan 2023,Ir10,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I can never get this to apply evenly without being patchy. I've tried this on top of several different base products, but it's patchy no matter what else I use and whether I use a little product or a lot. It feels rather dry so it's hard to spread, which is probably why. I've had more success with Milani and Canmake cream blushes.","Patchy, hard to spread",15 Dec 2022,helegg,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Love the product itself. I have the petal poppin shade and wanted a cooler pink to wear in the winter so I ordered the cool berry shade. It is NOT like the color pictured. This blush is basically purple. Very disappointed.,Not the same color in the picture online,6 Dec 2022,KatherineWW,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Really enjoy this product but it is def not in my holy grail category. I have it In Summertime and Cool Berry. Both lovely colors and very similar so you only need one. It applies smoothly and is easy to blend. Drys down to a natural matte. Only gripe is that it doesn’t last a full day.,Beautiful,17 Nov 2022,BABS,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I bought this because the Strawberry Drip shade is kind of unique for a blush, and I can't seem to find something this vibrant in other brands, but this is so disappointing. It isn't blendable, it needs to be slightly creamier! It's a little too dry in the pan. It also has zero staying power.",Don't bother.,7 Nov 2022,rachaelsc,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I've been into cream blushes recently and I had been looking for a redish-orangy everyday blush. I decided to purchase this blush in store and I do not regret it.
It's so easy to blend and I love that the color is not really pigmented to make it look too harsh on my skin tone (I'm light-medium brown).
Just perfect for everyday or sometimes I just put some concealer and this blush on and it looks so clean and natural.
I do not like that because of the formula, it gets messy very quickly though.",Perfect for everyday summer-fall,10 Oct 2022,AleCorGri,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I have Bikini Martini & Crush on Cupid. They are more on the matte side, but not fully matte. Topping them with a powder blush, translucent setting powder or mattifying setting spray can easily yield true matte results. As I have mature skin, I err on the side of dewy/luminous. I’ve found the best application for me is to use a brush, spray it with a setting spray (I use What it Dew) and apply in a stippling motion; any brush works.  I usually use a flat foundation brush by Anastasia or one of these by Morphe; M6, M449, R46, or M500. 

It lasts as long as I need it to, I’ve never had to reapply. They are very buildable! I have fair skin and have friends of different ethnicities, I’d definitely consider this cream blush line to be fully inclusive. 

Learning curve for those new to cream blush is very small with this brand. I’ve been using cream blush since Laura Mercier dropped hers. 

This blush sits nicely in the pan and is relatively firm. This is nice and gives you more control for building versus something creamier may be more difficult to control application. 

I’ll definitely be working on getting the entire collection. I love the brand although as with all brands, Fenty has its fair share of hits and misses. These are a hit and make a great addition to anyones collection. 

Colors are pretty much spot on compared to the online pictures, too.",An Absolute Must-Have For Blush Lovers!,5 Jul 2022,LoriCrosby,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I have seen a lot of reviews of this item being expensive for what you get. I will say I thought that at first also. But I got Petal Poppin (my first one) about a year ago and wear it a few times a week and still have a good amount of product to go and I do use a good amount I just started to really hit pan on it. I find using a damp sponge works great with blending it out nicely and quick I have really dry skin and find that trying to use my finger just doesn't work or look as nice as a damp sponge.,Worth the price,10 Jun 2022,TiaMJ,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I absolutely adore this blush! I find that I really enjoy being able to use a cream blush as it is easier to work with and build to the desired effect. It's also very easy to blend out if you overapply in any one area. I have fair skin and this gives me a nice natural look. I find it works best using my fingers rather than a brush or sponge.

"Love Fenty's cream blush formula. This is my third blush from the brand. ""Crush on Cupid"" is truly such a stunning colour. You can really sheer it out or pack on the pigment. I have very light skin, so I was worried this colour would be too vibrant, but it's actually beautiful and can be sheered out very easily. Overall this formula is so easy to work with. It looks good applied over powder, it applies well over my sunscreen and doesn't cause pilling. I find it to be great. The only con and the reason I'm removing 1 star is because the lasting power isn't there. The colour will visibly fade after about 3 hours. Fortunately it's easy to reapply over other makeup, but this isn't a long lasting formula.",,22 Apr 2022,georgiaapeaach,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I'm a liquid blush convert and I'm never going back. Cream blush is queen! This glides on so smoothly and I find that it even works well with my cheap elf brushes, which is a plus.

Once blended into the skin it creates a beautiful pink pale lavender colour that will look flattering on ALL skin tones. The formula is nice and creamy, very blendable  and easy to work with.

I find that this blush is one of the most easy to blend cream blushes ever. I prefer finger application and blending with this one to minimize lifting any product but sponge is great if you’re looking for a more natural look. It starts out sheer and a little oily  and dries down after a bit into a matte finish. I find it has great lasting power and i can usually extend the lasting power by setting it with a powder blush. Overall great cream blush + the size is going to last you forever.,Perfect balance between a pigmented + sheer!,16 Feb 2022,meganleungx,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I'm almost 50.  I have skin texture and large pours.  Up until a couple years ago, I used powder blush which settled in my pores and showed texture.  So, I stopped using it and went to the bronzed look.  Well, I missed color in my make up.  I started with lip color (my obsession) and then thought, ""Let's try blush again.""  I tried some of the top rated, powder and liquid.  The powders showed my texture and wore off quickly, while the liquid was way too pigmented and didn't blend.  I got a sample of this in some kit from Sephora and thought I'd try it.  It was amazing.  Buildable color, easy blending, no texture and just the right amount of pigmentation make this a winner.  And yes, I am now a blush person.",I think I'm a blush person!,20 Jan 2022,GigiCrawford,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

It went on beautifully and the COLOR! Oh my god I just love it. I went one layer at a time because I knew I could keep building the color up but of course it’s harder to take it away.  Then I actually used my foundation brush which still had a little on it to touch up the application. I wear makeup for only a short time but after four hours it held up well! I’m putting the cream bronzer and the brush in my cart right now.,Easy application and wears beautifully…,15 Oct 2021,KayPaige94,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I really REALLY wanted to love this product. However, upon receiving it in the mail I was very disappointed with the size! It's so small! which makes it messy because of the brushes. I feel this should be a travel size instead of full size. Because that's what it is. A mini travel size. Then after trying the color...it just wasn't for me. It shows up as a very bright pink. So unfortunately I will be exchanging this and picking up Rare Beauty blush instead.",,12 Oct 2021,amwells,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"This blush was absolutely beautiful, it was the perfect flush of color for my cheeks. We all know nothing says “put together” more than a blush with matching lids and lips, so I found you can safely use this on your lips and lids. I use my fingers to swipe this on the apples of my cheeks and blend outwards. I also place this all over my lid, and use a lip brush to line or fill in my lips. 

The texture is a little different than other creame blushes I have tried. The formula is a solid, until you swirl your finger into it, and it becomes a lotion-y texture. Once applied, it dries like a powder, but isn’t matte. It is not dry, which I love. A problem I have with some blushes is them being too dry, but this one is not.

However, it is very small for the price. .10 oz. I paid just $16 for a .10 oz Kaja blush AND a highlighter.

I also have to use a lot to get the payoff I want, so I have a feeling it won’t last long. Over all, great but small.","Great, but small",18 Sep 2021,Stormyloves,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I avoided this blush for so long because everyone was obsessing over it. I recognize that is a ridiculous reason to not try something - but it feels like people overhype everything these days. I finally tried it after numerous brands at Sephora were not hitting the mark. 
So, yes, this blush is AMAZING and worth the praise. Here's why: the color range is unmatched, the application is foolproof and doesn't require a brush (great for traveling light), the price is reasonable, and the formula is incredible. It is flattering on dry and/or aging skin and allows for a natural flush, or you can build up for a bolder look. You don't need much, so I anticipate it lasting for quite some time. It also wears nicely throughout the day. 
I purchased Strawberry Drip for my natural skin tone (light with neutral undertones), and the Summertime Wine for my spray tan skin tone. I think the colors are so versatile and flattering that it is hard to go wrong. And at this price point, you can buy multiple for the price of one blush of another brand (this an affordable price when considering that you are buying cosmetics at Sephora).",Fiiiine....it really is AMAZING,21 Aug 2021,cmccoy,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

i have heard about the fenty cream blush so many times so i decided to give it a try. i got the shade petal poppin and it’s a super cute pink for spring and summer. i have light skin and i feel like it’s not too bright on me. i love the shade range. the only negative thing i would have to say is the price bc you can get the elf cream blush that works similarly for cheaper. the elf one does have less shades tho and fenty has nice packaging with a mirror so it seems to even out. the elf one is a really great affordable option for those on a budget who don’t mind cheaper packaging!,great cream blush,10 Aug 2021,sydneyann22,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

This is the perfect texture and pigmentation to just tap on with my finger and it blends out seamlessly! Rose Latte is the shade I’ve been looking for my entire life. I’ve always had issues with blushes looking too red or too pink on my skin. This is a nice warm brown shade and does not pull pinky at all like the arm swatch photo. It looks like a natural flush.

"A great formula! Very blend-able and pigmented enough to where you only need a dab or two, but I’ve never had an issue with blending out if over-applied. I have multiple shades and although it has shimmer, Fuego Flush is my favorite. My problem with this blush is the size of the pan. It is so small (perfect for travel!) that basically every brush/sponge makes the packaging a mess.

Fuego flush is the perfect summer glow shade! I’ve never tried an orange blush before but was drawn to this shade above all others and I’m so glad I got it. It’s sheer but buildable and applies like a dream. Looks good on bare skin or foundation and it even holds up without primer/setting powder. Definitely sweat resistant like it claims too.

"I'm new to cream blush. I am a WOC (think Fenty 420-445 range, neutral golden undertone. I do not have a shade match in Fenty foundations) and I enjoy sheer, shimmer-free blushes in the coral family. I drape my blush and usually apply it high on my cheekbones, temples, and brow bones/forehead. I don't like this product for me. The color is stunning, but a bit too harsh of a red on me- it makes me look sunburnt or like I'm having an allergic reaction to something. I also find that the color is very flat on me. There is no shimmer, which I love, but the formula is dry enough that it offers very little dimension/glow on my cheeks no matter what I prep my skin with. The blush is difficult to blend with my fingers, difficult to control with a brush, and I don't like applying creams with sponges so I can't speak on that. It does, however, look really good on my lips under a gloss. It has fantastic longevity but is difficult to remove without an oil cleanser (I don't use makeup wipes) and actually stained the skin of my friend with a drastically lighter complexion than mine. I haven't used foundation in a long time, but I feel that this would work best built up and layered under foundation as opposed to placed on top because of how dry it is. I should also mention that the mirror is great despite how tiny it is and that this product is super expensive considering its size ($200/oz). I definitely see the appeal of this blush, but it just isn't what I'm going for, and that's ok! I'm going to return it and move on. I've found that I prefer the formulation and finish Patrick Ta's blush duos (and surprisingly his coral shade isn't ashy?), so consider that one if you have similar preferences!",Not For Me,20 Jun 2021,JJRO20,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

It’s definitely more of a buildable color so you won’t end up looking clowny which is awesome with the brighter colors. Feels soft and light on skin, not greasy like some cream blushes.

I got bikini martini which is a beautiful Barbie pink. Not overly pigmented and it is hydrating. I like the color a lot. It’s hard to use over foundation (I use liquid & powder). I feel it budges my makeup so I will try to find way to use it. What I hate is that it doesn’t last even though it’s a cream product. I don’t want to have to reapply a cream blush over makeup I already set. I recommend this product but it’s not the best out there.,,12 Jun 2021,Katk3,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"Although a nice color that worked well for me, I didn't find it to be all that creamy and easy to apply.

I used to use Becca's cream blush.",Did not work for me.,27 May 2021,spudsy2,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"It doesn't blend out evenly no matter what method I try.  The color also pulls warmer than you'd expect.  I end up topping it off with a powder blush just to get it to look even.  It does have a decent staying power after that but on its own it fades quickly. 

I don't mind that it's so small but the rounded edges make it really hard to hold while you open an already awkward clasp.",A bit patchy,26 May 2021,kittleherder,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"First impressions: when I opened this, it was sweating and had an oily film covering the top of the product. I had to wipe it off, and the droplets were pure oil. I didn't love that. However, once I wiped off the oil and the first coat of product, I really liked the product. I find it swatches with a lot of purple and blue undertones, but when applied and blended out it's true to the shade as pictured. I tend to have issues with red pigments and it breaks me out- but so far this blush hasn't caused any skin issues which is a big win for me. Additionally, I was afraid it would stay oily on the skin, but it actually dries down pretty nicely and feels weightless on the skin. The shimmer is extremely minimal! I was expecting more shimmer, but when applied to the cheek it's more of a nice sheen than a true shimmer. Overall this blush is nice. It has decent lasting power, and it feels nice on the skin. I wouldn't consider this formula a game changer or a holy grail product, but I enjoy it and will likely use it up.","Decent lasting power, nice sheen finish",26 May 2021,georgiaapeaach,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"Really nice (very sheer) cool pink shade, looks nice with violet/plum lip tints :3 a lot of people are complaining about the pan size, but I have one (fuego flush) from the day it came out and there’s still product in it. I have pretty light skin though, maybe you have dark skin or like blush to show up a lot then you’ll run through it quicker.",Super cute,18 May 2021,Ang3lie,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Here are two picture where I used it with and without makeup on (nada). I have to say I am so happy with it! I understand that people may be deceived by the size of the product, but I like the concept behind it where you can buy multiple colours and choose which vibe you want. Also, if it is smaller, it means that you can finish the product before it expires! Everyone has different preferences though, but personally I enjoy it. I already had the shade Daiquiri Dip, but when I used it on my bare face, it emphasized my red spot on my cheeks a lot. I was so impressed when I put this on my bare cheeks. 

Petal Poppin is really a flattering shade on your go to for your no makeup days and I’m living for it. I use a dense brush to pick up the product and dab it on. Do no swipe if you are wearing foundation, it will disturb your base. 

Like I said in my other review, I have combo skin and really dry skin on my cheeks. When I used fenty’s blushes, it does not leave any dry spot and my face looks pretty dewy.

Overall, I cannot say how much I enjoy this collection so far. I’ve never been too much of a blush girl and only used Rare beauty liquid blush in the shade joy, but now I am so in love with these cream blushes.",LOVE IT ON BARE SKIN,17 May 2021,Fabakari,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I’ve just been getting into cream blushes and bronzers. I have a couple of milk stick blushes and decided to purchase this one during the sale. 

As previous reviews mentioned, it is pretty pigmented, a little goes a long way. I’m used to milk blushes where they are not that pigmented. However I do enjoy this more pigmented cream blend for more make up days and use the milk blushes for my no make up make up days. 

So many reviews complained about the blush being small...It is...but it’s blush, you’re never going to hit pan on a bigger blush. I tend to follow expiration dates on my make up so I actually purchased this because it’s small and likely will use it within the year. I find the price was actually pretty good, especially with the sale considering. 

I realized I often don’t hit pan on anything other than bronzer so I prefer to buy small or travel size versions of blush and highlighter.",Love!,20 Apr 2021,AryaRose,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I have very fair, neutral-toned skin and this purple blush actually works so well. It’s such a unique blush color that would be good for literally any skin tone. It’s super buildable, and with a light hand and a brush it’s kind of a berry-tone, similar to Glossier’s Jam lipstick. For a potentially deep toned blush, it actually comes off as springy. For lighter skin tones, it’s definitely a noticeable but very in line with blush trends.",Drama Cla$$ on lighter skin,18 Apr 2021,lburda,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This product looks beautiful, this works as a blush and bronzer both. It looks very nice and slightly dewy. But it is super hard to blend with makeup sponge or brush or fingers.

"So I love a good orange toned blush, I feel like it brings so much warmth and glow to the face. So of course I needed to try the shade Fuego Flush. I am pretty disappointed by this shade I have to say, my skin tone is light with olive undertones and this blush barley showed up on my skin tone. It added the smallest amount of flush to my cheeks and me being so light in skintone makes me sad that this won't work on medium and deep skin tones.

"I may be pale for this colour, but I was getting tired of the pink/coral blush so I gave it a try. I dipped a dense brush slightly in the product and it was more than enough. I was so impressed with this blush. I think this blush is one of the most pigmented from this collection and this is why it did not fade like the others state. Also, with this bright red, it is very easy to have a clown vibe if you are not careful. I have combination skin and my cheeks are really dry and after applying, it did not leave any dry patches on my cheeks and it leaves a pretty dewy finish.

"First off, the packaging really is so tinyyy! It's not what I was expecting. You really don't get much product for the price, but honestly I've had this blush for many months and I still have a ton of product left. You really don't need much for a lot of color payoff. The shade I own is Petal Poppin', a true baby pink. I've found that with this blush it applies better with a brush or a sponge than with my finger. The staying power is amazing for a cream blush.

"Really beautiful cream blushes. Fuego Flush is stunning on olive/ tan skin--I would not say orange at all, but a gorgeous peachy, tawny, golden glow that's the perfect look for summer. For this effect, it has to be built up with several applications. After the beating my skin took from prolonged exposure to indoor heat during Covid #stayhome, it's just what it needs to look dewy and hydrated. So many blushes just look pink or red--thanks Rihanna for a truly sun-kissed look! Daiquiri Dip is also a vibrant, warm color, but a more conventional red, and more pigmented. Both are fabulous and I'll be getting more shades.

"SO, FIRST OFF I LOOOOVE FENTY BEAUTY, like die for it. HOWEVER, I actually ended up returning this blush because PERSONALLY I was looking for a more pigmented cream blush (spoiler, Im writing my next review on the Tower 28 Cream Blush in Golden Hour because that's now my everyday blush, go look for my Sephora review on that product next!!). 

THE DETAILS: This is a creamy blush with a slightly dewy finish, nothing CRAZY, but def along the lines of a more hydrating product as most cream products I see, are. It has very small (not super noticeable at all) shiny particles in it for reflecting light, which is pretty. The texture and consistency is creamy and glides on skin well when applied with fingers, a little tough to apply with a brush. The packaging is also a little tough to open especially with makeup product on your hands. DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE COLORS, they sheer out sooo much I mean you can blend it so much to the point that it disappears into skin, which is the main negative for me. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: I prefer a more pigmented blush, therefore I would NOT buy again. BUT it is an AMAZING PRODUCT if you like a sheer, dewy finish for a natural blush look, this is for you! I did enjoy the blush though, if I ever decide NOT to be a blush junkie then, I would re-purchase this blush for that natural look. (SEE ATTACHED PHOTO to see how SHEER this blush is, I am wearing it in the photo. There is a slight wash of cold, but giiiirl I like my blush to POP Kackie-Fjord style). 

CREDENTIALS (hehe): I have tried Glossier Cloud Paint, Rare Beauty blush, the Nudestix Blush, the Illia cream Blush stick, the Merit Blush stick, The Creme Shop cushion blush, Honest Beauty cream Blush, Kjer Weiss, Charlotte Tilbury, and Kaja and none of them compare to the one I use now-- which is not the Fenty :(","If you want A VERY SHEER AND DEWY blush, if not...",1 Mar 2021,badgalmomo,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I own a few different colours of this blush so my rating is a reflection of the blush as a whole. I own 4 colours and find that they all perform very differently. 2 are lighter on the spectrum and blend poorly. They are too sheer, don't build up well and are honestly too expensive for what they are (the average blush has about 2 oz of product, these have 1 so are  are comparable to higher end blushes). The other 2 are more unique colours (strawberry and fuego) but appear to have more of a sheen to them and can highlight texture. As they are so expensive when you consider price per ounce, I would only recommend these if you are looking for a fun colour that can't be found elsewhere, they really are nothing special formula wise.",Poor formula but cost $$$,9 Feb 2021,ItsAMeBrittney,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I’m a light skin blonde but Cool Berry caught my eye in the store, especially as there are little flecks of shimmer in there (which I usually don’t like in my blush but this is pretty).

I’m around an NC15/16 in MAC. I picked this up just wanting to give it a try. It’s a pretty color if you’re looking for that flushed look. You don’t need a lot so even tho it’s small it’ll last a decent amount of time,,4 Feb 2021,IamJennC,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

This blush is everything!  It blends smoothly and effortlessly with my fingers. Didn’t mess with my cc cream. Gave me a beautiful glow!  Not oily. It’s that glow you get like on vacay. It also stayed put all day!  Usually I have trouble with powder blushes disappearing by the end of the day or making my complexion look flat. This is beautiful. It only takes a small amount too.

This product is definitely more in-line with subtle/natural makeup (think K-beauty) but you can still build it up, with some effort, for bolder color. I'm definitely buying more shades.

This is a nice creamy blush but the color is a little dark for my fair skin.  I’m hoping that I can use it in summer when I have a little more color to my skin.

"I have to layer this product on to have a noticeable amount of orange, but that isn't a huge deal breaker for me, it's just not as bright orange as I thought it would be. I didn't realize there was shimmer in the blush, I think that's great during the summer time / if you want a glowy look. Unfortunately not what I'm into. That's just personal preference. That being said, the consistency is great, it lasts all day, I can wear it with or without foundation and it doesn't make me look greasy.

"After checking out reviews after reviews, I zoned in on fuego. I'm into orange look lately and wanted badly to have an orange blush (not reddish orange but true orange). This looked like it could be it. On application, it looks dewy orange on my skin which I looovvve. However, after half an hour when the product had melted/blended on my skin, I'm left with no orange glow but just gold sparkles all over my face. Definitely not the look I was going for.  Now..onto to the next find. In the meantime, I managed to make this work by using it as a base to my Clinique and Burts Bees blushes.",Better as a base,28 Dec 2020,tiness,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

Great buy.",Love this!,21 Dec 2020,makeupgt5,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Love this cheeky blush!  The colour looks matte and very strong in the compact, but if you apply it with a light sweep of your fingers and blend it gives such a lovely natural flush. I work the colour in - two dabs per cheek gives me the best colour payoff. Just make sure you blend well with your fingertips!  The compact is small but elegant. Way to go Rihanna!",Fenty does it again!,21 Dec 2020,hamiltonnance,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
These are sooooo worth it! Yes they are tiny but I have barely made a dent in mine that I got this summer. I am very fair in the winter months but with a light hand this gives me the most beautiful flush of color. I have this in two colors: petal poppin and strawberry drip. Strawberry drip is the perfect color for the summer months on tanned skin. Petal poppin is the softest baby pink that gives you that just stepped in from the cold look. I love these. Get them!,worth your money,19 Dec 2020,kimmywoowoo,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I have normal skin but this blush was way too dry for me and hard to blend. Staying power is good though but it's so annoying to apply so I never use it, the worst cream blush I've ever tried.",,18 Dec 2020,wimbeldonnn,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Yes I'm fair, yes this shade LOOKS dark, but I swear this will work for you. Let me explain how I make it look like the sweetest, warm flush ever. I apply my normal foundation, concealer and cream contour, and without setting my foundation I'll tap into the product with my middle finger and start alternating between using my finger to apply lightly and my brush to soften and blend it out. I use a tapered ""contour"" brush to stipple it out and blend it into my skin. It's not dark or opaque, it's just a sheer wash of beautiful color and it works so well for me! I love a bronzy blush, I've always hated pink or red toned blushes, it makes me look like Snow White. But this brings a light, warm flush that I just can't get enough of. Don't be afraid of this shade if you're fair, trust me when I say you'll love it!","Ok, here me out!!!",17 Dec 2020,LittleMere,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Picked this up yesterday after an SA recommended it. The consistency is nice and easy to blend with your fingers. Tried it on my lips as well - blended very easily.

"Since Kevyn Aucoin’s creamy glow disappeared :( I needed a replacement for the bloodroses plum blush that I grew to love over the years. I’m a medium-tan, olive undertone, mixed-race gal who constantly finds that peaches don’t show up well on my skin and bubblegum pinks make my cheeks look too artificial. I’ve given so many blushes away over the years looking for the right shade for my skin. Purples and plum cream formulas seem to look the most natural on my skin tone. I’ve been using this shade for about a year and will not turn back, with two backups up my arsenal. Nowhere near as purple as it looks, just a gorgeous mauve-berry colour that, on my medium skin tone, actually matches my natural blush and makes me look like I’ve been exercising or.. whatever else causes people to sweat a lot. Either way, this is a one of a kind formula that stays on during the hot summer months and does not fade throughout the day, provided that you powder a little from time to time. A perfect replacement for my old plum blush, and new staple in my kit. Hello Fenty!",Don’t let the violet scare you!,2 Dec 2020,BrokeUniStudent,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

This is a really pretty natural color. It is easy to apply and has great staying power. My only issue with this is that it has some sparkle. I took off a star because I didn't expect that and I don't like sparkles. They are small and blend well with the product though. It's just personal preference and I wish that it was explicitly advertised that it had sparkle in it.

"This blush is just okay; not life changing but also not worth major criticism.  I waited for Fuego Flush to come back in stock and jumped to buy it.  The orange color is so unique and beautiful.  The blush description says ""wash of color and natural-looking"" in the description, so do not expect the pigment of an Hourglass or Tarte blush.  This is not that, but the product description doesn't say it is.  Yes, it's natural and not a strong pigment, but you do see it go on and it would probably be good for no foundation days in the summer.  I'd like to try another color, but my main complaint is that the product is not long lasting throughout the day.  For that reason, I probably won't buy anymore.","Keywords: ""natural-looking""",14 Oct 2020,JLO787,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I tried applying 3 different ways: finger, beauty blender, and brush. It all looked terrible. Before I returned them I tried them again but before I set my foundation. Again I used my fingers, beauty blender, and brush and it just moved my foundation right off my checks. Would not recommend if you’re using this with a full face of makeup.

"This creme blush is a gorgeous shade to give a little color and shape to the face for anyone medium and richer in skin tone. It smooths out beautifully and doesn't seem to have any setting properties so you can take your time blending it out. I'm unsure why people say it is not pigmented, it is rich in color and long lasting on the face.",Gorgeous bronzey warmth!,4 Oct 2020,gatita,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"REALLY like this product! So far I’ve bought it in 2 colors & will probably buy more! It’s super creamy & you can decide how much you want to use to choose your look. A little for a subtle, natural glow, another layer for a more “healthy flush” or more for a dramatic look. It blends beautifully with a beauty blender, brush, or fingers.

"I love the color of this blush. I also enjoy the finish of it. What I don't love as much is how much it takes to build this up. I can't speak to other colors as I've only tried Fuego Flush so far, but I have to build and build and build to get this to show up on my light skin tone. I have found that it works better with a brush. With a sponge, you could sit there trying to build it up forever. Overall its a good formula, I'd be interested to try some other shades and see if they're more pigmented.",,18 Sep 2020,emilywitts96,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I have some thoughts about this product. The first thing I noticed is the product is much tinier than I expected. When I put it on my finger it appears very waxy, but when you put it on the skin it instantly melts into your face. It has a very beautiful flush and wears well throughout the day. However, for the price and how much your getting, it really isn't worth it. I mean, it's a pretty blush, but the pigment and the quality don't match with the price and how much product you get. I unfortunately can't reccomend this to anyone and won't be repurchasing. I will still continue to use It though.",Thoughts......,17 Sep 2020,Sofboi,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"It’s hard to find cream blush. I do not know this line but took a chance due to color selection. I use a foundation brush to apply and this goes on very smooth with excellent blend ability. When cream blush blends that well you expect it to wear off and not go the distance. The first day I tried it I took a nap and it was 100 plus degrees outside. I only have a wall unit for air conditioner. I expected to wake up looking half dead and would need to reapply. When I looked in the mirror my blush was exactly the same! I didn’t need to do anything! I was stunned...

I then purchased three more colors. If you apply too much you can easily blend it out making it pretty much mistake proof. It’s not so thick you can’t add a powder blush as a top off. It has a nice moisturizing feel with a dewy look but not sticky or wet.

I have very fair yellow based (warm) skin tone and I am able to wear Bikini Martini, Crush on Cupid, Strawberry Drip and Summertime Wine. If that helps anyone trying to decide color selection. 

I will look at more from this line as obviously a lot of thought and care went into delivering an exception cream blush.",A Five Star Cream Blush,9 Sep 2020,TheSand,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I’m surprised people are complaining about the size and price of the blushes. The prize and size seem pretty standard to me. I got the fuego flush and drama class colors and the purple is one of my favorite blushes now. I have dark skin and the color looks wonderful on me. The blush starts out subtle but is very buildable and I love the shine of the cream consistency. I don’t wear a highlight with this blush because it’s its own highlight. I’m a big fan of these cream blushes!,Great Colors!,7 Sep 2020,Ahmenat,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I'm a big fan of cream cheek products, and I think I've found a new favorite! The Petal Poppin color is so pretty, and it lasts for at least 6-7 hours in the summer sun.

The compact is pretty tiny, and I wish there was more.",A Beautiful Long-Lasting Blush,7 Sep 2020,mpndr34,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Stunning sheer blush! The color looks way darker in the pan than it is on my skin. It’s the perfect sun kissed nude bronze color. It’s very easy to apply bc the formula isn’t overly pigmented.

"After watching several videos and reading reviews, I decided to give this blush a shot. It was very easy to apply and it was buildable. It didn’t take much product to get the look I wanted. I am very happy with this shade. It looks lovely on my fair/light skin tone. The product is small. However, I have never went through an entire blush so in reality this should be fine for most people. I hope that more shades come out that are more neutral. There aren’t any other shades at the moment that I’m interested in. Overall, this is a very nice blush and I do recommend this shade.",Very nice color and easy application,22 Aug 2020,lynds93,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"Seriously crushing on this blush in Drama Cla$$.  Such a pretty natural glow.  Buildable, smooth texture and easy to blend.  I was so curious about a purple blush and so glad I gave it a go.  The photos got me.  I have an olive skin tone and this shade goes on as a pretty natural looking pink that's a bit on the cooler side without being too pink.  It goes really well with my natural lip color.  Cute flushed look.  One of my faves and I'm a bit of a blush addict.  I love Glossier cloud paint and this gives a similar result but is easier to apply and control. (Side note:  I wear this on moisturized skin so can't speak to how it sits foundation.)

Initially I thought the purple would be crazy looking on my dark brown skin. It’s a sheer pink on me and I love it. I would wear it with everything!

"I was so excited to try this, but it was too light for my skin tone. I’m between medium and medium tan and this is too light for me even after trying to build it up like crazy. I like the formula, but this color barely shows up and I do not like that I can see orange glitter particles on my cheeks. I wasn’t expecting that! I’m happy that the formula blends easily and layers well over powder without disturbing products below. Three stars is mainly for this color being too light and the glitter.

I absolutely love this blush! It's such a beautiful color in the Summertime Wine! For the price point.. It's pricey for $20 and there's many other products like this. For what you get honestly.. It's a tad pricey. The product applies beautifully and blends nicely overall. Does it last on the face? Not really. I can get a good few hours of wear.. But it does dissipate thru the day. It just needs a bit more tweaking. But overall like it and would recommend.,,9 Aug 2020,LunaDeathstryke,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I've been using this cream blush for several months now.  I love the color and the ease of application.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the staying power.  I need to put a powder blush down first, apply the cream blush with my fingers, and then another layer of powder blush.  I don't mind the three step process because it takes seconds of my makeup routine but others may want just a one step.

"I was surprised how tiny this blush was when I received it and I felt initially ripped off, but for the small amount of product I need for each use, and the quality of the product, I do think it's worth the price, even for the sample-sized packaging. I think this product is pretty much fool-proof, since you can build the colour up but it easily blends in to the skin. Petal Poppin is a brighter pink than I expected, but still looks very natural blended in. My only issue with the product is that it doesn't have a very long wear time. For light, summer makeup looks I think this product is perfec.t.",Blends like a dream!,30 Jul 2020,cassluvsmakeup,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I bought this and Petal Poppin, amazing. They blend out amazing with a beauty sponge and leave a very natural flushed look. I have oily skin and I found they wore great and lasted. Perfect for summer when you want a no makeup, makeup look!",The bomb,30 Jul 2020,kelsmd,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! i wear this on the daily before i apply my setting powder and it looks so natural and adds a lot of dimension with just a little tap of color,great for daily use,30 Jul 2020,jessu369,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I love these cream blushes! After a couple of months of using the blush in Petal Poppin, I decided to try a different color. The blush itself is great- long-lasting and it applies beautifully. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that this blush is MUCH darker in person. It's not mauve as advertised, it's actually a dark purple.",Color is different in person,30 Jul 2020,RachelAdele,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
This is a beautiful blush. The formula is very nice and  buidable. I love to pair it with NARS orgasm X for a beautiful corral blush.,,29 Jul 2020,sbjlouky,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I absolutely love this cream blush. First of all, the color is absolutely divine. On my tan skin, it shows up as a healthy, rosy magenta flush. The texture is absolutely brilliant: you can tap it in with your fingers or use a blush brush, and it blends out absolutely seamlessly. Although it is pigmented, it’s also surprisingly blendable, so you can always keep tapping and it’ll settle into your skin for a natural-looking flush. In terms of how it shows up on the skin, it is a ‘glowy matte’. I know that doesn’t make any sense, but that’s exactly what it is. I’ve tried other cream blushes that show up so shiny that they highlight the imperfections on my cheek and make me look sweaty, not glowy. This blush gives a nice natural shine to the cheek and makes your skin look even smoother. It dries down well and doesn’t feel heavy or sticky on the cheek; it’s absolutely light. Easily buildable too, so when I layer on the lighter color “Petal Poppin”, this shade looks brighter, and when I layer on “Rose Latte”, it looks warmer and more romantic. Absolutely wonderful. Although the blush compact itself is quite small, there is no way you will run out of this stuff soon. There is enough product in there to last you a while. I highly recommend!",Lit from Within!,28 Jul 2020,AnjaleeeG,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I think this blush can play on the drama and casual side of makeup. It was a cream, almost gel like texture, and so you can layer it or use it with or without makeup",Definitely Soft Violet,28 Jul 2020,crys0810,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I cannot express how in love with this blush I am. The formula is so amazing, the colour doesn't look too oud or out there, very subtle yet visibly blushing. So beautiful. I love cream products so this girl didn't disappoint. Wish it was bigger but a little goes a long way. Fenty came through with this one.",LOVE,28 Jul 2020,Golisa,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I love this blush. I understand that a lot of people like to do a full coverage glam look all the time but I'm so glad these are as sheer as they are because I prefer a light coverage, no makeup look and this blush is amazing for that while still being very buildable in case you do want more color. this was my first attempt at a cream blush and its so easy to blend with my fingers, doesn't look patchy, and lasts all day. I'm medium to medium deep with warm undertones and it looks soo pretty on me. as for the price, I don't know why people are complaining. a little goes such a long way that it'll last forever and you get 3g for $20 as opposed to 2.5 for $17 with benefit's mini size so its very fairly and competitively priced for what you get...its also unscented which is a plus for a lot of people. not everything will be catered to your personal makeup preferences, give brands room to breathe and experiment.",I don't get the bad reviews,28 Jul 2020,tm710,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I'm a little biased because I almost exclusively use cream products but this color is so pretty and the product is so creamy and easy to use. I don't have to worry about it looking too blushy and obvious with its sheer pigmentation. with some cream blushes you have to be so careful but not with this one. if you overdo it just keep blending and go over it with your foundation brush. it comes out perfect every time. as a bonus it looks amazing as a lip color too!,beautiful blush and lip color!,25 Jul 2020,Akry,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

Its very pretty. Make my make up look dewy and glassy,Very beautiful and natural looking,24 Jul 2020,NGOCMINHDANG,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I wanted to love this blush so bad after seeing so many reviews and loving the cream bronzer from fenty. When I got it I immediately tried it on and though it was sheer i could build it up which is fine. My biggest beef with the blush is that it wouldn’t even last 30 minutes on my face without fading away which I haven’t experienced with other cream blushes I use. I wore it with foundation and without and it faded away each time. Ended up returning which breaks my heart since I was so excited to try them. This blush was also impossible to use with a sponge I had to use a brush to be able to get any pigment on my face. It also looked a bit patchy and took too much effort to get it to look decent just for it to disappear.,,23 Jul 2020,vevers,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I love the formula of these blushes. I have Rose Latte and Summertime Wine. I have no complaints on Rose Latte, but I wish Summertime Wine didn’t have a sheen to it. If Fenty had made these without shimmer they could have been marketed as a cheek/lip product. They wear BEAUTIFULLY on the lips! I love using Rose Latte like this for a monochrome look, but with Summertime Wine it makes it look odd on my lips.",Beautiful but no shimmer would have been best.,23 Jul 2020,eleigh,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Easy to apply. I just use the Fenty portable contour brush. I bet you can use your finger, but I have somewhat patchy skin. Put little by little because you won’t see it right away.

"Okay so the formula is great and as expected. It’s creamy, it’s easy to apply with fingers or a beauty sponge, it blends out easily, it lasts. A+. 

But THIS COLOR! I was so skeptical of the color, as I am fair-light with cool-neutral undertones, and was influenced by a YouTuber who claimed this color was ace, even for lighter skin tones. I’m SO glad I took the chance. This is the most beautiful thing I have ever put on my face, I’m not even exaggerating. It makes me look like I have a perfect natural, healthy flush, like I’ve been laying on the beach in the Caribbean getting daily massages for a month. I dab it on my cheekbones, a little on the nose, a little on the forehead, and BAM, instant healthy glow. It doesn’t look at all muddy or orange. So so beautiful, and will be a forever staple in my makeup.",WOW this color!,22 Jul 2020,AmieF07,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I got the shade Bikini Martini for my tan olive toned skin and gave that 5:5 stars. Beautiful, perfect amount of pigment, left a beautiful glow. Would hands down be happy to throw out every other of my 30+ blushes and just keep that one. So I decided to get another shade in Strawberry Drip. Did not apply the same. Was a tad drying, and defiantly did not leave the same finish as Bikini Martini. Almost left a matte finish. Was way more pigmented.

"Move over Glossier Cloud Paint, there's a new cream blush in town. It's longer lasting, more pigmented and yet still looks natural on the skin. The formula is perfection and any color you get will elevate your no make up-make up look by 100.

Color-wise, If you're a light-medium skin tone the Petal Poppin' it's amazing. It's soft pink, but there's a warmth to it, and gets elevated when you're either tanned or use bronzer. I'm sure it looks amazing on darker skin, but I'm light-medium skin tone so I'm not 100% sure what that looks like, and I don't want to steer people in the wrong direction with this particular color.

"I bought 3 different shades including bikini martini. Returned the other and now this one. I decided to return drama class because it looks mauve on me which I had noticed on some reviewers as well. I just wasnt impressed or cared too much for it. It is very sheer and yes you can build it, but as you blend it fades. I have light to medium yellow undertone skin, leaning more light.

I especially love it for a glowy no makeup makeup look.. but it’s gorgeous for a full glam as well.. it melts into the  skin beautifully. It doesn’t take off your foundation and it blends so nicely.. also you can build it to be very opaque or have just a sheer wash of color...

"Wow.  I am literally wow-ing because this color (Rose Latte) looks absolutely beautiful on my skin!! This is the second color I purchased from FB cream blush collection.  The first color is Cool Berry.  I definitely love Rose latte more.  I am a medium skin shade on the lighter side.  This color has pinkish-brownish tone, and no shimmer.  I am so in love with this purchase.  This product is small, but a little goes a long way.  If anyone of you saw or bought the FB mini highlighter + fenty gloss combo - This cream blush is the exact same size as the mini highlighter from FB set.  Hope this give you a reference of what size to expect for this product. To apply - I use a kabuki shaped foundation brush or just with fingers.  The finish is so radiant, i love it for my dry/combo skin.  5 stars because of the cream blush formula and the shade rose latte.  Although its small, i am not taking off any stars for the amount of product because I feel for what the product is, the price and size is fair (could be more, but not so much of a rip off).

It's a nice, soft color that's easy to layer on bare skin, over foundation, or even on the lips as a tint. I find the small size to be quite nice as well – I agree w/others that it could've been a bit cheaper, but honestly I prefer smaller quantities of cream products in general. And in this instance, this is beneficial for me because it's buildable and blends well with both other fenty blushes and powder blushes as well (I've layered this w/the CoverFx blush in Warm Honey which is a lovely combo).

This is more of quick concealer, some bronzer then blush type of look. Very minimal. On my fair light skin its like the perfect sun kissed look. People say theres shimmer and out of a 1-10 I would say the shimmer is a 1. Its so not noticeable. I have textured cheeks and this does not accentuate it. I have normal skin so if you are extremely oily, this probably can work for you with a little powder. I just ordered rose late and the bronzer in butta biscuit.

This cream blush is AMAZING! I am very fair skinned and I loved the tone of this blush. I'm so glad I'm able to use it lightly or build it up. It works amazing with my other makeup products. Can't wait to buy other colors!!,Absolutely LOVE,26 Jun 2020,NicoleKidman,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I purchased Fuego Flush & Summertime Wine. The color payoff with Summertime Wine was absolutely beautiful on my skin tone (420) and gave me a really beautiful glow. I used Fuego Flush as a shimmer color to give me a glow/highlight because it was not a vivid color on me at all (not like a NARS Tahj Mahal)/more of a sheer wash of luminosity. I’m giving it 3-stars because it is NOT safe for sensitive skin, like mine, so after using I got a few bumps on top of the also not-so safe Pro’Filtr Hydrating Foundation. So, if you have fungal acne, avoid this product. Sad times.",Great glow but not for sensitive skin.,25 Jun 2020,WyvieA,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Definitely my favorite blush ever, I used to only wear powder blush, but I found in love with this cream blush, it’s just perfect for every occasion. Blends very well with my fenty foundation, stays on, it doesn’t fade, also love wearing it on my no make up days, this blush and mascara and ready to go",beautiful,25 Jun 2020,rosilism,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This is my third Cheeks Out cream blush. I dipped my toes in slowly, since I haven't been a fan of cream blush in the past. These are more sheer than I normally like, but you can really build the color. It's the finish that's the real star. It's smooth and glowy, without looking greasy. They don't disturb the makeup underneath, even when applied after a powder.",I keep buying these!,25 Jun 2020,bunny410,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I have tried a few cream blushes. They either took of the makeup under them, pilled up, or didn’t last at all. This is exactly what I was looking for. Applied with a brush it looks beautiful. Blends with ease. It goes on sheer but can be built up. I like a heavy handed blush look and this can be built to that with ease. Looks so beautiful on the skin. Lasting power was better than any powder blush I ever tried. The color Bikini Martini is gorgeous on my olive med to tan skin. Would like to see some more colors released in this line. The price is great. I don’t understand all the negative reviews on that. The compact is small but you only need the smallest amount of product. Perfect summer time blush. Will be back for more trying the bronzer as well. I am 41 with dry skin and enlarged pores. This looks so beautiful and doesn’t give me that dry polka dot effect that powder blush can give me.",Perfect on aging skin,23 Jun 2020,CWebRN78,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
These are great cream blushes especially if you are just getting into cream products like myself. You can wear them more sheer or build them up for more color payoff if you like. I always start with a small amount and add more as needed and they blend really well. The only downside is they are kind of small compared to the size of the cream bronzers (which are absolutely beautiful as well) I am glad I purchased them both!,Beginner Friendly,22 Jun 2020,skh415,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I have 3 of them and they made my skin look greasy. I really wanted a blush for the summer so this was perfect. But the color didn’t show up up on my 400 skin. It did move my make up.

Love this blush!! its my new go to! I thought it would be a bit risky picking this shade as I wasn't sure if it would show up on my skin tone but it totally does. It gives a nice flush of pink and adds a youthful glow. I also appreciate how I can build it up if I want my blush to stand out more.

"I was really disappointed with this blush. It's heavily pigmented, which is nice, but the texture is very stiff and it does not blend well at all. I tried dappling it on with fingertips, smoothing with a blender, even just a good rub, but it always ended up looking clowny. I threw it away.","Disappointing, bad texture.",20 Jun 2020,hazyd,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"AMAZING!! These reminded me of how much I LOVE cream blushes!! Used to be all that I used but moved onto powders for the winter. I’ll admit I was surprised by the size of the packaging. It’s smaller than the palm of my hand. But once I used it I completely understand. I simply pat my finger into the blush and tap onto cheeks. Blends beautifully. Not too 
pigmented and doesn’t pick up the products underneath. And if you choose to layer a powder blush on top this is a great base for that. I have 7/10 of the shades and they’re all great but this shade in particular never lets me down. Has a gorgeous shimmer and gives you a healthy natural flush. If you’ve never tried cream blushes before I highly recommend giving this a shot and just be patient as it does take time to figure out how you like to apply and what works best with your skin.",,20 Jun 2020,ChanelN05,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Thought I would try this on a whim, as I like cream blushes especially in summer. I got this rose latte and also Daiquiri Dip. I use the rose latte for a light bronze effect on cheekbones and bridge of nose and Daiquiri Dip for a little more color on the cheeks. They apply like a dream with an angled brush and I love the sheerness of them. I don't like the clown look. Yes they are sheer, I think they could be made bolder with layers, but I like them as sheer. These will last a very long time. Today I used them without foundation and they blended easily, no streaking.   I highly recommend if you like a natural glow.",Best cream blushes in a long time,19 Jun 2020,twingrandma,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I am new to cream products — and a bit reticent to switch over from my beloved powders. But this formula made that change really easy and it looks SO GOOD and natural.

"I purchased two colors - Crush on Cupid and Drama Cla$$.  I wanted a blush that would look more natural on hot, humid days when I don't want to wear foundation or powder, but I want a nice color on my cheeks.  Drama Cla$$ barely showed up on my skin (light to medium, with pink undertones).  To get any amount of color, I had to use A LOT of it...but within three to four hours, it looked like I didn't have any color on my cheeks.

The other color (Crush on Cupid) does much better, though.  And again, I live in the south where it's hot and humid right now, and the last thing I want to wear is powdery blush that melts off.  This blush is great for a natural pop of color that allows your dewy skin to come through.","Nice blush, wrong color",17 Jun 2020,iahawkeye,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
This blush is THE ISH. I always have a hard time finding a good blush. I can wear it with or without foundation.,,17 Jun 2020,Mhill93,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This is my first ever cream blush!  The color petal poppin is perfect for my skintone (light with yellow undertone) and it goes on so nicely.  I applied with a sponge and it took some time to build up.  I love that I was able to build it up to my liking and place it just where I wanted it to go.  I might get the fenty brush to see if applies better but it worked just with the sponge as well! It is very very small though, not sure how long it will last.  But I absolutely love the color and cannot wait to try more colors.",Love Petal Poppin,17 Jun 2020,pg10,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I saw Jacki Aina review these blushes and LOVED this look on her. She said it perfectly ""it's like if the 90s were dewy"".

"I am in love with this color! I enjoy that this blush takes some building up because going crazy with blush is so easy. I like the texture of this cream and it is long lasting on my skin.

"But I don't have a problem with the size at all.  I think this particular shade is deep enough to not need to over apply.  I also think using the right brush goes a long way.  I enjoy the formula very much, it doesn't stay sticky on the face.  I don't think however that I'll get another shades though, they're just not my preference of colors.  I hope they expand into more neutral / natural shades",I may be the odd one out,15 Jun 2020,suej27,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"It looks more like a bubblegum pink but don’t be intimidated- it goes on much softer and gives a natural colour. I am a medium skinned black girl so a bright pink would definitely be scary to try but I do not regret my purchase. You can apply with anything (I use a sponge) and get great results! You can build it for more colour and you can use it anywhere, hence it being “freestyle”. Give it a go!",Try it out!,15 Jun 2020,nascba,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"It’s not even that it’s tiny, but it doesn’t actually last for that long. The colour it self is gorgeous and packaging is fantastic so 3 points for that. However, even for a cream blush it is tiny. Just my personal opinion and it is based on the number of the times I have worn it since purchase (at least 6 times) you do have to use a decent amount of product to get the desired amount of colour. So I don’t think that a little goes a long way. Sorry. Not worth the hype.",Not bad but not worth it,14 Jun 2020,LadyFaria,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This is a really lovely orange blush. It reminds me the Em Cosmetics' blush in Faded Clementine. I would recommend this though because despite the small size, it really doesn't take a ton of product to get a lovely shimmery flush.

If you are someone who has deeper skin, i.e. tan-deep and up, I might not recommend this over the other blushes as it isn't as pigmented in my opinion. It could still give a lovely highlighter look but if you want a ""blush"", I don't think this will do the trick. This is a nice, fun summer color in my opinion and I love layering it on top of some of the other colors like Rose Latte or Strawberry Drip for a more glowy, golden hour-esque look.","Stunning, but likely will need to pack it on",14 Jun 2020,appleofmyivy,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

Nice formula but not enough pigment! I bought this cotton candy shade( bikini martini) because I want it to show up on my cheek close the actual color of the product! I’m not the barely there blush kind of gal lol. If you like subtle blush then it may work for you. I’m gonna try to build it up more but it’s a cream so will see.,Wish it was as bright as it looks,12 Jun 2020,AMW80,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Good formula but wish it was more pigmented. I think anyone with the balls to buy a bright purple blush expect it to show bright purple on the cheek. Maybe just me?,,12 Jun 2020,AMW80,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This really is the perfect sun kissed shade on cheeks, I like bringing it over the bridge of my nose too. Blends seamlessly whether I want a sheer wash of color or more intensity, both looks wear great with this. I appreciate the versatility of this product a lot and would like to buy another shade. I set with a little bit of setting powder and it lasts all day.",very happy with this,12 Jun 2020,AlexandraFM,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Haha I did not pay attention to the size, reminds me of play makeup for kids. Color pay off isnt bad, and you can build up the pigment through layering the product on.

"This is a sheer blush that applies well with both a brush and fingers. Once applied it dries down to a perfect skin like flush. I have oily skin and this blush lasts all day, even with summer heat and under a face mask. The blush did not clog my pores or create texture. I noticed several reviews complaining about the size and I am a little surprised since this cream blush is roughly the same size as many other cream blushes on the market. However, the blush is much smaller than the full size bronzer. Since you would use such a tiny amount on each application I think this blush would last for at least a year.",Perfection,12 Jun 2020,cde1228,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
This has to be my favorite shade. I thought it wouldn’t work for me because I’m so pale. But I had to try it! I love it! It’s a warm nude color and I think it works well on my pale skin!

"I see everyone and their mother talking about the size that it’s a secret, I could tell they were small from pictures and the weight. If you think it’s worth it (Fenty, packaging, quality) then purchase it! But let’s review the QUALITY. These are great! I normally don’t wear foundation and these blend great right onto my skin and powder highlighter doesn’t look weird or chunky on top. I have also worn these on top of foundation and they don’t emphasize dryness or pores. I personally think these are worth the money because I really don’t use a lot when I use these. I can use my finger and just pat on my cheek and I get enough payoff. I don’t think it’s any less product than a normal liquid blush. I will say I have seen some people with dark/deep skin use this and it seems like the color payoff isn’t as good (I have very fair skin). I would recommend swatching them first if possible if that is the case for you!","let’s talk about the product, not the size",12 Jun 2020,LizPizz,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

One thing I will say: I keep seeing reviews everywhere online that describe it as ""sheer,"" and I would have to disagree with that. Granted, I am a very naturally pale person, but even with a very light application, I have to use very, very little and diffuse the edges carefully. This isn't a bad thing at all, I'd just like to point that out for other pale people like me: don't go in whole ham. Build it slowly. For a cream formula, it also wears well and doesn't fade quickly like other blushes can. I have two shades which are both beautiful. I'd definitely be up for trying other colors in the range.",Very pigmented!,11 Jun 2020,Lareveuse,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"Color: Rose Latte. This shade is described as ""soft bronzed nude,"" but the color is much more intense than that--it's closer to a dark terra cotta, at least on me. I'm pale and I really like the color, but I think it would be amazing on someone with a warmer complexion and deeper skin tones. The texture is very creamy--it definitely takes a little smoothing to work into the skin. (Side note: I use my fingertips to apply this product.) But the product has good staying power.

"Love! Love! Love!  Rosé latte is my favorite shade in this blush!  It’s like a natural looking flush on dark skin. The colors are sheer and buildable which is what I like about it. I apply this with clean fingers for best results. I noticed some complaints about the pan size, but I could tell it was small when I ordered it so I’m ok with the size. Maybe wish the price was a little less.",,11 Jun 2020,indigodiva,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"This cream blush is a great combination of pink and peach to give a subtle glow.  The texture is smooth and goes on evenly with a beauty blender or using my fingers to gently pat onto the apples of my cheeks.  Long lasting after being set with a little powder.  One of the nicest cream blushes I have tried!  

My only complaint is the size.  Sephora packed it in a huge box and it is so small it could have been sent in a padded envelope without issue.  $20 is a lot to spend on such a small item so I will have to see how long it lasts before I pass judgment if I will repurchase.",HopIng a little goes a long way....,11 Jun 2020,EmmiePoo,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I am so obsessed with this blush! I have it in Strawberry Drip and Daiquiri Drip as well, but I think this is my favorite shade. I have a lighter skin tone, and this feels so natural but you can definitely build it up to get a bolder look—something I love that you can do with any of the shades, regardless of how intense they look in the pan (*cough*daiquiri drip*cough**cough*)! I typically use a damp beauty sponge, but on occasion I’ll just throw it on quickly with my fingers and it blends out really nicely either way. My skin is really oily but it stays on throughout the day and doesn’t seem to fade.

"Yes, I'm light-skinned and bought the brightest color blush. It looks fantastic on me and I LOVE it. I am a cream blush kind of girl and have many high-end cream blushes. This is better than my recent favorite by Laura Mercier. It's creamy, sheer, buildable, and basically the perfect cream blush formula. I'm going to grab a few more colors. Don't worry about the brightness of this blush. It looks amazing on fair to light skin, like Snow White level blush. I assume this will also be awesome on darker skin tones as well. If you love cream blush and love a realistic looking flush then grab this!",Snow White Level,9 Jun 2020,AJBorghi,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I absolutely love and adore this Fenty Beauty Cheeks Out Cream Blush and must say hands down it's the best blush I have found yet. I'm 68 years young and believe me, I've tried them all. I thought I had found my fave with Nars liquid Orgasm but that can cast an orangish glow that just doesn't look best with my ultra-pale snow-white skin. I have Bikini Martini, a super pale cool pink that blends perfectly with either my fingers or a small stipple brush. There is no way you can over-do this cream blush which I find works much better on my normal but slightly aging skin. Far from looking like a clown with most blushes, it goes on sheer but it's buildable with only a few dabs of my finger or brush. I only use Dr. Jart's BB cream on a daily basis, but even with a full face of makeup using Marc Jacobs foundation, it does not interfere with a primed moisturized base. Very long lasting as well. As to the reviews stating unhappiness with the size, I have never really used up an entire blush and I feel it's the perfect size for the price, anything larger runs the risk of drying out too soon. I'm back today to buy Petal Poppin' which seems to have more of a coral-pink hue to it. I anticipate both lasting me quite some time and I'm so happy I took a chance on Fenty, it definitely rocks!

On days when I want more of a natural look, I also use the littlest bit on my eyelids for just a bit of colour without all the sparkle and glitter and whatnot.

This is a very natural blush – I have to build it up quite a bit so it actually shows up on my cheeks. I’m not mad at it though, just be aware. I use either a sponge or my fingers to apply. It looks great with a cream bronzer, my whole face looks naturally glowy. It is quite small, as everyone says. Dries down, doesn’t leave your face tacky.

It melts right into my foundation and is so easy to build on. It doesn’t leave my skin and lasts my whole day. When I first swatched it, I was worried it wouldn’t match my skin well and it seemed too sheer. However, I was proven wrong when it matched so well and you can never make the mistake of adding too much blush. Even when I put my Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Finish Powder over it, it stayed creamy and didn’t patch in any way!

I love the overall texture and color pay off. My only reason for giving 3 stars is that the size of it is so small.

I can just put a bit to add some color to my face or more when I do a full glam. I dont put highlighter with this blush, I feel like it gives you a new dewy shine on your cheeks so you dont need it. Those are perfect for summer. I did had trouble applying it with a sponge once but I think my sponge was too wet to use so my fault. I personally love applying it with my finger and then blend it in and if I want it to look more like my skin I blend it with a brush. love this blush.",love it!,31 May 2020,katie012,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"While the colors are bright and pigmented in-pan, what is great is that they are easily blended into a soft wash of color. Blending doesn't mush around your face makeup either-- and I was wearing primer and foundation! Applying with your fingers is the easiest way and you can tap and rub the color to blend the way you want.
Extremely impressed with the ease of use and the vitality it brings to my face. The price point is nice too; while the pans are small, you don't need a lot.",Blown away,31 May 2020,krastins,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

After EVERYONE saying the color payoff wasn’t there, I went in hard with this color.  Maybe those folks should try this shade because my cheeks looked like fire!!!  I know I’m fair skinned, but I don’t like simple pink and light blushes, I love color!!  And this has color!

It's a bit smaller than the average blush, but it's definitely not sample size like I've heard some people say. If this product was $30 or over, I might be upset, but at this price point I'm not mad about the size. I plan on purchasing more shades.",,29 May 2020,laurenlenaye,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Fantastic color payoff with a perfect pigment. Never mind the small size of the product because you truly need barely any to get results. The finish is dewy and natural and the product blends so easily even with just my fingers and using a patting motion around my cheekbones. Don't like the brightness of the color in the pan scare you off. once it's on your skin it's like a very subtle natural glow. Def new staple and converted me to cream blushes for that all over dewy look.,Umm amazing !!!,29 May 2020,juicygirl35,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This was a very pretty color but it just didn't last on the cheeks. I have dry skin for reference, and this isn't usually a problem for me. On bare skin it will last about 6 hours, but if I have any kind of a base on, it will only last barely 5 hours. I tried it over a couple different foundations. Also, this looked kinda funny on bare skin. I like a cream blush mostly for days I'm not wearing any kind of foundation/ BB cream, but this product on bare skin looked unnatural.",,29 May 2020,suzyo,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I have tried applying it with my fingers, a sponge and a brush. I would definitely say that brush application is the best. I didn't purchase the brush from fenty because I already had something similar in my collection. as long as it's a dense angled brush, it will work just fine.

I love love love this product! Watched rawbeautykristi’s video before I purchased it and she was the one that sold me on it honestly. I got mine 30% off on the fenty sale but would be willing to pay full price. I have light skin and petal poppin definitely complimented my skin tone. Size didn’t bother me much as a little went a long way and will be enough for a while. Only con is that it does trap any sort of dust or fiber from brush or sponge and it gets messy in the pan but since I’m the only one using it doesn’t bother me much.,new staple,29 May 2020,PinkStarburst,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I Hate that the size is getting most of the attention but formula wise this blush is AMAZING!! I had tried a drugstore cream blush years ago and never bought another cream blush again, but after trying the Fenty blush I am now a HUGE fan. I was steered away with fears of my base/foundation products being removed like the one I had previously tried but this doesn’t do that at all. The color petal poppin is good, but can be a borderline subtle on my medium-tan skin tone from Fenty 255-300. Built up it pops more for a more everyday shade but I would like to try the more intense shades. I was also nervous how it would hold up on my oily skin but this didn’t make me anymore oily at all. It’s super lightweight, Gives a glow but doesn’t transfer,  and sets after a min. Blends extremely easily and I can see this lasting a while even though it’s small and for the price is actually not too bad considering I’ve been able to pick them up on sale. I don’t regret purchasing this all and can definitely see myself purchasing more shades.",Small but packs a punch!,29 May 2020,Marbellaaa,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
The most perfect texture and tone. Damn damn. It’s a deep  terracotta brown and is much more pigmented than I exepcted. It’s the second blush I have ever purchased as I am not big on blush but it’s definitely a new staple!,,28 May 2020,TessaKattz,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Pros: super creamy, good payoff (you can build it up without any issues), super dewy
Cons: SUPER small

Extremely small pan size. Applies well with a beauty blender. Doesn’t have a long wear time. Just eh.,Eh,28 May 2020,tasc0318,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This blush blends so well! I really love how easy this is to apply with my fingers.I also love how it gives me a natural flush, like I just spent the day out in the sun. I've read a lot of reviews complaining about the size, but I think anyone who has bought other cream blushes like (rms or tata harper) would know that cream blushes tend to come in small containers.",Summer Look,28 May 2020,yadira92,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"My first cream product and I really like it. I’m not sure why the size is a point of contention because you barely need any. I press my sponge in there once and I get enough product to use for a cheek. It’s buildable, again u need a very small amount. I use a tinted moisturizer. And use very little powder to set because I am oily. And I find this blends great, I don’t get patches. It looks very natural which is what I was looking for. I wanted something that would be easy for the summer. For someone who has never used creams before I would say this is beginner friendly. Very happy with this product",pleasantly surprised,28 May 2020,AngieLoves,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Not a fan. First things first—it’s teeny tiny. Ridiculous size for a blush and my brush didn’t even fully fit in it. The formula is thick like a lip balm, and nearly impossible to apply. The color is beautiful though. If it were a bit creamier, and bigger for the price, it would be great.",TINY,27 May 2020,Laurenmartinss2,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Don’t be afraid of this color! It does on super sheer and gives you such a nice glow .... comes off a lot more pinky than purple!!,Love! Don’t be afraid!,27 May 2020,Stephhhhf,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"For reference, I wear Fenty shade 320. I actually liked this blush a lot. It is slightly sheer so it gives me a natural flush of color but can be built up to look more pigmented. I personally love this shade because it is more of a nude blush and I don't like looking too pink. The only downside is that the pan is too small imo.",Perfect for summer,27 May 2020,VK92,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
This is beautiful! It really makes the skin look so fresh and glowly. It’s really pigmented but then it also blends out so well. It’s the perfect cream blush formula!,Gorgeous,27 May 2020,mizzyruth,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I gave this a good few weeks before I decided to write this. These are wonderful. Yes the product size is small but you need a small amount to get color pay off. THESE ARE PIGMENTED! I need more colors. They work great over powder. They also blend so easy with fingers as well. Get one shade and try it. I am buying more.,Love These,27 May 2020,Dominoluvsu,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"To preface: yes, these are very small.  I think that the price reflects that though, and I don't need very much product per application so the size is not an issue for me at all.
I have two shades: Rose Latte and Petal Poppin.  I love both shades and often use them together.  Rose Latte is a beautiful, bronzy rose, and Petal Poppin is a warm pink.  I often lay down Rose Latte and then apply Petal Poppin on the apples of my cheeks.  Even layered on top of each other, and usually layered over the Fenty cream bronzer, I don't find that I have any issue with my foundation being moved around or buffed away underneath.  I find that these blushes are very pigmented on my fair-light skin so I use a whispy synthetic brush for application and slowly build up the colour.",,27 May 2020,Albs,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
This is honestly the best cream blush ever i am definitely obsessed.. you can just lightly apply it with your fingers or brush and it gives you the nicest and healthiest look ever! You can build it as u need and thats the best part .. i think i love it even more then regular blushes now! I cant wait to get my hands on more shades - for now i ordered 2 but definitely want more! Its amazing!!!! This is coming from someone who doesnt like cream products and is a powder only person!,THE BEST CREAM BLUSH EVER!!!!,26 May 2020,harveenxo,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I was hesitant to purchase considering all of the fuss such as “this product is mini size”, I really don’t think I will ever hit pan on this product. This cream blush is pigmented (I use a stippling brush with tapping motions on my cheeks) and is very buildable. I am obsessed with this colour!!! Very bright and youthful. I find that layering a thin layer of a similar blush colour to set and build on the colour works best. I find this works best with a long day wear and it truly lasted over 8 hours with minimal fade of colour :)",A Beginner of Cream Blush Recommends,26 May 2020,lesliethia,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I was initially more excited about fenty’s blush than their bronzer but I actually prefer the bronzer more. this formula is fantastic but I have this colour for a much cheaper price from maybelline. I think next I’ll buy the dark purple shade for something new and it lasts a long time but I think for most people, this pink shade is a staple already in their collections. I would recommend going for the orange or purple for it to be worth the money.",It’s great but...,26 May 2020,DaynaMacDonald,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I have fair skin and it shows up well on me and last a decent amount of time. I took a star off because the small amount of product you get in it will make it less worthy for someone who needs to build it for the color to show.,For fair skin mostly,26 May 2020,MarieLem,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I LOVE this product. I've been on the cream blush wave recently and this came just in time. You need just the smallest amount to give your cheeks a flush, so no need to pack your brush or finger.

"WOW! first of all this is my first review ever for Sephora so clap clap. I really felt motivated to write this review because I feel as though its not being given the glory it deserves. I order this shade right when the product dropped and it took forever to get to me. In the mean time i was watching reviews and reading them on here and I started to get scared, because the reviews were not good. I've been told that I would shade 400 in fenty (I do not wear foundation) and the reviews were saying its too sheer to show up on deep skin tones! Well I am here to say this is not true. If you are looking for a nice golden glow you gotta get this shade, its the perfect highlighter for us brown girls. I was disappointed in how small it is but its okay cause a little goes a long way. I am a concealer, good highlight kinda gal. So for me this is exactly what I was going for as far as a highlight.",DO NOT PASS UP ON THIS,26 May 2020,sjayinthehouse,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"This is very sheer and pretty.  Bikini Martini shade is not as bright pink as it seems and not too pigmented.  It can be easily built up though.  If you enjoy cream blush, this one is good.  I like that it doesn't come in a tube because I can just dip my brush straight into the product.  It comes in at a close second to Honest Beauty creme blush which in my opinion is the very best.",Very good,25 May 2020,Lippies66,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I’ve had this product for about a week now and I’ve used it every day since it arrived- I’m obsessed! I will admit I was a little thrown off by its small size (the pot is the same size as advertised minis from other brands) but once I started using it I could see that a little goes a long way. I’ve been using it by dipping a big fluffy brush in, and I don’t usually need to go back in once I spread it over my cheeks. The formula is great and this color is GORGEOUS! I went a little bit deeper than I usually would (my regular powder blush is similar to petal poppin) and it’s a gorgeous natural looking flush, almost like I spent a couple of hours in the sun:) I love it so much!

"The formula is nice and buildable, but the shade Fuego Flush is best used as a highlighter on deeper skin tones, rather than a blush. After a few hours, it looks like a bunch of glitter. I'm not sure what I was expecting with this shade, but it was not that.  I have oily, acne-prone skin, and I do not think the blushes reacted negatively to my skin, so I will definitely buy more shades. I also have Rosė Latte and I think that shade looks great on me, so the product itself is worth a try.

"I wanted to love this product so badly, the size and pigmentation is exactly what I expected (can't expect a full size for $20) and the formula is soooo easy to blend and very natural looking , feels like my skin!

I wore this out for the first time and after a few hours of errands they were completely off (I forgot setting spray)

Today I did one cheek with a similar color from glossier cream blush and one cheek with this and put setting spray on both. After a few hours the colors are still there but half of them are gone compare to glossier cheek (my face touching rate is close to 0 since the pandemic )

I did try to build and used fingers, but just blended away. Imay try a similar shade from another brand to get better color pay off. I have light to medium skin with warm undertones.

"I am in love. This is such a beautiful cream blush, beautiful formula. Not sure why everyone is bothered by the size, for me it’s a normal size blush. Realistically how many people hit pan on blushes before they go bad? I know I have never hit pan on any of my blushes.

"Compared to some other cream blushes on the market, I didn't love this one. I do love the color range and think the size is so cute, but the formula really needs to be warmed up to blend nicely and because the colors are so bright, a good blend is really important. It was a little bit of a struggle to get the mix of blend and color payoff that I wanted with this as it sheered out pretty quickly too. Would buy another if it was a color I couldn't find elsewhere, but otherwise, I doubt I'd try another one. I do LOVE the Fenty cream bronzer, so not sure why this didn't work as well for me.","Lovely colors, but didn't love the application",21 May 2020,nins1234,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I am a huge fan of cream products to start with so seeing a creme blush in this style component definitely intrigued me. I was definitely late to the game so the shade I had my eyes on is sold out but I decided to give Summertime Wine a shot, Its a really nice berry toned blush with slight brown base and very fine shimmer. This is a product that's very creamy and semi dewy. Very user friendly and blends very easily. I found the size of this product to be just fine, due to it being so bold and pigmented this will last me a very long time, lets be real I cant remember the last time I used up a blush fully. It's really nice blended with a brush, sponge or fingers. I really love this shade and I'm glad I went out of my comfort zone instead of getting a shade I usually use. Mine did have sweating on it when I received it in the mail but that's due to the temperature being hot out, the product worked great and I just dabbed it off with a piece of tissue.",Worth it!,20 May 2020,sabrinacasto97,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

And you don’t need to use a light hand as it’s fairly sheer, but can be built up for a brighter, more vibrant look. Would work well with a tan.

I use this with the other liquid and cream products I use on my fave before I powder and it’s great for making your blush last all day. I would say the staying power is amazing with this and it really pops out under your powder even if you don’t have a blush on top of it so if you want a more subtle pop of color you can achieve it with this. It also doesn’t cake under your makeup which is a big thing for me with cream blushes. I recommend it.,beautiful pop of pink,20 May 2020,taty2490,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"The formula of these blushes is FANTASTIC! They lay on the skin perfectly and give you that slightly translucent blush glow on your cheeks. You can tell this formula won’t slide around on your face during the day, it stays out. I unfortunately chose two colors that didn’t give me what I wanted. I picked petal poppin thinking it’s be a brightish coral baby pink and rose latte expecting a deeper bronze rose color. These two shades literally looked exactly the same on my cheeks!

"I like to use both cream and powder blushes, but in the summer with the glowy complexion I prefer, I like to use cream/liquid in contour, bronze and blush. 
I powder/set only under my eyes and nose and around my mouth, after applying all the cream bases. This one (I love NDs cream blushes) is on par with my favourites, for blend-ability and intensity. Using a small brush or the fat end of a sponge, I pounce it lightly on my cheeks until I get the depth I want. Don't dip your brush or sponge too deeply, start slow and build. I've also heard, that since blush is one of the first items to fade, if you layer powder blush over cream, it lasts longer; once the powder fades, the cream is still visible.

I will say it is more pigmented when I apply with my fingers instead of with a brush, the brush seemed to fade it out a lot no matter how much I applied.

"I was so excited to try this as I'd been hunting for an orange blush and I love cream products. I like sheer, but this barely has any colour once blended onto the cheeks. It leaves behind nothing but very visible gold shimmer all over the cheeks, and the colour fades away incredibly fast, even on dry skin. I have fair neutral leaning warm skin and this blush didn't look good at all because it's a very yellow toned orange. It flattered my mother much better and she has a tanned yellow complexion.

"Beautiful colour, I was worried when I saw how dark the colour was in the pan but it sheers out easily and looks very natural. On the face it has a very skin like finish, and this colour specifically looks very much like a sun flush. My gripe with it is the longevity, generally after a couple of hours it will have disappeared completely off my face. I am someone with oily skin however so not entirely surprising for a cream product, but I’ve also worn cream blushes that  last longer than this. I don’t personally have an issue with the size as I like to use different blushes frequently and cream products don’t last long anyways, but I will say even though I was expecting it to be small it still surprised me with how small it truly is. Because of the size, it’s kind of hard getting a brush in there and it gets the packaging pretty dirty. Overall happy with the quality and though it’s not as long lasting as I would like I will probably pick up more.",Good quality but not long lasting,13 May 2020,sativaplath,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This is my favorite blush I've EVER used. I had looked at quite a few options before settling on this - and it's perfect. If you want to fake that ""sunburn"" look, this is the blush for you. It's so natural, doesn't accentuate pores, and it GENUINELY looks like a natural flush or like you got too much sun. Yes, this is small, but I wasn't as shocked as others seem to be by the size. It lasts all day and you only need the smallest amount. I just use my fingers to apply, and it's incredibly easy to blend. No tools needed. 

I will continue to buy this. I have very sensitive skin and so far no breakouts. I have been using for over a week.

"I know these are marketed as sheer but for darker skin complexions, “sheer” needs way more pigment. In order to get the blush to show up I have to use a lot more product and by the time I get it to show up, there’s no point because it looks super oily. I’m combo skin so oil is my worst enemy. For reference, I’m Fenty 385 and Estée Lauder 5W2 so I’m not even the darkest on the spectrum! If I can’t use it then anyone darker than me will not be able to get this to work for them. Also this fades super quick :/ I applied one side with my fingers and the other with a brush and I think it’s better to tap it in with your fingers because it can make your foundation move around with a brush. (Pretty obvious since I didn’t set my face lol) but overall not super satisfied, especially since it’s so small.

I love fenty products but I’m really on the fence about this product. It gave me a sheen but even after building it up it wasn’t enough pigment to look like I’m wearing anything. Fuego flush is like a translucent sheen on my skin. My skin is paler than usual as were quarantined so I’m really not sure if I’ll be keeping this.

Gorgeous colors in the pan - but does not show up on darker skin. To reference I am Estee Lauder Double Wear Bronze (5W). Fuego Flush did not show up at all, though i can wear as a highlight (golden hues) It is advertised correctly as a SHEER blush. Definitely build-able but you will use a lot of product.

"As with my review for the bronzer, I have to admit that I’m totally enamored with these new cream blushes. I have not typically been a fan of cream blushes; although I have dry skin, I often find that cream blushes & bronzers have a tendency of settling into any texture on my skin, and can often look patchy. Not this guy. The texture is almost balm-like, and layers beautifully onto the skin. I know there have been complaints about how sheer the product is, but that’s the beauty of the blush! Drama Cla$$ looks like an unwearable violet shade, but it actually comes off as this beautiful cool-toned berry pink that’s fresh and radiant. I also have the shade Strawberry Drip, and it also gives a fresh reddish-pink sheen fo the cheeks. The blush may be small, but the result isn’t.",,11 May 2020,ellesimone,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I'm really pretty disappointed in this. it's a nice color but the formula is so faint - you really have to build it up to make it visible. But I can't get past the COMICALLY SMALL size.

The product is beautiful in the pan and on a swatch but for a cream blush for some reason not that much colour once applied and blended out. It almost works as a highlighter.

"I love the concept of a cream blush under the Fenty line, however this one is a miss. This tangerine color would look beautiful on my skin tone (I wear 320/330 in the Fenty foundations) however the color barely shows up. In the pan it looks beautiful with a very light shimmer but somehow the finish is slightly greasy without much color payoff when applied to the cheeks, which is disappointing. I've heard that its buildable but building it up only gives slightly more color that does not last and too much grease. 

I really wish they would release blush tones without shimmer (or a very small amount) in the form of Match Stix. The formula for the Stix is slightly dry but excellent for staying power and color payoff.","Pretty Colors, but Greasy with No Color Payoff",10 May 2020,8ari8,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I honestly just don't like the product. I have a MAC blush (Glow Play Brush) I purchased not to long ago and it's absolutely beautiful. It's cream, blendable, doesn't take your makeup off and gives the right amount of pigment. However, this fenty product is nothing to write home about. Summertime Wine shows up but I didn't find it super blendable (I used a beauty blender and brush). It absolutely takes your makeup off as well. I was told it's better to use this product with no makeup but then I'll just rather not use it at all.

"Alright so I get the gripe about the size. I was fully prepared to receive something tiny and even then I laughed a little when I realized it actually did look like a sample size. HOWEVER, I don’t think people are fully equating the amount of product you receive to the price? A NARS blush will run you $30 and while the packaging might be slightly bigger you’re hardly receiving more product. Also these colors, wow! Yes they are sheer but definitely buildable! Don’t think half of these would work in any other formulation. I’d definitely do my research on how the color you’re interested in will show up for your skin tone. To that I’m glad I got rosé latte instead of fuego flush although I’m still tempted to try that one out. I built it up on my brush a little before applying and holy color! I looked like I had a full on sunburn but a little blending and I hopped on FaceTime and everyone told me I looked glowy :) haven’t fully tested the staying power yet as I haven’t had much of anywhere to go but will definitely be in my summer rotation",I love it despite the downfalls,10 May 2020,HennaSays,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I bought peddle poppin, cool berry and rose latte. All fantastic! I don't like wearing powder and prefer a natural look having my skin show through a bit and these are all beautiful on my fair, freckled skin! fresh and clean skin rather than a powdery mask! Will definitely buy this again! 
if you're unsure of colors, just go on YouTube. that's how I chose mine :-)",Love all 3!,8 May 2020,seaseab,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"RiRi killed it once again with another amazing product. I love everything about this blush. I love the color, the fact that it goes over powder perfectly without disturbing anything, that it doesn’t emphasize my texture and that it really doesn’t feel sticky. It almost dries down like a powder. Daiquiri Dip looks great on my tan skin! I’m definitely purchasing a few more colors.",,8 May 2020,LizzAG98,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I purchased this at launch and I was super excited to try Fenty’s cream blush. It claims to be a light wash of colour, and it is - very natural looking on the skin, with a slight glow. 
The downside? It’s tiny. It’s ridiculously tiny. It fits in the palm of my hand and that’s just the packaging, never mind the product.
I’m not disappointed in the formula, or the purchase, I’m disappointed in the size. (My fault, too excited to see how much is actually in the product). 
Again, it is a beautiful shade and it is easy to blend and apply (even over powder). 
I just wish it wasn’t so small ._.","Full Price, Sample Size?",8 May 2020,JoodleZoodle,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"Beautiful, but unfortunately it faded within the hour.  Too good to be true!",Where did you go?,8 May 2020,yinyang,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Love it! Goes on very nicely, blends well over powder (stipple it don’t swipe it) and under powder as well (when you put a setting powder over it, it changes the look of it! So give it a try!). To everyone that complains about the amount of product, it’s gonna expire so you should be using it within the 1 year time span of its life. You really don’t need a lot of the product in my experience. I have tangerine, rose latte and petal poppin, all go on nicely. To everyone that complains about the pigment, look at the description of the blushes. It says “Cool Berry - Soft Mauve....” key word is SOFT. I’m a medium skin tone so for me, a few dips in the pan and I’m good. Some of these colours won’t look good on dark tones, and some won’t look good on light tones. But it’s what you prefer. They’re a soft blush, you’re not gonna get a crazy pigment from some of the colours. The way I use these, I use a brush to apply it and then I go in with my damp beauty blender to blend it in seamlessly. If you’re unsure about the pigment for your skin tone, go on YouTube, there’s a review for these under every skin stone I believe (RawBeautyKristi - light skin tone, Alissa Ashley - medium/dark skin tone, Jackie Aina - dark skin tone, Ohemaa - dark skin tone)","Nice pigment, blends well!

"Not impressed with how tiny this product is. This is a trial size I would expect to get for 100-250 points. There is only 3g of product. By comparison to another cream blush the Too Faced Peach My Cheeks ones were 12.5g and those felt small. I am heavily considered returning because I don't feel I got my money's worth for this small amount product I purchased.

"I am not a blush wearer so when I do I wear it  Iwant it to look natural. This is a nice wash of color that gives a healthy look to the face. If you are one of those girl who likes a full face hollywood beat. This might not be for you.

"Gorgeous! The wash of colour you pick up from one or two swirls is the perfect amount of product. I bought this specifically for natural makeup days (so basically anytime I apply makeup these days) and it is just enough for me. You can definitely layer this blush to turn up the colour if you need to as well. 

I have the shade Petal Poppin and at first I worried that it would be too bright on my skin tone, but it honestly just gives me such a natural flush plus lasts at least 6 hours. I also swiped and blended this into my lids for a nice monochromatic look. I love that I can use this for my eyes as well!

For those complaining of the sample sized product they received, nobody was hiding the weight of the product, it is very clearly stated, as is the bronzer. Definitely not the same size. I’m ok with this because I cannot think of a single blush that I’ve ever finished!",i love it!,7 May 2020,debstewie,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I was so intrugued by this color that I bought it, and I am fair-medium skin with a few broken cappilaries on my cheeks and it looks great!  Sort of blends with my pinkish skin and just gives this very cool glow with a pinkish/violet sheen.  You can build it to get the color payoff but I like that it is a sheer wash.  Very happy, I am over 50 and creams work better for wrinkles - haha!  Indulge - makeup should be fun!",this worked for me - over 50 fair skinned customer,6 May 2020,chicagobrrr,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Beyond disappointed. Wayyyyyy too small. I thought I purchased a full size product. I opened it to see the color at least to give it another try and it’s too dark. It’s like purple almost.

"I am very much into the whole “makeup,no makeup” look. I tend to skip the blush because it’s just not my thing and looks unnatural to me. So for whatever reason, I decided to try the Fenty cream blush and I must say that I love the sheerness of this product, the pigment is there but it’s not too heavy. I suggest Rosé Latte for people who do not like a heavily pigmented vibrant blush. The formula is pretty smooth and creamy too. The only thing I dislike is the size of the compact. I wish it was the size of the bronzers and highlighters.",It is tiny but cute...,6 May 2020,DaniLyne,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I swatched it on my wrist and then I tried it on my face .. and wow is all I can say , a tiny bit and I looked fresh and lovely . It is very pigmented and honestly I know everyone is commenting on how small it is and how little product , but im not mad about that , you need a tiny drop .. not sure about the other shades but this one is very pigmented and it is very rose , like a dark pink . I did my makeup like usual today , but popped this on my cheeks after my foundation and before my powder, I just looked at my face in the mirror and I look soooo fresh and lovely .. flawless actually . I am over 50 so that is a big thing .

I like it bt for a darker skin woman it’s more of a highlighter instead of blush. Still beautiful just not a blush. I thought by the color online it would be a nice orange tone for me bt it’s not.,I was deceived,6 May 2020,Thomjascat,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Hate the price for the amount that’s given which is probably why I would only pick up during a sale.  I do love these blushes. They are easy to use and long wearing. I had no problem with pigmentation on my medium skin tone only one swirl with my brush for each cheek and I was good! However I’m not sure about the lighter shades I can only speak for the deeper shades.,Maybe only buy theses at discount,6 May 2020,ness1000,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I knew what I was getting myself into when I bought this blush being an extremely oily girl. I do love cream products though. I’ve made many in the past work for me. With that being said, this was a no from me. I love that they’re sheer but the pay off was just a big spot of glitter around my cheeks. And yea I have textured skin but I love blush. I didn’t think this was going to be as glittery as it was. The color is beautiful but this is a just a big no from me.",,6 May 2020,bbbbianca,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I picked up the shades Rosé Latte, Cool Berry, & Fuego Flush. I do not recommend Fuego Flush because only glitter shows up. You really have to build it up for the orange flush. I really like the other two shades though, my favorite is Rosé Latte since it is really warm and natural. It looks really dark and intimidating but it isn’t at all. I would recommend using a brush or your fingers if you want more pigment but If you just want a little flush use a sponge. It looks glowy on the cheeks but dries down so there is no tacky or sticky feeling. I would say try this product out!",Rosé Latte=perfection Fuego Flush..not so much,5 May 2020,sar213,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I love these blushes so much that I bought four of them: strawberry drip, petal pout, rose latte, and fuego flush. They last a long time, they blend SO easily, colors are so flattering, i just love them. I find that they work best if you build them up in really light layers instead of plopping a bunch of product on at once. They're definitely sheer, but in the best possible way--so dewy and natural and fresh and just so good. They bring so much life to your face and they don't break me out!! I love these blushes and I'm so happy I bought them.",SO GOOD!! I bought four. the perfect cream blush.,5 May 2020,malalisica,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I ordered Cool Berry as well as Strawberry Drip. I’m really happy with the colors — I tried to pick shades unlike ones I already have in my extensive cream blush collection so that these wouldn’t feel redundant. I think there are definitely some gaps in the color selection but I’m hoping maybe Fenty will come out with more colors. The formula on these is absolutely dreamy. They are very emollient and creamy, easy to pick up from the pan without having to apply too much pressure, and they go on sheer enough and blend well so you can pick your level of pigmentation. I’ve found that they play well with other products I wear regularly, both cream and powder. The color doesn’t disappear on me over time like some cream blushes do and they also aren’t greasy or oily. Overall I’m very happy with them. I know a lot of people are unhappy with the price, but I feel like $20 is pretty fair for a prestige products of this size. The packaging is designed to be compact, which makes the product seem small versus other similar products that are either the same amount of blush or just a little more in bulkier packaging. These are designed compact and slim. If they were $25 I’d feel a little ripped off and if they were $30 I wouldn’t buy at all. But I think these are perfectly priced to be able to collect different colors.",My current favorite cream blushes.,5 May 2020,Oranaiche,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"First time I tried this, I put it on after I had powder bronzer on. Tried using my finger and it wouldn’t blend even with no powder in the area. Tried to use a wet sponge and it was patchy and the cream picked up my powder bronzer. Used a brush and it applied better but still patchy. Second try did with no makeup on, only skincare. Used my finger to apply it and it pilled up on my face and was still a little patchy. Very irritating cream formula.",difficult to work with,5 May 2020,tara12,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Omg love this shade! Was scared to purchase cream blush, usually I use powder because I thought it would look blotchy like some other cream blushes that I’ve tried! Honestly though it looked amazing, application was so easy and gave such a natural glow dewy blush look! I’ll definitely purchase again xx

"I bought the shades strawberry drip and rosé latte. Using either brush or sponge both left a lovely natural flush. I didn’t find them greasy rather at the end of the day I had a healthy look glow. For reference I’m in shade 410/420 in fenty.  However even though I like them I won’t be repurchasing. I’ve had problems with every fenty product other than the lipgloss (which is my favourite). The primer, the foundation, the bronzer and now the blush have broken me out. I have no idea what ingredient is in these products that is breaking out  my skin. I don’t think I can return them so I’ll just use them up. I recommend them if you’re not sensitive and haven’t had issues with the primer or foundation especially.",Great...,5 May 2020,Olicity15,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"While I do really enjoy this formula, I'm sad to report that this shade actually pulls a bit pink on my light olive complexion. I really have to build it up before I start to see that purple tone come through (photo is of the blush built up). It's not a bad blush by any means, it's actually really flattering and still pairs well with purple eye looks. It's just not the purple cream blush of my dreams. Side note, I also have Rose Latte which is utterly perfect in every way. They both wear well too, (6-8 hours depending) on normal / dry combo skin and are fantastic for minimal makeup days.",Great for makeup minimalists.,5 May 2020,ellelafant,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"The issue I have with this is firstly the size— the size is absolutely ridiculous for the price in my opinion. Also, I tried it on without a base and within an hour the product faded and is barely there. I like the finish when you first apply, but other than that I think this product is a total waste. Could’ve formulated it better in terms of being long-wearing at least to justify the size but no. I will be returning this.",NOT WORTH IT,5 May 2020,Rummzy,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Not bad! Super creamy warms up and melts into your skin. Ive only used it on bare skin so far for that flushed look. Its hard to over do it too. I used my finger but I like using a brush. You get better control with a brush. In my opinion it didnt last long, I saw it kind of fade away after a few hours. For the price its worth it but Colourpop blush creams would be a good dupe. I was surprised how small it was, the same size as a small highlighter compact.",,5 May 2020,SaintArtemis,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"Honestly didn’t have a big issue with the size of this product—it is small, but feels like it’ll take a while to get through. My issue is with staying power—I’m wearing without a base, and probably an hour and a half after application the color was completely faded. The color is really pretty however, and maybe you would have more luck using this over foundation!",,5 May 2020,allyrp,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Definitely arrived in smaller packaging than I anticipated, but it works fine since I usually apply cream products with my fingers.  Such a beautiful product, especially if you are fairer.  I have a hard time with blushes looking crazy on me because they are so bright or punchy, but this is a soft and subtle blush that will give you a lit from within glow.",,5 May 2020,sarahemcatee,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"So... I bought Daiquiri Dip, Strawberry Drip, and Petal Poppin, ended up disappointed with all three. This isn't a bad product, not at all, it's just really not for fair skin. I have red hair that leans strawberry blonde and fair-neutral/fair-pink skin. I NEVER ever ever wear blush, because it ends up standing out too much on my cheeks and looks cartoonish. I've probably just never worn shades that were nude enough to look good on me, instead ending up with ones that were way too pink. When these were announced I was excited to try them, because I figured sheered out, they would look okay on me. Nope. These look so vibrant on my cheeks, no sheerness can save it. In order to look passable I basically have to sheer them out so much it literally wipes it all off, even the lightest Petal Poppin shade. Just not for me. They will look great on people whose skin is deeper than me! Also, no amount of photos or youtube videos displaying their small size can prepare you for how tiny IRL they really are..",,5 May 2020,oceanblues,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Can only speak for lighter skin tones but this is a really nice shade. It’s the perfect sunburnt/sun-kissed wash of color. It’s definitely an everyday shade, especially in the summer. It’s way too pigmented at first so I have to really sheer it out. But I’m happy w the end result (see pic) and would recommend to similar skin tones!",perfect sun kissed look,4 May 2020,babygenius,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I am not new to cream products. I buy pretty much every cream blush, bronzer and highlighter that comes out. This particular one is definitely deserving of 5 stars and let me tell you why. I can put this over set foundation with ease, that's no easy feat considering alot of other cream blushes disturb set foundation. This isn't patchy, splotchy or anything. Applies beautifully with a brush in a dabbing motion, i don't drag it over the skin. This is a beautiful product.  I also enjoy the fact that it isn't overly pigmented to where you can loose control over it. It's very buildable and easy to use. i had a problem with the natasha denona bloom palette cream blush shade, it was so pigmented that even for a mua like myself I would easily loose control over it and a tiny amount was almost too much. This on the other hand just starts off really mild and subtle and builds up. I live in hot and humid Florida so I sweat alot and this has held up nicely while outdoors and living my active lifestyle.",Easy to use cream blush,4 May 2020,DressageQueen86,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Most cream blushes come in the standard range of pinks/reds/corals, so I was really intrigued by this entire range. I have all the best, cult-fave cream/stick blushes, and am into a no makeup-makeup look, so this is my first colour product from Fenty. I'm very fair (usually shade 1 or 2 in most foundations) and was worried Rose Latte wouldn't look right on me. It applies sheer, is buildable, and dries down so it acts like a stain, which I love. It has great staying power, and gives me the sunned look I was looking for. I don't know why people are complaining about the size, because this is the perfect size - even if you were to use this on a daily basis, this would last you months.",,4 May 2020,karenleeza,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I found this colour to appear a little darker in person than what’s shown in the online photo. It’s still nice just a little darker than expected. I have warm tan skin and it looks good on my tone.

"Ngl I know the size is pretty bad for the price, however for the product performance it actually makes up for the downside. I think a lot people bought this product without doing research into product claims. If you're looking for BAM PIGMENT and all, this isn't a product for you. It claims to be sheer and indeed it is. Despite it's sheerness though it will deposit color, but in a very natural blushing from within look. For me, on oily skin, this product works and looks wonderful. It blends super easily, glowy and looks natural despite being the deepest shade, and stays on well (esp if set w/ translucent powder). I use a small stipple brush and it barely takes a 1-2 baby taps to deposit a good amount of color. And because it takes so little, I doubt I would pan this product before it goes bad. If you do need more pigment, it builds on itself really well, even with powder on top. I suggest using your fingers in that case. I highly recommend this cream blush if you're willing to look past the size and price, or simply just buy it when the next Sephora sale comes around.",Lovely product despite size,4 May 2020,MissMikki,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I’ve ordered two more colors.",,3 May 2020,KarrahMill,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I’m a VIB Rouge and have actually never written a review here before but decided this needed one. I’m obsessed with these blushes. I’m a big cream blush gal (I love the ones from RMS and Glossier and use them daily). I was so excited for this launch and they didn’t disappoint. I have 3 colors so far and ordered another. Rosé latte is my favorite for my brown skin, it’s super natural for a no makeup day and applies really sheer with a brush but gets great color with my fingers. Crush on Cupid is the perfect cool pink I didn’t have in my collection. I like it for a more blushy look. Daiquiri dip is a bit bold for me, but looks really pretty sheered out and I’m sure I’ll still be wearing it. They all apply beautifully and look like skin without being oily at all. My RMS blushes don’t dry down and move easily so I hesitate to wear them for just around the house, but these are perfect for that. Rosé latte even lasted through a sweaty workout where I was blotting my face (not without transfer but still). Overall love these and definitely think they’re worth $20.",,3 May 2020,mayaphil,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

I apply it with a more dense brush and I find that it has more color payoff that way. This color looks amazing on my fair skin, works great on top of powder, and never leaves me looking greasy throughout the day.

I was extremely disappointed when I tried this out both with a natural face of makeup and full glam. For shade reference I am 290 or 300 in the Fenty Foundation and the color pay off of this blush was terrible. It was super sheer, blotchy and straight glittery. I tried applying this with my fingers, the fenty brush, and a beauty blender but it went left each time. This blush in size was SMALLER than a beauty blender, all of Fenty’s highlighters and bronzers. Overall I felt like I paid premium price for a product that felt like it was from Claires or Icing.

It gives a natural flush, not a harsh, chalky line you get with some powder blushes.  I liked it so much I bought another color to blend with this one.

"Ok, if you have a fair skin tone and are looking for a pretty, natural shade, Rose Latte is the way to go! It may be the deepest shade in the collection, but it is very easy to sheer out with a stipple brush or your fingers and has a lovely terra-cotta Nude undertone! I find this to be super complementary on my skin tone (Fenty 100, Lancome 090N). Redheads especially will get on with this shade! Only con is it is quite small and pretty sheer once blended, so I think deeper skin tones may not get their money’s worth.",,3 May 2020,labelleamazone,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Amazing, the color blended out so quickly with my fingers and lasted at work for a full 8 hour shift under my mask! it looks so natural and effortless and well.. like skin. ive always loved cream products but they're not always easy to use. this one is!",fenty did it again,3 May 2020,dxvilxbby,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I have to admit, I was skeptical about using this blush due to very mixed reviews (mostly due to sheerness and size of the product). However, I wanted to come to my own conclusions and try it out for myself and I was pleasantly surprised by this product! I have combo skin that can be super fickle with products, and I was definitely worried about trying a cream blush because I was afraid it would look like slapped-on grease. That was not the case; it had a gorgeous natural finish and it was literally idiot-proof to apply. Lots of people give this product bad reviews because of it being sheer, which I think is kind of nonsense considering it’s described that way in the actual product description. It was made to be build up in the first place. It wore beautifully and never faded. Yes, the size could potentially be better, but realistically I could see myself getting use out of it for a while. Also, it’s a great size to travel with. It my personal case, the pros outweighed the cons with this product.",Pleasantly Surprised!,3 May 2020,AleniRhea,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
These are everything I’ve been waiting for!!! I love how they just melt into the skin so perfectly. I even put them to the test and set my whole face and applied product afterwards and it didn’t pick up my makeup AT ALL!!! I feel like a lot of the negative reviews are user errors...if you don’t know how to use creams then please learn how to use these properly they are a must have. This is Coming from someone who usually uses powder products I am in love.,MUST HAVE!!!,3 May 2020,Lexilexb,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Very sheer,  you must be pale, fair skin tone to wear this shade. I am a warm light- med skin tone. Gave it to my niece who is much lighter in skin tone.  Great formula, will  purchase a darker shade.",Very sheer-light skin tones,2 May 2020,Sharon17,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I like the formula. It grips nicely. I feel like the product is very small and I do not see much of a difference from my cheaper sephora cream blush. It does sort of fade.,,2 May 2020,itskd,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I was a bit nervous choosing Summertime Wine because it was called a shimmer shade, but I needn’t have worried. The shimmer is barely noticeable and the shade looks exactly like my own color when I blush or pinch my checks. This cream blush blends beautifully and can be layered to achieve the desired intensity. But it can also be applied in a sheer layer for a very natural looking blush. Love it!","Gorgeous, natural cheek color",2 May 2020,jewelrydesigner,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I LOVE!!! I have multiple colors (Fuego flush, daquiri dip, strawberry dip & cool berry) so far my favorite is strawberry dip because I love pinky shade but this was a nice way to step out my comfort zone & use other colors. I also ordered petal Poppin & summertime wine. I figured since I live the formula & performance of the others these colors will do great since they're my fave type of shades. I wouldn't say I have a least favorite but I get less use out of daquiri dip because I don't formulate makeup looks that match the blush without my face being too red but I think it's a beautiful shade & definitely going to try more neutral looks with that color. I finally received my brush & I prefer the brush over my finger just so I don't have to keep wiping my fingers off. if I want good color pay off I'll use my brush & if I went a bit over board I'll use my finger to blend. I don't see others problem with the blush maybe its their skin type or skin tone but the pay off should be there because it's definitely buildable & if you got 1 blush & that color didn't work for you doesn't mean the formula or product isnt good, that just isn't your color. Fuego flush is the sheerest on me but I don't like that because I would only use that color without foundation all the others I believe will work w/ or w/o  perfectly. I definitely recommend me being new to cream products has got me wanting to try more as I also got their bronzer in teddy & love it & thinking to get chocolate as a cream contour.",READ THIS IS YOU'RE DEBATING BUYING THIS PRODUCT,2 May 2020,Liyahbugg,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This was a color that I was afraid of but it actually is perfect! This product went on smoothly and sheer so a little does a lot. This color went on my skin and gave me just the right amount of color with a beautiful glow. To my delighted surprise, this cream blush stayed all day, didn’t separate or fade away, and didn’t sit on top of my skin and show off my pores.

"I love this product! It’s super easy to apply. I literally applied it as a child would. Just no precision and it melted into my skin perfectly! You can definitely layer it on and it becomes bright or just tap a bit for a natural flush. I wore it over foundation and power and it is not move makeup around. I don’t know who it did that but it did! I was outside for a good 4 hours and it did not melt, move, nothing weird happened. I love this! I got this pink one and the purple!",beautiful baby doll pink,2 May 2020,tangerine11,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
This formula is fantastic. I am a cream blush lover and this may have just taken the lead as my favorite formula. It has that sheer/translucent finish that looks like skin. Almost like a stain but easier to work with. These blend beautiful and are pretty hard to mess up I'd imagine. I don't find the size too small and I think it will be pretty convenient for travel.,The perfect cream blush,2 May 2020,nikkidip91,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Honestly one of the best cream blushes I’ve tried, sheer but builds. Works best on a “no makeup makeup look”. I recommend patting this product into the skin to give a beautiful sheer but impactful look. Also pat it over a translucent powder to add color depth. Not for someone looking for a full glam look or someone who uses heavy powders. Simplicity is best with these blushes",New Favorite from a powder blush fan,2 May 2020,BeautyLoverRach,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I’ve been wearing Nars Exhibit A blush for years. I’ve always wanted them to make that blush into a liquid or cream formula but they haven’t! I got Daiquiri Dip (bright red) it is literally a dream dupe for that. It is super pigmented so be careful. I lightly put powder on top to make it last a little long. Btw do not put creams on top of powder others wise it won’t work properly.,bright red blush that’s cream,1 May 2020,CoriGraham,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

It looks soooo natural! I love how light it feels on the skin. Def expected a little more shimmer like a highlight but in the light you see the blend of colors which is nice that it looks like a natural glow.,,1 May 2020,Ai4Ni3,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This blush blends out really nice. I have fair skin and the cool berry looks nice. I apply my foundation then put this blush on my cheeks, then set my face with a powder. It is very pigmented.

"I bought this to wear as a cream eyeshadow. I have small, hooded eyes that respond very well to proper contouring, but I started to feel like my powder shadows were just too heavy for daytime...even my most natural shades applied as lightly as possible. I wanted to see if I could create the same effect in a sheer finish with a liquid or cream. Before I bought anything, I tried using my Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Contour. It was pretty, but blending the liquid with enough precision took way too long. Onto a cream product. I was looking for a more purple-mauve, bruise-like shade - not quite Rosé Latte - but the reviews were good and it’s matte, so I went for it. I’m really glad I did. As many have mentioned, the pan is small...much more the size you’d imagine for an eye product than one for cheeks. The color also looks more burnt/brown in-person than it does online. But once I put it on, the slight pink/purple undertone came out and it was beautiful. It blended out very easily into the shape I wanted on my eye and was unexpectedly pretty on my lips and cheeks, too...since I’m fair I figured it would be too dark as a blush/lip color. If it works on me it should work on anyone!",great multi product,1 May 2020,colenativity,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"After reading the reviews I was curious to see how I would like this blush.

I have fair/light skin and purchased strawberry drip. For me it was extremely pigmented and blended out nicely. I don’t wear foundation so I can’t say how it works on top of foundation.

I’m ok with the pan size because I hate not being able to get through products and I feel like maybe I’ll get through this, however it’s gonna take awhile because it’s so pigmented on me! Just a dab of this bright color is gorgeous. Satin finish. No bad reaction! I almost wish it was more sheer but I’m glad it’s not so that it can work on more skin tones! Really love the springtime/summer vibe of this color!",Strawberry Drip <3,1 May 2020,SarahS88,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I love these blushes! I have used Petal Poppin and Strawberry Drip...they are both gorgeous shades! I have extremely fair skin but I also use fake tan so I love that these are buildable. I have used them both on natural skin and when I am tanned. They are so versatile because of the ability to build them up and get the vibrancy you want! I know a lot of people are concerned about the size however being a cream product they expire faster than a powder and you don’t need to use a lot to get a good color pay off. I think they are the perfect size! Can’t wait to try more colors.,Love!,1 May 2020,mbe10,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Do not waste your money. it's not very good at all. it doesn't work well on top of powder and it doesn't seem very creamy either. i would say this product would work best for someone who doesn't wear foundation or powder as a v,SAVE YOUR COINS,1 May 2020,MSSTONE,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Love this product! This shade does have some visible shimmer in it that looks a bit glittery on the face, but only from super close. Gorgeous formula that is buildable but still pigmented and carries a punch. This is the perfect orange blush! Compact size makes it easy to throw in your bag and retouch if you need to (I find I always want more blush after a workday and before dinner/drinks). 

Blended beautifully into the skin over my base products. 

Only giving 4 stars because it’s a bit pricy for 3 grams of product. I’m going to be buying more shades, anyways. Haha",great shimmery cream blush!,1 May 2020,bananashack,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I’ve never tried cream blush before and I wanted to give it a go and caved. And oh my gosh. No regrets! I absolutely love this. Even if you accidentally put too much, just try blending a little more with a sponge. This has been my new go to for light makeup.","Amazing, a little goes a long way!",1 May 2020,MsKat23,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I, like so many others, saw the size of this blush and rolled my eyes. But this blush packs a pigment. I dipped my brush in and got enough color payoff for both cheeks without even marring the surface of this blush.  I think people will get a lot of use out of this product.  I am usually a light peach/petal poppin color of blush person so I decided to try this brighter color for a flushed look when I have a tan (i'm 190-200 in pro filter). I tried it on today when i got it and it's so nice and natural on! I'm pretty sure I could build it up substantially when I have a bit more color. either way I might get another one because these are so easy to use. A+ Riri",I was skeptical,1 May 2020,Emgmusic,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I like these, they’re cute. I just wish they were the same size as the cream bronzer. These are so small. But if you can look past the size, these are great. They blend really well",small,1 May 2020,alexajadexoxo,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"The cream blush isn't too sheer or too bold. It's a perfect medium application. I blotted it with tissue a bit, so it wouldn't be too obvious. I use the new Face Shaping Brush for this and I earn you, since this is a cream, if you rub it in and blend it too much, it will wipe off some foundation! When I noticed that my brush was turning brown, I stopped. So if you only want a tiny bit of blush on your cheeks, don't use a lot!

Also, the size of the blush is very small! Think of it as the size of a newborn turtle or a mini cookie.","Strawberry Drip is really pretty, but smears.",1 May 2020,rosegoldlovely,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Ideal cream blush. A sheer wash of color that is very buildable, they have a dewy finish. Applies well with a brush or a damp beauty sponge",Ideal cream blush,30 Apr 2020,missrebecca,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"When I first got the product, I was surprised by how tiny it was, especially in comparison to the cream bronzer. As it turns out, you need very little of the product to give you a perfect, natural flush. I can lightly tap my finger in the pan once for each cheek (and I like a good amount of blush). I was nervous that Petal Poppin would be too light for my medium skin, but it’s perfect for an everyday, no makeup makeup look. It gives me a beautiful pink glow - my husband even commented on how fresh and bright my face looked!

"Gotta say, a lil disappointed. Fenty beauty is honestly one of my fav brands, however this was kinda meh. First off, it’s soo much smaller than I thought, looks like a mini product and I wasn’t super happy abt the color. The bright red does eventually blend out quite nicely however at first it almost looks like a crayola crayon red. Overall not my favorite but not bad either",,30 Apr 2020,emmi06,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I was super disappointed in this product, given that I’ve enjoyed majority of Fenty’s launches. Firstly to address the size: it is small. It is barely bigger than a single eyeshadow pan. It isn’t a good value for your dollar. Secondly, the pigment and colour payoff is absolutely terrible. For reference my skin tone is a Fenty 370. I’m pretty tanned with a yellow undertone, I have no problems with colours showing up on my skin. I got Fuego Flush and I hate it. Its very sheer and applies patchy due to the glitter in it. I tried it with my fingers, brush, and beautyblender and they all had the same result. It just makes my face look flat and muddy. In short, this is definitely the worst Fenty product launch to date & I will be returning it.",This was a huge miss from Fenty—Skip it!,30 Apr 2020,mangekyo,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I honestly was surprised at how tiny this is. I was thinking it would be the same size as her highlighters but this is smaller than the palm of my hands! Taking one star off for that because for the price, there isn't a lot of product as compared to other cream blushes, like for example, Milk, and their minis. Other than that, I love this cream blush. I always used powder blushes and never a cream one, but I'm glad I picked this up! I used my fingers at first, which definitely does work nicely. I was afraid it might go on like a finger print on top of my highlighter ans foundation, but it was very easy to blend out. However, I went for a blush brush instead, and just dipped it in there and applied it instead. It went on faster and applied in the motion that I liked better, in my opinion. I love how I can build it up, or keep it subtle. Crush on Cupid is a really cute, pink colour for that flushed look.",TINY...but creamy and works!,30 Apr 2020,Meliths,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I can only speak for the shade Fuego Flush. If your skin is medium or deeper, this does not show up well. You have to layer and layer and then there’s just way too much product on your face. It’s also way too glittery. When I try to set the blush in place with a powder blush, that’s when it gets especially bad. I have used it over foundation and on bare skin but I always have the same issues. Might be fine if you are fair or light.",,30 Apr 2020,GryffindorGirl,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I actually really like this blush, despite the small size. If anyone has purchased the bomb baby set with the mini highlighter and gloss, this is pretty much the same size as the mini highlighter compact that comes in that. So, yes, quite small. That said, the amount of product isn’t actually as terrible as it seems and a little really goes a longggg way - at least with Cool Berry. It’s super creamy and pigmented and blends out nicely into a colorful flush that actually looks really natural and flattering. I think I’m going to order at least one other color. I have my eye on Bikini Martini and Daquiri Drip. Cool Berry is pretty much exactly how it sounds, a nice mauvey shade with a bit of shimmer. I think it would flatter a wide range of skin tones. I wish this was priced a tad lower (even $18 for this size would seem more reasonable), but the product is good quality and fun to use. Definitely worth it while the insider sale is happening.",,30 Apr 2020,emdc1023,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

This is a really pretty and natural product with a dewy finish. The colors are really forgiving too so it’s hard to overdue it. I have a medium olive skin tone and I found a few shades that were really a nice match. One thing is I found them a little sticky which made them somewhat hard to blend out with my fingers but still doable.,Pretty and natural,30 Apr 2020,KAC112,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Pretty in the pan, awful on face. Fenty said that their cream blushes were meant for any skin tone, definitely not for fair skin tones. It as not blendable at all and looked like a streak of orange glitter. This is my second time purchasing Fenty products and still disappointed the second time. Wish I could love it but definitely a pass, save your money. It also is very tiny and not worth the twenty dollars.","Not worth it, wish I could get a refund",30 Apr 2020,Mdana453,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
If your thinking about it just get it; it’s so creamy and blend-able. You can built the color so easily. It’s soo beautiful I’m happy I chose this color I’m more of a light medium skin tone makeup forever Mayte and velvet shade Y255 and maybelline Matte and porless 128. And I do have oily skin and works perfect. Wound be able to really test it in the heat until all this quarantine is over but so far in the house it’s great. Oh and I do set it with lose powder.,"Just get it, it’s a must have",30 Apr 2020,Nannajazzy,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"You can blend these with your eyes closed. The texture is amazing. I've applied it both on unset foundation and foundation set with powder. It doesn't disturb the makeup under it, which is amazing. The colors are g o r g e o u s. I got fuego flush (which is shockingly flattering) and petal poppin. The first time I tried these, I got on my phone and ordered rosé latte and cool berry before I even finished my makeup because of how bomb they are. I'll probably end up getting even more colors because, trust me, four isn't even enough.

Yeah, the component makes it look kind of small, but you honestly don't get that much less product compared to other creams when you actually start looking at the product amount and price breakdowns. I really think people need to chill about complaining about the size. Plus, it's high end, quality makeup. $20 is not ridiculous. That's barely more than some drugstore prices. I'd pay $30 or more for this product without blinking because it's that good. 

The product is on the sheer side, which is clearly stated. However, it's absolutely buildable. You can look like you're barely kissed with color and it's just illuminating from within you, or you can build it up to a blush ~moment~. 

It's such a beautiful, just-juicy-dewy-enough look that's not sticky or too emollient. Just get it already!",Will repurchase forever,30 Apr 2020,BreannaR,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I am a sucker for Fenty Beauty, and even though I don't typically dabble in cream blushes, I had to give these a try. Packaging- she nailed it. These are compact and just so so cute.

"Love, love this new cream blush in rosé latte, it's so natural, I've always worn powder blush and I was scared to try it out but it's so user friendly. I love that you can build up the color to the intensity that you prefer and it doesn't irritate my skin at all as I do have very sensitive skin. I don't mind the small packaging and the price is right for me, cream products expire faster and I don't want to be wasteful. And if you compare it to high end where the products come in small quantities and you pay skyrocketing prices, then this is way better. Also everyone is complaining about how small it is but the popular Buxom wanderlust blush is 3.5 g and costs $29.50 CAD, and no one was complaining about that.

Beautiful and unique shade which gets it points. The pigmentation is good and buildable. 2 stars off for size which others have previously mentioned. I like the brand but for the price point the blush should offer more product. When I first got into higher end makeup NARS blushes were $25.

I cannot believe everyone throwing a fit about the size. Like, yeah, they are small but they are $20. Minis from other brands can be $20 to $25.

"The formula on this is amazing!! So creamy, smooth, and very easy to blend out (nice thing is that it doesn't blend away into nothing). The shade is a bit on the sheer side and it has tiny bits of  shimmer that look almost like a highlighter on the skin, but when built up you can see the colour. It's such a gorgeous orange-y peach colour and extremely flattering on tan skin tones. Don't let the vibrancy intimidate you because you can easily sheer it out or build it up to full opacity. It also does not feel sticky to the touch. I like to apply with with my fingers and occasionally I'll set it with a similar powder blush for more colour pay off.

"This tiny $20 blush will last you THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I literally tap my ring finger twice to pick up color and that's more than enough for one cheek. Summertime Wine is EXTREMELY pigmented!! (but I can't speak for the other colors). It lasts all day on me - I saw someone else mention glossier cloud paint lasting longer. I have every shade of cloud paint and I love it, but the color typically does not last all day especially if I'm touching my face or leaning my cheek on my hand, which I tend to do A LOT. But summertime wine lasts through hours of work and touching my face. It's a lovely shade, and I don't have anything quite like it! Overall, extremely happy with my purchase and I'm eyeing rose latte next (looks similar to glossier's dusk cloud paint which I LOVE but am almost out of!)","Summertime Wine, only shade you need this season",29 Apr 2020,jbe2013,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I was nervous about purchasing this blush after reading all of the negative reviews, but I'm glad I did! Yes, it is tiny, but as some mentioned, I'm okay with that since it is a cream blush, and I'm not likely to use a giant pan up before it expires (plus I'm likely going to be trying some other new product by then!). It IS pigmented, and the texture is creamy and emollient, without it feeling sticky. It's great for creating a skin-like finish and looks good for summer. I took a star off because it was not as long-lasting as the Glossier cloud paints, but longer than the old Yves Saint Laurent Babydoll lips and cheeks formula. I find I get more pigmentation by applying it with my fingers and blending out and a much softer look when using a brush.",Great for the natural look!,29 Apr 2020,bunnyhole,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Okay these are absolutely gorgeous. They are super creamy and blend into the skin so beautifully, providing a pretty flush to the skin.

"Very pigmented! I also like the formula. I’m returning because it’s too pigmented/too intense for me. If you find the color(s) you like, I’d still recommend.

The blush is so creamy and buildable. I applied with my fingers and it was such a beautiful flush of color! I worked out with this on my fave I swear and it didn’t budge!!! I put lip balm over it on my lips and it didn’t come off at all!! Loved these so much I bought two more colors and I can’t wait to use them!

I really didn't think the glitter in this would show up that much but it really does. But the most disappointing thing about this product is the lack of pigment it barely shows up on my skin and I am not that dark-i have to layer this up for it to show up and the more i layer the more glittery it gets. I was so excited for this but really disappointed.,Not pigmented enough for medium skin tones,28 Apr 2020,erikamelesia94,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Really love this shade! As a WOC and makeup junkie I do not own a purple blush . I wear 390 or 420 in Fenty depending on time of the year. It’s not as vivid as you would think in the pan. Buildable. Gives a really pretty vibrant flush . I was worried about purple making my cheeks looked bruised but it’s pretty nice. It’s my 3rd day wearing the color. I like tapping it on with my fingers and then blend it out with a brush.,Great for dark skin,28 Apr 2020,reynoldsmv,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I had my eye on these blushes since they were first announced and now that I have had a chance to play with them, I can safely say I am obsessed. I admit I was a bit intimidated since the colors looked like they would be super bold when first applied. Not these whatsoever. These are so easy to work with and is impossible to apply too much. When they say these are buildable and sheer creams, they truly are. The pans are bright and bold colors but when you blend them out, they are just beautiful and flattering, starting with a gorgeous wash of color that can be built up. I was so impressed with how easy these blushes are to blend out. I applied an even layer to each cheek and took a look after every application. One application adds a light wash of color but still is super sheer, so application is absolutely foolproof. I love how lightweight these creams are and they truly are ""light as air"". They settle to a smooth finish that isn't oily or greasy. It almost reminds me of a cheek stain a bit, but all colors remove easily when you go to remove your makeup. Since Fenty's ""Freestyle"" products can be used in multiple ways, whether it is on the cheeks, eyes, lips, body, etc., I tried it on my lips and eyes as well to create a monochromatic look. I just found my new favorite ""natural"" makeup look for most days I want a simple, natural look and the best part about it? I can add or downplay intensity depending on my mood. Some days I might just want a barely there wash of color on my cheeks and my eyes to pop or vice versa. I can mix and match the shades or just keep them monochrome. The possibilities are positively endless with these. They may be smaller than anticipated, but a little goes a super long way and they are the perfect size to take with you. These creamy pans of sheer color have a new permanent place in my routine and were absolutely worth the wait.",New Favorite I Cannot Live Without,28 Apr 2020,Merryyyyy,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"Yeah it's small but it is SUPER pigmented so I have no idea when I'll actually finish this. So can we get over this now? Ok cool. Now that that's over, it is pigmented and blends so nicely into your skin that it just looks natural. You just woke up with this beautiful flush color on your face.

At first I was disappointed in the size of the product when I received my Sephora order, but upon application, it is clear that a little goes a long way (meaning even this smaller amount will last you a while).

I will that price tag hurts especially considering the price.

"First of all, its such a shame this blush has so many negative reviews just because of the size. You need such a tiny amount of product, this should last you a LONG time. Second, the formula is stunning. Its sheer but buildable, natural, luminous, long lasting, and best of all, it dries down completely so if you love the look of cream products but hate that tacky feeling- this is for you.

I love this product it’s so natural and easy to blend and apply. The only problem is the size.

I bought 4 shades and they are not very pigmented so i feel like i am going to run through these within weeks. However they are extremely skin like and very natural looking! you can build up for more coverage if that is your desired look but you might run through the product a lot faster.",eh,27 Apr 2020,bishen,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I have to say the texture and application of this blush is beautiful and easy. It's smooth, easy to blend with fingers or a brush and definitely creamy! This shade ""Fuego flush"" however is very very subtle and sheer but the pigment of this on the skin does not match the pan.  I am a brown girl with medium-tan skin and I can build this up with a stipple blush but only to get a very very subtle effect. More of a glow and very light flush.  I would almost use this more as a blush topper or highlight. Because i am warm toned - it just enhances my skin but doesn't provide any additional colour.  I do want to order another shade in more of a pinky/berry tone so that I can use this as effectively as a cream blush.  I know they are small but the size doesn't bother me...really - how much cream blush will you actually use up before the product expires? So 3 stars mainly because of the shade....but would give it 4-5 stars for consistency and feel of the product.",Love the feel but wrong shade for brown skin!,27 Apr 2020,sv222,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"As someone who wears only cream blushes, I was very excited to see Fenty release their own version. Drama Cla$$ is a unique shade to my collection - on my light olive skin, it looks like a berry/violet pink. This should go wonderfully with my lip colors in that family.

The texture is smooth, although not as creamy or dewy a finish as I prefer. The pigmentation level is slightly sheer, but can be layered without pilling or getting streaky. I'd say the Fenty blushes have a decent level of pigmentation: more than Colourpop Blush Stix, less than Stila Convertible Color or Bobbi Brown pot rouge. It's comparable to the Nudestix Nudies Bloom blushes, with a more matte texture. Both Stila and Bobbi Brown are also more creamy.

For those concerned about the product weight: the amount for the price is comparable to or better than other mid-range blushes (such as Stila or Bobbi Brown). It also offers a good color range for all complexions. Bobbi Brown pot rouge was my favorite, but unfortunately they've discontinued several colors, including shades for deep skin tones.

I'd recommend this product, particularly for its color range. However, I don't think it will become one of my cream blush favorites.","Drama Cla$$, shade 07",27 Apr 2020,brazzer,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I was a little surprised by how tiny the cream blush was in comparison to the cream bronzers that launched with this product. I was hoping they would be the same size.

"This is so pretty!!! The cream isn’t greasy or tacky feeling. It lays on the skin beautifully. I noticed a lot of people calling the component small, but if you compare to buxom blush, they are around the same size and since it’s a cream product, you won’t be needing to use as much as a powder blush which I think most people don’t realize.

I do recommend",Pretty and dewy,26 Apr 2020,RoyalButterfly,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
This is a beautiful product - but too small for the price. You get about half the amount of product as you would with almost any other cream blush sold at Sephora. I’m not sure why the decision was made to make these smaller than the cream bronzers that just launched but it would have been nice if they came in the same size.

I bought the shade Rosé Latte and Summer Wine. They are really pretty shades that I applied with my fingertips. It blends very easily. Like others have mentioned it is very small. It is smaller than the palm of my hand and I’m petite in height. The pan seems pretty shallow as well so not sure how long it will last. If you want to use daily I think 1-2 months max? Still gorgeous colours. The size for the price is a negative.,Pretty but small,26 Apr 2020,RiRi0901,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"First off, for all the complaints being made about the size, do y’all really think you’re going to go through a cream blush in 6 months anyway? I do agree it is on the smaller side compared to the other blushes I own which range from 3.5-5g but it’s really not that big of a deal for me since I doubt I’ll be able to finish this. The product itself is actually pretty decent in my opinion. Not exactly life changing but it is user friendly since it goes on fairly sheer and can be built up for more colour intensity. I applied it with my fingers and found it extremely easy to blend out and control the amount of product being applied. The blush does set, not exactly to a matte finish or anything but I definitely didn’t experience any tacky ness that some other reviews mentioned. This shade is also very flattering on me since it’s pretty similar to how I naturally flush. Overall I don’t think you NEED this but it’s a nice addition to my collection especially since it’s in a shade I didn’t own prior to this.",Pretty Decent,26 Apr 2020,Jesssily,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"Yes, it's tiny.  Yes, it's sheer.  But, after being lukewarm on it and now paring down on my makeup routine, this is probably one of the best items I could have at this time.  I prefer powder blushes, but this creamy blush really gives you a healthy glow right on application.  The same I try to achieve with powdered blushes, but without the added step of tamping down the blush with a finishing powder or a sponge.  I think what sold me was the video on the page, that lovely fresh face look which is so easy to achieve with this blush.  After wearing for just a couple of days, I decided to grab a second one during this sale.  The tiny-size did have me raise an eyebrow, but I can live with it as I likely will still use other blushes from time to time.

The minus one star is the shade range.  I was hoping for more variance, pinks and berries are flattering for most shades, but the lack of variety left me wanting more.  I hope they'll release more shades in the future.",Mon petit amour,25 Apr 2020,danielledanielle,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

It works under or over powder and does not disturb your foundation. It lasts all day even through hot flashes!  I loved it so much I went back and bought daiquiri dip. Can’t wait to try that color!  Cool berry is perfect for medium/tan skin.  It says it is shimmer but it is very slight.   The texture is very similar to honest beauty.   I don’t feel the need to build it for a natural look. If I want it bolder it takes about 2 passes.  It blends beautifully and melts into the skin. Extremely happy with my purchase and can’t wait for my next blush to be delivered!!,beautiful,25 Apr 2020,amnn1970,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"I have been looking for a light peach blush and this color is perfect (I have light-medium skin with yellow undertones), plus the consistency is amazing and easy to apply. However, this particular shade happens to have flecks of gold glitter in it, which is not something I want; I'm afraid it will look like my highlight has bled down my cheek.

"I love cream brushes. I know the size isnt great but I'm loving these blushes. I use them with a normal blush brush and stipple it on first and keep pouncing till I'm happy. they're very easy to use. I find the colour pay off is great. if they were too pigmented I'd look like a clown. I'm loving these and I've already ordered more. the only colour I'd stay away from is fuego. I watched a ton of videos on this launch, and whether it's a dark skin tone or light. it looked more like a highlight then a tangerine blush.",,25 Apr 2020,Rebecca87Lynn,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I purchased the shade petal poppin as well as rosé latte and am highly pleased with the colours and performance. I am shade 130 in the fenty foundation. The former is a natural neutral pink while the latter is more of a blush bronzer hybrid colour. I apply them with a foundation brush in a stippling motion and found them to easily buildable without lifting my base layers. They blended well and had a natural finish (I would say they do set but it's NOT to the point of a powder or completely matte finish. I think all the pink/red shades would blend out similarly so id advise choosing dramatically different ones if you want multiple or just choosing one with your preferred tone.,,24 Apr 2020,Shurnel,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"This shade is amazing. It’s that neutral nude blush that looks great on everyone. It does need to be built up a bit, but it lasted all day on my skin, even though a workout. I took off one star because the size is small, but I got it during the Sephora sale, so I feel like $16 for this is fair. I just wouldn’t necessarily pay full price. As soon as I tried this, I went back and grabbed Fuego Flush.",Small but mighty,24 Apr 2020,KPotsAndPans,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This ended up being a little deeper than I thought it would be, but I love it. I donr agree with a lot of the negative reviews of this product. I don’t find it to be as sheer as other reviewers, and if you don’t want your blush to be somewhat tacky or creamy, then why are you buying a cream blush...? Will definitely be purchasing other colors",,24 Apr 2020,jkus,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
The product is good but it’s so small. Like this is like beauty on the fly small if not smaller. I’m keeping it because I bought it during the sale but I wouldn’t pay full price for it. Size difference between blush and an iPhone 8 Plus.,so small,24 Apr 2020,yecieboo,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I love the color and love the product. I was shocked when I opened the package though. I thought Sephora had accidentally sent me a deluxe sample. I had to come look at the description and also read reviews to see that the product is just this small. Blush is my go-to, everyday product so I buy a lot of it. There are so many good blushes on the market around the same price that have way more product. I’m actually kind of sad because as I stated, I love the product and wanted to get several more shades. I just don’t feel like it’s worth the money. I still love Fenty as a brand though.",Beautiful Product But Not Worth The Price,24 Apr 2020,SamieLaura,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Omg I can’t say enough about how beautiful this blush is!! I had to buy another shade!! Yeah it’s a small compact but dear jeebus it applies flawlessly and looks like skin!! I applied at 7 am and it is still going starting at 5 pm so it does have lasting power. It can be sheer if you want but I applied with my Tati blendiful and wowzers it applied the perfect amount.,Don’t listen to the naysayers lol,24 Apr 2020,DACHOSEN1,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

Still gets 5 stars because I do really love this blush!",Love it!,24 Apr 2020,stephily,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I'm enjoying this blush! I have classic combination skin (oily T-zone, dry cheeks) and this works nicely for me in both my dry and oily areas. The color is a little intimidating when first opened, but it sheers out beautifully and has a very soft and blendable texture (I used my fingers, but a stippling brush or sponge would also work.)  Interestingly this has a slight ""dry down"", and does not stay sticky or creamy on the cheeks, and instead just feels like bare skin. This has pretty decent lasting power, but less than a typical powder blush that has been set with spray. I'm a little disappointed that this isn't a great multitasking product, though; I tried using this on my lips, and while the color is very pretty, I found it very drying and gritty within a couple hours, even with a balm layered on top. However, it does work as a light eyeshadow. I wish the pan was a little bigger, but considering how much is used at a time, bigger might be wasteful, especially since it isn't great for lips.  I'm considering getting another color, and overall I would say this is worth a try.  I do hope they come out with cream highlighter in a similar pan packaging!",Beautiful color and finish for cheeks,24 Apr 2020,Yoyochanny,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I am so excited. These gave me the no- make-up vibe I was going for. Naturally O.O.T.O., my skin is tan, smooth, naturally glowy, and yes, this is my real flush. This is my natural lip color, twice bitten. Naturally, my skin imperfections peek through as they would after a run or freshed faced from a soothing steamy shower.
I compared to one pan of the Natasha Bloom pallette and figured it was roughly 3 grams to her 3.25 and at $6.66.00 per gram for Fenty that's roughly less than half the price for ND so no shade on the size.
This product created a juicy dewy satin smooth finish that is pretty, youthful, and moist all at once.",No Make-up look!,24 Apr 2020,sundial,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"At first glance, I was very excited about the color range of this product. I purchased shades ""drama class"" and ""rosé latte."" They are definitely sheer, as they are advertised, but are buildable to an extent. If you want a super bold blush then you would have to use a powder over these and they would make a great base. I think they look very pretty on the skin and give a beautiful natural look. I have to note that when they first came in the mail, I was very taken back by their size. I expected them to be the size of the bronzers and killawat highlighters (an assumption due to the same shape/compact) but they are very small. So just know the component is quite small but the product should go a long way still. I was disappointed in size at first but I love fenty products so I am happy with my purchase.","Sheer Color, Pretty Blushes, Small compact",24 Apr 2020,stayrad,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

"This is my first Fenty purchase and I'm a fan. I'm lucky to have a lot of ""good skin"" days so my every day face is a Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and either Glossier's Cloud Paint or NARS blush stick. I love the consistency of Cheeks Out - it's like a tinted lip balm. It looks very pigmented in the container, but it spreads sheer and evenly on the skin. I've used both finger tips and a blush brush and both work perfectly - though I prefer a brush for even application. I really like the sheer finish with just one layer, but because the package is small, I think I'll have to repurchase sooner than for example my Cloud Paint that has a similar price point. It will be a stable product this summer - easy to reapply for a quick, natural, fresh look. Picture is attached - I'm wearing a concealer and Unseen Sunscreen.","AMAZING, but size matters",24 Apr 2020,turtlepowah,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I purchased Rosé Latte, and I just love it! Definitely ordering one of the brighter colors now. I applied it with a brush, and ir just blended so effortlessly! Is really creamy, but not sticky. I have oily skin so I was a little scared it would make look too shiny, so I  lightly set my whole face after with loose powder. I was so amazed how you could still see the blush through, it didn’t affect the color. It was quite long lasting on me. I couldn’t stopped looking at my cheeks, it looks so pretty on! I also purchased a cream bronzer, in the shade Teddy. Both products work so great together!!",She does it again!!,24 Apr 2020,BoszDiva,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

Cute packaging, easy to apply and great color but no lasting power for me (I have combo skin) I also ordered Fuego Flush -both of these will be returned !

I'll add another review for the other colors I bought(Fuego flush, petal Poppin, daiquiri dip & rose latte). I am very pleased with this product I don't have the correct brushes for a cream product so I had to use my fingers & it worked really well the color pay off was amazing for me because it does go on sheer but it's definitely buildable. I keep seeing ppl mad about the size & honestly this is where common sense comes in because it says 3grams of product. I  personally like the size. I have very oily skin & wore it today with no other make up besides eyeshadow, I even took a nap & it's still there & didn't wear off or transfer.

"I really love this cream blush. It gives a beautiful stain to the cheeks. For the people complaining about size this is .1 ozs and NARS, which is $10 more is only .15 ozs sooo Fenty is not too far off in price point for product amount. You’re all just being thrown off by the size of the container. Lilah Bs cream blushes which have over a 4 star rating are $26 and only contain .8 ozs of product. READ THE PRODUCT AMOUNT! Don’t let a container size fool you. Also, like someone else said, cream products will expire much faster then powders and I highly doubt most people will get through this entire blush before the expiration date unless this is the only blush they own and/or use.

"Very beautiful shade with a little gold shimmer . Love the formula and will last awhile considering you don’t need a lot. Not upset at the size considering most blushes are pretty small . It’s sheer and you can build it up. This blush is supposed to be natural looking so I’m not sure why people are mad it it comes off kinda sheer.

"This honestly might be on me for not being about to visualize the product amount but I ordered 2 of these bad boys online and they are So Small. Literally a third of the palm of my hand. I’m really bummed cause they’re so pretty but the actual product is minuscule. Maybe if these were marketed as a mini blush I’d feel different- but because the packaging was the same as their highlighters/ bronzers/ etc. I was definitely expecting a full size product! (Again, you can fully visualize the size from the information listed pls disregard) They can’t even fit the normal fenty clasp on the product so you have to dig your nail into a tiny gap to pry the product open, instead of that smooth open n close on the highlighters. Maybe not a real bummer for most folks but if you have long nails/ super short nails/ weak nails this opening system will bum you out.
On a technical note, the colors are cute enough? Personally, I think you can get the same variety/ effect w lipsticks or even cream shadows and those have more pigment. Only bought these cause I thought they’d be full size and give me room for a larger brush. Spoiler alert: they don’t.

"When I first got this I gawked at it because it's so tiny! But that's perfect because you get a good sized pan and cream products don't have the same shelf life powder products do. This blush is sheer so if you want more pigment the trick is to tap it on to your cheeks and then use a blush brush to tap the product out - blending will only make it vanish into nonexistence. Another thing to know is that this blush does not dry down at all and can transfer easily, especially if you don't set the top of it with a translucent setting powder, so watch out if you're a fan of touching your face or wearing makeup under your mask. Otherwise, it's a lovely,  soft tangerine color as described and is buildable without becoming streaky or pilling up. I have oily skin and had no issues with longevity.",Solid Cream Blush,23 Apr 2020,JazzySierra,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Beautiful and buildable formula! I bought this,as well as the bronzer in the same order, and I won’t lie when I pulled them out of the shipping box the blush looked like a lil baby compared to the bronzer, which is the same size as her powder ones. 
I don’t think that this product deserves a poor rating because of the size, it literally lists how much product you get it, so in comparison to the size and actual product amount that is in this blush compared to the bronzer that is $12 more the Product amount and pricing reflects that. it’s totally worth it in my opinion the formulas gorgeous and it’s nice to have finally some options as far as cream blushes go really nice shade range.
I say go for it, but also make sure you read everything before you make your decision that way do you know exactly what you’re getting. Don’t listen to bad reviews based off of people being angry at the size.","Beautiful product, Beautiful shade selection,",23 Apr 2020,gioiaa,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes

The color choices leave something to be desired, there could be 1 or 2 more neutral options, Rose latte is too brown and petal poppin too pink.

This is a pretty colour easy too work with and blends nicely even over powder foundation. I appreciate the small size because it would be pretty much double the price if it was the size of the bronzer and I will never go through that much blush anyway. If you do the math in terms of price per 0.01g compared to the bronzer it should be more like 19 dollars Canadian instead of 26. But I understand pigments in a blush may be harder/more expensive to formulate. I am just not sure if it can be justified to be 7 dollars more.

I'd prefer a blush that goes on sheer first, and slowly build it up, than a blush that initially goes on too bold, and mess up my makeup look, then I'd have to wipe it off and re-apply foundation, etc. These are perfect. I already knew the relative size before I bought it after watching YouTube videos,  so it's no surprise. I bought Crush on Cupid and Drama Cla$$. They love the pigmentation,  and it melts into my skin, and looks natural and dewy. Keep shining Riri!",Great product!,22 Apr 2020,DeliciaJ,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I got the color Drama Cla$$ because it looked unlike anything else I owned. It's a great formula for a sheer but buildable flush of color.,Beautiful sheer violet wash,22 Apr 2020,ReneeLiz98,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"a very beautiful color, a little goes a long way. HOWEVER, it is so tiny. when i opened the box i thought i bought a sample size. would buy again, but the size is what makes it 3 stars for me.",good but small,22 Apr 2020,Courtney822,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"i’ve been seeing a lot of bad reviews & i honestly think people just aren’t reading the details when it comes to this product. it clearly states its a natural, sheer wash of colour. if you want a vibrant cream blush- this isn’t the product. yes they’re small but are you really going to use it all up quickly? probably not!! i love these especially for the spring/summer time for those no-makeup makeup days. i purchased 5 shades and i can’t put them down & have gotten a lot of compliments saying my skin looks so natural and healthy!! 100% recommend if you want something effortless",READ THE DETAILS. YES THEY’RE SHEER!!!,22 Apr 2020,maddieeeb,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
The size of this product is laughable. I can’t believe I spent money on this. This would be something you would get as a free perk. I’m offended I was charged 20 bucks for this. Save your money,NOT WORTH 20 DOLLARS,22 Apr 2020,Casedog,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I wanted so badly to love this. I was so excited for this product! The color is so nice, but it just doesn’t transfer. It’s so sheer, the consistency is not good and if it was a good product I would look past the fact that it’s literally a sample size. I can’t. I’m so sad. I love fenty, but they need to rethink this formulation.",,22 Apr 2020,CJM8,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"These are small. Like deluxe sample size small. I was expecting them to be the same size as the Fenty bronzers. I took off a star because of the price. They are sheer and give a pretty wash of color on your cheeks. The one I got (petal pop) makes me look fresh and awake. It’s not sticky once dry. I used a brush to put it on over powder, but I think it would be really pretty on bare skin or a tinted moisturizer. I like it, but I won’t be buying any more.",Okay.,22 Apr 2020,Jamrl16,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Surprised by the bad reviews.. I LOVE these! These blushes are amazing and I ordered 7 out of 10 and may grab one more. They are very pigmented and easy to work with. Fuego is my favorite and looks great on my brown skin. Someone said it wasn't for dark skin and that's just not true. I'm Fenty 420 in foundation. They also layer well together. I prefer using my finger vs a brush. The description says sheer color, but people are complaining about it being sheer? I find it to be more pigmented than I expected. Yes, they are small, but it is a good amount of product. Remember these are cream and won't last as long as a powder expiration wise... So I think it's fine, but I also got 20% off. I say give at least one a try.",Confused by the low stars. Amazing blushes!,22 Apr 2020,2PrettyGirl1908,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This blush is all around a hard pass. First of all, the size of this blush is absolutely ridiculous. It is the size of the SAMPLE Nars blush that was previously given out as a Sephora birthday gift. Secondly, it is VERY SHEER and it takes a lot of product to build up a decent amount of color on my cheeks. This sample pan will be empty in no time except it’s the most expensive sample I’ve ever gotten. Very disappointed.","Expensive, sheer, sample size.",22 Apr 2020,gigiadora16,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Under details it states that this is a sheer blush, and adds a wash of color - so I’m not sure why people are surprised. 

Personally, I prefer sheer blushes because I am very heavy handed. So, if a blush is too pigmented, I end up looking like someone just slapped me. Yes, this blush is sheer as stated under the product details, but it provides you with a beautiful soft wash of color. If you really wanted, you could build the color up but if that’s a look you prefer I’d opt for another blush.",This is a sheer blush as stated in product details,22 Apr 2020,mesmerized,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This is the color I have been wanting from a cream blush! I feel like sometimes my contour doesnt blend seamlessly into my blush causing a neapolitan effect (Eek. I know!) This color is the perfect burnt terra-cotta that makes your cheeks look like the day after you get a pinch of sun, and it blends with the contour so well! Im super fair with olive undertones and this just works! I wish it had a little bit more staying power but I have gotten so many compliments in the 3 days I have worn it.",Firm Yes!,22 Apr 2020,MollyGrace1987,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
The blush formula is beautiful but sheer. Leaves a beautiful luminous flush of color. I removed stars because in my opinion it’s a tiny size for the price.,Tiny,22 Apr 2020,robynbella,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
Refreshing!!!! The cream part is also a nice touch. Applies smoothly and can be worn without foundation. I’ll definitely purchase this again.,,21 Apr 2020,h8toluvme,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Honestly, I have never had much luck with Fenty. Whenever I tried something, It didn't lay right or it looked like I was wearing makeup. I have pretty clear and even skin, so I don't fuss with concealers or foundation other than sheer coverage. I'm a BBB (Brows, Blush/Bronzer, Balm) kind of person and I'm out the door, and (before the pandemic) I'm at the gym 5 times a week before work, so I like makeup I can apply with my fingers in a locker-room mirror. That said, this blush is amazing for that. It's sheer and balmy, but dries down and is not sticky. If you're used to high coverage and super intense pigment, this probably isn't for you. It's very natural. I'm sure it can be layered, but then it might just be ""a lot"" on the skin. Rosé Latte is the perfect shade, it'll give you an ""expensive"" looking flush - like you use the world ""Summer"" as a verb.",,21 Apr 2020,hovin,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I am beyond in love with this product. I have dry skin, so powder blush doesn't look good on me. I've been wanting to get into cream blush and this is AMAZING. The product is small, but it's very pigmented and you do not need a lot AT ALL. It's creamy and makes my skin look plump and dewy, doesn't dry down to a powder. I pat my cheeks with my finger and blend with a beauty sponge and it leaves the perfect flushed tint. I have pale skin and chose Rose Latte and it looks like I have the perfect sunburn. I highly recommend.",Everything I Wanted,21 Apr 2020,RebeccaDot,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
the colour of this blush is so pretty but i find when you put it on the skin it’s very sheer. i find the amount of product you get in it is very small which was a little disappointing too,alright,21 Apr 2020,nicolemasonxox,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"BEAUTIFUL! I got this, and then  Daiquri dip and rose latte. Generally I don't go for orange shades, but thought I'd give this a go, and I was not disappointed! It's this perfect warm flush to the skin that looks so sun kissed and glowy. I'm in love!  I also dislike cream products usually, but this is sheer and buildable. It does not go to a matte finish though, but that's expected considering the texture. 

I paired it with Saw-C for a summer look.",Sooo sooo creamy,21 Apr 2020,DJGard,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Let me start off my saying I am a sucker for cream blushes. I have dry skin and I like to use more creams than powders in my routine. These make you DEWY but not an over the top dewy, a natural dew. Don’t be scared by the pigment in the pan because it is sheer when you apply BUT you can 100% build it to the intensity that you want. I applied this with both my fingers and a beauty blender and I fed prefer my fingers as I feel I get more pigment out of the product. These are really great and I can’t wait to get more colors!!!",Perfect!,21 Apr 2020,clovemakeup,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I had been looking for the perfect orange blush and I finally found it. I think anyone that’s mad over the size just needed to read the description because it clearly states it only contains 3g of product. I personally like the size because I like a natural look not the I put blush all over my face look so I dont use very much.,,21 Apr 2020,Bells0,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
beautiful blush. it's a little small but you don't need to much. it melts into the skin and it's so pretty. i get a lot of compliments when i wear it!,gorgeous blush,21 Apr 2020,JayKoo,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
This review is for Fuego. Pretty in the package but more suited for people about a NC 42 in MAC and lighter. I wear Sheiseido Synchro Skin 460 Topaz and it only showed up as glitter on my cheek,,21 Apr 2020,destiny1920,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"This is smaller than any other cream blush I own. Think large eyeshadow size. I've tried many cream blushes and while the product performs OK, it can go patchy with the wrong moisturizer on, I have used cream blushes that have a better formula. This is ultimately not worth the time to use the small pan and just OK formula. I love many other Fenty products but this missed the mark with all of the hype.",Don't waste time or money.,21 Apr 2020,lks7,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I have a hate/love feeling about this cream blush I like pigmentation and how easy its blends but i don’t like the fact of the mini size and the shimmer it has,Not bad,21 Apr 2020,Maialenb,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Definitely pigmented , this is great everyday blush . Looks great over light foundation or tinted moisturizer. The blush blends out sheer .",,21 Apr 2020,Kkxng826,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"Okay this arrived today and I tried it on my bare face... thankfully it didnt turn pink like it seemed on Fenty's instagram posting. My cheeks were blushing in cool violet, very naturally looking! It is moisturizing, easily blendable and buildable. It can be worn sheer and semi-opaque. I am so down to grab other colors during this sale!","Def worth, take advantage of spring sale!",21 Apr 2020,CoreaDK,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"It definitely does not pack a punch. Which is the point. I knocked off a star because I was hoping the shimmer would be less noticeable or more finely milled/dispersed. It's still gorgeous. 

Do you want a no-makeup glossy look? A hint of earthy orange on golden to neutral skin tones? This is it.",It's almost too sheer,21 Apr 2020,obviouslysubtle,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I got fuego flush and I put it on my skin and it barely showed up. I wear 370 foundation in fenty. I was disappointed to waste my money on something that I thought would fit every skin tone.,Don’t get fuego if you’re brown skin or darker,21 Apr 2020,Eyelia,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"The people who are giving this negative reviews clearly don’t know what this product is intended for. “Fresh faced”, it’s literally mentioned in all the fenty videos. Not full beat. Fresh faced. Why would you put a sheer cream blush on top of the 5 layers of makeup you’re wearing. Come on ladies. You should know better. These are wonderful for us gals who live in the real world. Not an IG full coverage world. :)",Fresh faced. Not full coverage beat blush!,20 Apr 2020,CheekyBee,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I love cream blushes and cream products in general, and while these colors are gorgeous and the blend ability is good I just cannot recommend them! When they arrived I thought Sephora had messed up and sent me sample sizes, these are teeny tiny. Not worth the $20 price tag In my opinion when there is tons of wonderful cream blushes on the market where you can get more for your money. Spend your money on other cream products that’ll be more worth it.","Pretty, but too tiny for the price.",20 Apr 2020,RikkiTay,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I was slightly surprised with how small the compact is! I attached a pic of the cream blush vs the standard Fenty compact size. It's so cute! That being said, this is pigment packed. I have fair skin and the shade Summertime Wine is a gorgeous natural flush IF you go easy on her. I think Fenty's statement 'impossible to overdo' is a bit of a overstatement haha. It's so sheer and performs more like a balmy stain than a cream. Despite the size this will last a long time. The finish is beautiful, lasting power is great, pigment is great. But it does look more like a mini size. That being said, it's freaking adorable, and will be such a breeze to travel with!!",Here's Why It's Bomb.,20 Apr 2020,Adino,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I have been looking for a no-makeup makeup blush. This is the perfect shade for me. I also love Daiquiri Dip & Strawberry Drip. Highly recommend. I am 420 in her foundations. DISCLAIMER: Now here’s the thing. If you want a cream blush for a full beat I don’t think this is the best item on the market. Read the grams people! I see a lot of comments about the size and yes, it’s small. Also, yes you STILL most likely won’t finish the product. How many blushes have y’all really gone through? Exactly. I think the size makes since because I will probably actually work through this in the year it has to expire. I tend not to care about expiration for powder products but it’s important to me with cream and liquid products.",Read This To Make This Product Make Sense,20 Apr 2020,misst1028,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I really like this blush!  I'm seeing some negative reviews and I'm wondering if the formula varies depending on color or shimmer??  I bought Crush on Cupid, a bright mid toned pink, and although it's a small pan, a little goes a long way.  

I apply it with a Sigma duofiber brush over powder foundation and bronzer without any problems. I tap the brush into the blush, apply it directly to my cheeks and it blends easily, doesn't lift up anything underneath and set down nicely. It's not a cream to powder formula but it doesn't remain sticky or tacky.

I absolutely recommend this blush, although I can only speak for this color, but I like it so much that I may try one more.  For reference, MAC NW10 is my closest foundation match and my skin type is combo/dry.",Crush on Cupid is great!,20 Apr 2020,cara80,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"I mean it’s not bad but it is extremely small. I was disappointed with the price and amount that it came with. Granted it is pretty but for $20 I don’t think it’s worth. I wish it was bigger for the amount that it came with why couldn’t it cheaper? It’s pretty but not enough product especially since I love blush. Would I recommend this to a friend, no just because it’s small and pricy other than that if you don’t use that much blush a daily basis this will probably last 3 months or so.",cute but it’s small and pricey,20 Apr 2020,Rubi888,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"These Fenty blushes are incredible! I purchased Cool Berry, Bikini Martini, and Drama Cla$$ and couldn't be more satisfied. The application of this gel cream formula is sheer yet buildable. The colors are bright and fresh with an unexpected level of pigmentation. The color is easily muted with a bit of powder but I can't imagine why one would want to. These are beautiful! I look forward to owning several more.",I'm in love!,20 Apr 2020,Incorporeity,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
"the blush is thin and sheer but buildable. good enough, but this comes with way too little product especially for a sheer blush. I actually thought they sent me a sample by mistake! Not worth the price.

"Fenty really needs to rethink their cheek products. Like the original powder bronzers, the product itself is nice enough, I guess, but the tiny amount of product doesn't justify the high price tag, especially when you compare to other high end brands. The product itself is pretty sheer, which would normally be nice because you can really customize the amount of pigmentation you want when applying but considering how little product is in each unit, I don't see this lasting long at all. Also, like most blushes, this isn't long wearing, which means you need to reapply and use even more product. There's equivalent and even far better quality products on the market that give you more bang for your buck. This ain't it.",Tiny amount of product with little payoff,20 Apr 2020,katiemcgann,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
I was so excited for this release. The product is too sheer glossy and sticky. Reminded me of the Nudestix Glossy Blush which I hate. Don't waste your money on it. If you want a good cream blush get the MAC Glow blush or Shiseido mousse blush. Sure they are more expensive but worth the money.,A big no-no,20 Apr 2020,Alena2124,Fenty Beauty,Blush,Yes
