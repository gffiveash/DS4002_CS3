Awesome product,30 Jan 2025,"The Huda Beauty Faux Filler Gloss in the shade ‚ÄúUBE‚Äù is definitely a showstopper!

It‚Äôs the kind of gloss that would make you feel confident, like you‚Äôre ready to take on the world, while adding that extra pop of shine to your look.

It‚Äôs disappointing to see that it‚Äôs sold out (no surprise, considering how stunning it looks), but that just speaks to how much people love it!

The packaging is nice I love that it‚Äôs clear so you can see exactly how much is left and the applicator is a very pointed doe foot which allows for perfect application. It does have a fragrance which to me smells like powdered sugar which I really love but if you don‚Äôt like scented products you may not appreciate it.

Ube is a purple sweet potato so when you give a lipgloss the name Ube, I better see purple. Unfortunately this was like a run of the mill pink lipgloss. I‚Äôm so disappointed, I like the feel of this lipgloss line but as a brown woman I was excited for a purple lipgloss that looked purple in the bottle and out of the bottle. Please reformulate this product.",kchandwani21,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Truly Magic!,28 Jan 2025,"WOW! This has been my go-to lipgloss for the past week and I‚Äôve received many compliments on the look. It‚Äôs such a subtle color, and looks great on. My lips look so juicy and full. It‚Äôs truly magic. It blurs out unwanted lines and really makes my lips look and feel amazing! I love how this product doesn‚Äôt leave me with a tingling, burning sensation but still gets the job done. I only have positive feedback for this product and absolutely blown away at its potential. Huda, great job on this product. 10/10 would definitely recommend!",Arpalcher,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Moisturizing,28 Jan 2025,I really like this lipgloss. The color is a nice light sheer pink. The lipgloss is moisturizing and not sticky. It keeps my lips soft for an awhile so I‚Äôm happy with this lip product by Huda. I would recommend,Avru9829,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Just the pop of gloss you need!,28 Jan 2025,I was really impressed by this lip gloss! It‚Äôs the first one I‚Äôve ever owned that doesn‚Äôt dry my lips out after use. The color is natural with a hint of pink and so it gives just a tiny pop to my barely there type makeup I wear. It definitely has a glossy finish. Packaging is cute too!,greatskingal,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Super glossy,27 Jan 2025,"New faux filler gloss - Ube (Electric lilac with subtle hues of pink) is such a beautiful gloss. I love the lilac hues and a super shiny formula that plumps the lips without the burning sensation. Unfortunately, it is slightly sticky and you will feel it. My favorite part about this gloss it‚Äôs how shiny it is!",Ausra90,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,27 Jan 2025,"The applicator is unique! It's my first time trying out this type of applicator for a lipgloss. I'm a fan! It makes it so easy and precise! Now, let's talk about the glossiness. It's so glossy and definitely hydrating to the lips. It's not as sticky, which I love! There is a slight scent to it, which some people will find a con, but I don't love/hate it. I would definitely want to try the other shades!",000giselle000,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Classy,27 Jan 2025,"The HUDA BEAUTY Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss is perfect for no-makeup makeup days. Its subtle pink hue looks natural, the non-sticky formula feels light, and the glossy finish adds a radiant touch.",elaineypena,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

,27 Jan 2025,"I got this as a gift in exchange for a review and fell in love with it!! It‚Äôs such a natural pretty shine!! And it goes well over lip stain for me to blend out my double lip line. Really love this!! It‚Äôs not sticky, has virtually no smell or taste. It does clump in the corners of my mouth though.",erinestelle,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Best as always,27 Jan 2025,"I tried the UBE - Faux Filler Gloss from Huda Beauty, and I have to say, the formula is surprisingly plush. It gives a smooth, cushiony feel on the lips‚Äîdefinitely not sticky, which I appreciate. The plumping effect is subtle but noticeable, adding a nice fullness without that intense tingling some glosses have. The shine is gorgeous, giving that high-impact, juicy look, and the color payoff is impressive for a gloss. It layers well over lipstick or looks beautiful on its own. I also like that it doesn‚Äôt dry out my lips, though I wouldn‚Äôt call it deeply hydrating either. Overall, it‚Äôs a solid gloss if you love a plump, glossy finish with a comfortable feel. I‚Äôll definitely keep reaching for it!",Khoshnood,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
New favorite gloss,27 Jan 2025,"First of all, I love the shape of the applicator. It is perfect for application and other companies need to take note!

Feels Nice on LIps,27 Jan 2025,"The color UUU-Baby is a light transparent pink with a mirror-like shine and no sparkle. The color swatch on the website is accurate.  It is a non-sticky, moisturizing, thick formula that fills in any cracks and gaps in your lips. It goes well over lipstick but it is also nice to use on its own as it has a really nice feel to it. It doesn‚Äôt have any kind of long wear. It wipes off very easily and leaves a visible lip mark when I am drinking out of a glass/mug/water bottle. The applicator has a white triangular felt tip that makes applying the product easy even with my deep cupid‚Äôs bow. I thought with a title like Faux Filler there would be some plumping product added to the formula, but it is only a gloss which was a little disappointing. This color sadly washed out my lips on its own. I will likely use it with lipstick underneath all the time but I would be interested in trying a darker shade in the future.",starartist135,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
High Shine!,27 Jan 2025,"This faux filler gloss in the shade UUU-Baby delivers some serious shine! The shade is a light, milky pinkish-purple infused with moisturizing ingredients that really smooth and soften lips, blurring the look of fine lines.

Very nice lipgloss,27 Jan 2025,"I was gifted this lipgloss complementary from huda beauty. First of all this smells so good and feels really hydrating on my lips.

Worth trying!!,27 Jan 2025,This lip gloss is so fresh and pretty. It's a light lilac color and goes on slightly pink. It's not very pigmented so I like using this the most when aiming for a light gloss effect! I like the size because you clearly get a nice amount of product.,Dorothydee3,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Incredible shiny,27 Jan 2025,"to begin with, this gloss has a different applicator shape, it is much more convenient to apply the gloss in the corners of the lips, secondly, the gloss is just wow, super shiny, but the most important thing is that it is not sticky and has a dense texture, that is, the declared and real color match))",Mursik,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
The most comfortable lip gloss in my arsenal.,27 Jan 2025,"The Huda Beauty Faux Filler Gloss in ""Uuu Baby"" delivers a high shine, non sticky finish with a subtle lilac tint. It feels hydrating on my lips and does a decent job of blurring fine lines. While the ""faux filler"" effect might be minimal, it's a pretty and comfortable gloss option for everyday wear.
Pros are that it gives off a high shine. It's not sticky, and very hydrating with a beautiful subtle color.
Now for the cons which there just aren't many except I have only noticed a minimal ""faux filler"" effect. I think the hyaluronic acid just slightly plumps my lips. However it is nice, and very comfortable to wear.
Overall I think it does a very decent option for those seeking a comfortable, high shine gloss with a touch of color.",Poppies1977,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Super hydrating,27 Jan 2025,"I just love the UBE - FAUX FILLER GLOSS it provides great hydration to the lips, love the lite tint that looks super natural, I have been using it daily and love it. Love the packaging it's so aestheticly pleasing. It's a must buy

Love this gloss!,26 Jan 2025,"This faux filler gloss by Huda Beauty has been my absolute new favorite! To start I am obsessed with the tube. Although it is a little big, the look and pretty tube makes up for needing a little extra room in the makeup bag.

Not completely sold,26 Jan 2025,My first gloss from Huda beauty. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect especially from a lilac color. The color works great for me on top of a lip shade but not alone. As for the texture it‚Äôs thick but not stick. It‚Äôs a gloss you‚Äôre aware it‚Äôs on your lips. It‚Äôs not one I would reach for too much since I feel very sensitive to what‚Äôs on my lips.,heyjay21,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,26 Jan 2025,"One of my favorite gloss formulas. This one feels lightweight and doesn‚Äôt feel heavy or sticky. I also love the new shade part of the Ube line as it gives a flattering cool pink finish without being too over powering on my medium tan skin.

Great,26 Jan 2025,"I really like using this lip gloss, it has a very soft texture and the color is just amazing, it does not stick or roll on the lips, convenient and cute packaging and a very pleasant smell. I am very pleased to take such a cute lip gloss out of my bag.",Hiosan,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Overall, I‚Äôd highly recommend the Huda Beauty Lip Gloss if you‚Äôre looking for a high-quality, long-lasting gloss that feels great and looks stunning.",129amym,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,26 Jan 2025,I am sad to say this was not my favorite. Maybe it is just the milky color of this that washes me out or the thick texture but this does not look great on me. The packaging is very pretty and the other colors in this line are much nicer on the lips.,VSPinkGirl,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

So pretty,25 Jan 2025,"To begin, I love the soft pink color and packaging. It's just so pretty to look at! The scent is candy-like to me but without being overpowering. I only have the clear faux filler to compare it to and I feel like this one is slightly thinner but not by much. 
It is sheer and on my lips, it adds a small amount of a light milky wash of pink color. It does look nice over a liner too",SDdenm,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Might be a new favorite!,24 Jan 2025,"I wouldn‚Äôt say this gives a faux filler effect but I commend the long wear nature of it for being a lip gloss. I love the color! As a very fair skinned girl it can be hard to find light, cool toned pinks in glosses. My only other qualm - it smells okay but I absolutely cringe if and when any of the gloss gets in my mouth. The taste is so, so foul. I definitely prefer the scents of other major glosses (like MAC) or without scent at all (like Tower 28).",jalberta113,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,24 Jan 2025,"I am not stranger to huda beauty products and have even tried the clear version of this gloss.

Mislead,23 Jan 2025,"This has a nice gloss and smell. I don't know if I should blame the salesperson or HUDA but I asked for a lip plumping gloss and this is what she highly recommended and preferred over other brands. I tried it at home and it did not plump my lips, no tingling sensation like other plumpers so I know it doesn't work as a ""Filler"" or plumper. I have thin lips so I was really hoping this would help.",Sophiebeans,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Truly phenomenal lip gloss for picky people!,23 Jan 2025,"I am a very picky lipgloss person. I can not and will NOT tolerate thick, gloopy glosses that don't stay in place OR syrupy sticky glosses. I want my lip gloss to make my lips look better, not like I just drank a glossy floor wax loaded with glitter. I was suuuuper hesitant about Huda's new Ube Faux Filter gloss because the color looked like it might be weird with my fair skintone/red hair. This was in addition to my normal gloopy/sticky lip gloss skepticism that I have with every lip gloss. However when I tell you I fell in LOVE on first application I am not exaggerating. It is pure perfection in lip gloss form. It's not sticky or gloopy. It stays in place for a surprisingly long time for a lip gloss! It has an incredible cushion-like feel that both feels great and makes your lips look amazing. I have the clear in this formula but this one is way better! I have to mention too the smell is the BEST. It smells like marshmallows. It's perfect.",redsugarbucket,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
It's perfect! A little goes a long way!,23 Jan 2025,"My favorite lip gloss!!!! I had to try UUU BABY, I have the corresponding setting powder and blush and I absolutely love them.

But it is just the perfect baby pink just a little goes a long way, it is not sticky it doesn't leave any film or yuckiness on your lips after the product has dried. It's the perfect sheer baby pink! This might just be my new favorite shade! ",priscilla30,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Pretty look and smell; thick and heavy wear,23 Jan 2025,"I'm extremely picky when it comes to all lip products, but especially glosses, and this is my first time trying any of Huda's lip products. I've wanted a sheer, milky pink gloss that doesn't make my lips look too frosted or white for a while. Color-wise, this accomplishes that beautifully. My lips are pretty pink naturally, and this has enough pigment to not look like I put a clear gloss on without adding a heavy white cast. The scent is strong but delicious - maybe I'm being primed by the name of the shade, but I can't shake the feeling that this gloss actually smells like ube butter? On the other hand, the formula is just ok. It lives up to the name and is not sticky, but it does feel thick and heavy on my lips, particularly the outer corners. I certainly feel the product on my lips, and the product moves and pools up a bit as I rub my lips together rather than allowing for a slip and glide that I find more satisfying. That said, my lips are in a horrendously chapped and flaky state this winter, and the thickness of the formula (while not the most comfortable for me personally) does do a decent job at filling in fine lines and wrinkles in my lips for a smooth, plump look. Not my favorite gloss I've ever worn, but I like it enough to use the full tube. I'd give this a 3.5 if I could.",jag02010,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Perfect shade of light pink!,23 Jan 2025,"I am such a fan of HUDA Beauty and this Faux Filler line, so I was super excited to try their gloss in the shade UBE and I AM OBSESSED! Firstly, I love the consistency of this gloss! It feels so good on the lips while providing a super shiny finish. The UBE shade is also the perfect shade of pink and I feel this shade could work on almost any skin tone. It‚Äôs a pretty light pink, but the level of pigmentation allows it to work for my darker skin tone. This shade is also perfect for creating different lip looks with other shades. Overall, I am loving this gloss and I am recommending it to everyone!",Leshaeveon,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,23 Jan 2025,"I wasn't sure how I would feel about this shade, but I do like it. The gloss is mostly sheer with a hint of milky pink coloring.

Not purple!,23 Jan 2025,This gloss is deceptively labeled. It doesn‚Äôt look purple at all but rather very light pink. Light enough that it barely has a tint on my melanated lips.

The texture is nice and it isn‚Äôt too sticky but this color isn‚Äôt it for me.,ramiek,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Like it!,23 Jan 2025,"I was happy to try the Huda Beauty Faux Filler Gloss. It has a smooth, creamy texture that glides on effortlessly without being sticky. The gloss provides a beautiful, shiny finish with a slight milky pink tint that enhances my natural lip color without being overpowering. It's super hydrating, which is a huge bonus, and doesn't cling to dry spots, making it perfect for everyday wear. I love how it plumps up my lips with a blurred effect‚Äîgiving them that fuller, juicy look.
The formula is a bit on the thicker side, so if you prefer lighter glosses, this may not be your ideal choice, but personally, I love how plush it feels. I also like layering it over darker lip liners for a stunning effect. I also like it sweet warm scent. 
I‚Äôm really happy with this gloss and will definitely be trying more shades. It‚Äôs the perfect everyday gloss that gives me a glossy, plump look without being too much! Highly recommend if you want something moisturizing and long-lasting with a beautiful finish.",may1155,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

,9 Mar 2024,"The Huda Faux Filler lip gloss is a really nice option if you like a thick gloss! I have this one in Glassy, which is the clear shade. Texture--wise I would compare it most closely to the Colourpop So Juicy glosses but less sticky and with no tingling. It's shiny, but not wildly so. A little sticky, not enough to give gloss strings when you move your lips apart, but enough that it doesn't really glide across your lips when you go to apply it. Very very thick in a way that I really enjoy as I think it makes my lip lines look a little less pronounced (the faux filler in action!) and usually lasts longer than a thinner gloss. The gloss lasted and seemed completely unaffected by drinking; I didn't eat with it on but imagine it would perform similarly well with most foods. Also glad it's not a plumping gloss, so no irritation! It has a light sort of vanilla cupcake scent but I don't notice much of a taste. The tube is a pretty good size and has some nice heft to it, it doesn't feel like it would break if I dropped it. The applicator is pretty big and scoops up quite a bit of gloss, but I just sort of dotted it in the middle of my lips and then rubbed them together + used the very tip of the applicator to spread it into the thinner parts instead of swiping all the way across and that worked fine without adding excess product. It applied nicely over lipliner and is comfortable to wear. Overall I'm a big fan and I'll be looking at trying out the other colors!

A bonus: the package has a seal! So you can tell if the Sephora kids have messed with these before buying",chirp321,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

"Bravo, Huda Beauty, on another fantastic product!",10 Mar 2024,"I received the FauxFiller Lip Gloss in exchange for my honest feedback. The packaging is not only visually stunning but also practical to hold and easy to access. The scent evokes different associations for me; caramel apples for myself, tootsie rolls according to my mother, and coconuts as per my dad. However, the scent remains subtle and not overpowering. Although the applicator tip is different from what I'm accustomed to, I found myself becoming a fan quickly. It efficiently picks up product and the contoured shape makes for precise application. The gloss glides on smoothly, leaving my lips looking line-free and without any sticky sensation. While I can feel it on my lips, it's not uncomfortable. I can easily see myself incorporating this into my daily routine; it's perfect for tossing in your bag and heading out. Paired with the Huda Lip Contour, it's a winning combination.

,9 Mar 2024,"I received the Faux Filler Extra Shine Lip Gloss from Huda Beauty. i have mixed feeling about it. On the positive side, the promise of hydration is definitely delivered. My lips feel moisturized and comfortable throughout the day.

While I appreciate a glossy finish, this lip gloss tends to lean towards being overly shiny for my taste. In fact, it gives off a vibe that my lips are a bit too oily, which isn‚Äôt the look I‚Äôm going for. Another thing worth noting is the staying power. While the gloss impresses initially with its shine, it tends to wear off pretty quickly, especially after a meal or a sip of my favorite drink.",royalheart,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

I like to use the glassy clear shade with a lip liner for a pop of color and it's perfection. Now excuse me while I go order one in every color!",jojomaria,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,11 Mar 2024,I love lip glosses and huda beauty so I was excited to try their gloss. Most glosses now a days are lip plumping but huda's isnt. Hers is supposed to help fill in the lines in your lips which was intriguing. When first applied it felt really nice and not sticky. The applicator was also nice and with a rounded point. It also had a cavity to help hold onto product but I would scrape some off as it was a little too much for me. After giving it some time my lips did look smoother and the lines were less noticeable. I really want to try there tinted versions now.,amejia27,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Usually after like 10 minutes, gloss will get sticky or get that crunchy feeling, but even after 30 minutes, it still felt as silky as when I put it on.

I feel like this is false advertising?,11 Mar 2024,It hurts me to type that I didn‚Äôt love this gloss because I do love Huda. I think marketing this as ‚Äúfaux filler‚Äù combined with it only being shown on lips WITH filler was a little deceiving. I definitely thought I was getting a plumping gloss and would never pay this for just a regular gloss.,YoutuberSarah,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Glassy looks classy!,11 Mar 2024,"I usually don't like lip gloss because chances are they are sticky and uncomfortable. So i went in with low expectations. It's a good price at $19. Cute packaging. With a large flat doe foot applicator. I've never seen one shaped like this before but it applies to the lips well. Smells yummy like vanilla. Doesnt have a taste which is nice. The formula is thick but isn't sticky at all. I was pleasantly surprised.  Glassy is clear shiny shade. Looks good on. Works great as a topper also. Last for a couple hours but it's actually hydrating. I was just getting over being sick when I tried this for the first time. My lips were pretty dry. But after applying, a couple hours later my lips were soft and hydrated. This gloss does a great job of giving the lips a shiny full appearance by filling in the lip lines. This is perfect for those who want the appearance of fuller lips but don't want to have to deal with the stinging formula of a plumper. I'm sold but I'm also rarely let down by Huda products. Would definitely recommend.",Lovelypanic,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Great Texture,11 Mar 2024,"This gloss is super thick and lux on my lips.  I have CHRONICALLY dry lips and this actually helps hide the dryness.  The thickness is awesome because it kinda glides on, rather than feeling sticky and it gives my lips a nice cushion to absorb the hydrating ingredients.  It's also a really pretty top coat.

But when you have it in person it actually looks good and has some weight to it so it is not a lightweight plastic. The issue I have with the Glassy clear shade is that the product is not as crystal clear as the packaging. I understand that it is because of the mixture of ingredients but it kind of has a hue in it that makes it cloudy which seems like a little dirty compared to the crystal clear packaging. The doe foot might be a little big for my own lips but the tip of it and how it glides is a pleasurable experience. I have watched other people review the product saying it was gloopy but it was not the case for me. Maybe they have put a lot on. For me it was not that thick of a gloss not that thin either. Other people prefer the thick formula and I don‚Äôt. Is it the shiniest gloss? No. There are others I have tried that has a shinier finish. Does it provide hydration? A little bit. It is not the most nourishing product. Does it plump the lips? No and it never claimed that. Does it blur the lines on the lips? From a far, but when you look up close it does not. As much as I love most of Huda Beauty items and love them as a brand this is very much middle of the road for me. I can still see myself using it all up. But not to a point that I will repurchase. I would like to provide my honest feedback hoping for improvement and I know that when they tweak this they will make a home run. It barely has a scent of vanilla slight coco. Very very faint which is fine by me. All in all I am not gonna miss the product if I don‚Äôt have it in my collection. Looking forward to other products they produce plus more. This is just Huda‚Äôs comeback to the company as the CEO and have full trust in her that she has tons and tons of products that will blow our minds and can‚Äôt live without.",Gel123,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
SO GOOD,12 Mar 2024,It‚Äôs so glossy!! It smells like cupcakes and it‚Äôs perfect with a lip liner!! I love the name too!! It‚Äôs so glossy and not sticky at all!! Love! Definitely one of my new favorite lip products!! GO BUY IT!!!,laurentay1010,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
It could be better!,11 Mar 2024,"I was expecting a bit more from Huda Beauty‚Äôs Faux Filler Lipgloss but it didn‚Äôt quite stand out to me. The packaging is very cute and simple, though the applicator is a little tougher and louder to remove from the bottle. The shape of the applicator makes it easier to apply, especially with how much product it holds in one go. It‚Äôs bit of a thicker consistency, smells like vanilla bean, and is very shiny. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt seem to last very long once applied and melts into the lips relatively quickly. It also didn‚Äôt blur out the lines on my lips like it claimed it would do. I think this would‚Äôve been a better product if it had the lip plumping effect. I‚Äôll continue to use the rest but don‚Äôt have any intentions on purchasing it myself.",craemay,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Sticky,12 Mar 2024,"I‚Äôve loved every Huda Beauty product that I‚Äôve used, but this one isn‚Äôt for me.

Pros:

* No weird taste if you lick your lips while wearing it.

Cons:

* Applicator is a bit hard to remove from bottle. 
* Sticky.

,12 Mar 2024,I got the clear lipgloss which works perfectly for applying on top of any of lipstick. This lipgloss has the same consistency as the elf/dior lip oils. I‚Äôm not fond of the applicator (triangle shaped) because it is unevenly spread on the lips.,LaisaH,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Love it,12 Mar 2024,"This lipgloss is stunning! The color is vibrant and sparkly and doesn‚Äôt apply too thick. It doesn‚Äôt last forever and will need to be reapplied, however the color makes up for that as it‚Äôs pigmented just enough with a lot of dimension without being overpowering or too dark or glittery in feel.

It was triangular?",sammy7679,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Super hydrating no stickiness,12 Mar 2024,The packaging of the goods is super cute!

I received something in exchange for this post,dreap123,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,12 Mar 2024,"Honestly, I doubted the supposedly ""not retouched"" images initially. I took my own pictures and what do you know - it's true. This lip gloss is SO mirror-like that you can see my light reflecting off my lips lol! It really does clearly ""erase"" lip lines as well, and instead leaves lips looking very smooth. I'm most impressed by how truly non-sticky this is. I don't think I've ever tried a lip gloss that is this glossy and yet isn't tacky.

It smells absolutely incredible and I do like the unique applicator as well. It suits the product perfectly. I can actually see this becoming my go-to lip gloss, which is quite a statement given the sea of gloss options out there. It's a hit!",Alicehoopz,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

The BEST Gloss collection!,12 Mar 2024,"This gloss is so amazing I already have all the shades. It is smooth, medium thickness and never sticky. It‚Äôs so high gloss and multidimensional, fills in all lines of the lips and smells just like the liquid lipsticks (Hawaiian Tropic vibes). Although I‚Äôm reviewing clear which is very universal, works amazing on its own or top of lip liners and lipsticks/stains, the other shades are also amazing neutral colours. They are very pigmented, delivering gorgeous wash of colour while still remaining partly translucent like a glossy tint. It‚Äôs very long wearing and just pure magic for the lips.

It's slick but not watery or sticky and I was impressed by the really high shine I got from it. I do not feel as though it filled in my lines.

I‚Äôve grown to be a fan of HudaBeauty over the years for their high quality products at a good price and this doesn‚Äôt cut short of the reputation either. Would buy it in more colors too! Totally recommend giving it a try.,Nida123,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

I was sent the color glassy which is just a clear gloss but it‚Äôs super thick and feels nourishing and it‚Äôs not sticky. It smells like a summer vacation which I absolutely love! The packaging is nice and sleep and the tube feels heavy and is completely clear, I think it looks cool.",smhsiguenza,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
SUPER GLOSSY AND NOURISHING,12 Mar 2024,The packaging is so cute. The gloss right off the bat felt AMAZING on my lips. It felt really nourishing and not tacky.

Love the formula and new applicator,12 Mar 2024,"First, this smells so good I want to eat it. Not only does it smell like a vanilla cupcake, but it also kind of tastes like one too. I have the glassy clear one; it‚Äôs not crystal clear in the tube, but it‚Äôs clear and shiny on the lips. This has to be my favorite applicator. It‚Äôs curved, so it hugs the lips, which is a joy to use. The formula is thick but doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or tacky. This is a win for me",Lunarey,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Not Impressed,12 Mar 2024,"I was lucky to have tried Huda Beauty, Faux Filler Shiny Lip Gloss in Clear. I love Huda Beauty, especially their eyeshadows. But, they fell short on this gloss. In no way, shape, or form was this a lip plumper! The consistency is extremely sticky. One perk, it makes the lips look great!!",ChickyD83,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
"Pretty, but Not for Me",12 Mar 2024,"The Faux Filter Shiny Lip Gloss in Glass is so pretty! It‚Äôs super reflective, and gives your lips a beautiful smooth, pouty look. It‚Äôs just a classic gloss that gives such a mirror-like shine to the lips. I like the versatility of the clear shade‚Ä¶it‚Äôs so easy to layer over other lip products for added dimension, or to wear on its own for low makeup days. It‚Äôs thick and doesn‚Äôt move around, but not sticky, which is nice. Plus, the pointy doe-foot applicator is a great design. This isn‚Äôt a plumping gloss, so it doesn‚Äôt have any of those stinging or burning ingredients, but unfortunately, something in this still really irritated my lips. I think it might be the fragrance, which is quite strong. So unfortunately, even though it‚Äôs a beautiful formula, it wasn‚Äôt right for me.",Larkspur37,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
New fav,12 Mar 2024,So so so impressed! I expected nothing less from huda beauty but this gloss is everything! Plumping but feels nourishing at the same time. Not sticky at all which is my favorite type of gloss! And works amazing over other lip products!,AlejandraS00,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

My new favorite gloss,12 Mar 2024,"I was slightly disappointed about trying glassy instead of a color until I tried it. The formula smells sweet and delicious and while it doesn‚Äôt taste like anything in particular, it also doesn‚Äôt taste bad, so I‚Äôm pleased. It smells like a sweet mix of chocolate, vanilla, sugar cookie. The applicator is very large, not necessarily a bad thing but it is a slight struggle to get it out of the tube. The gloss itself is pretty thick but it‚Äôs a plushy thick and very smooth. It is not sticky at all. I‚Äôll definitely be purchasing other colors. While I received this as a promotion the thoughts and opinions are purely my own.",olliethelittle,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Shiny and Hydrating,12 Mar 2024,"I got the ""Huda Beauty Faux Filler Shiny lip gloss"" in Glassy, which is clear. This gloss is amazing. The formula is exactly what I look for in a lip gloss.

It also has a slight flavor that isn't overwhelming. I will be trying the other colors and definitely recommend this lip gloss.",momreviews,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

It really does fill in the little lines on your lips, it‚Äôs soooo hydrating and it lasts on your lips for the longest time.

Can‚Äôt wait to get it in every shade!!",lisettejmnz,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Pretty good gloss but it dried out my lips,13 Mar 2024,"Of allllll the makeup/personal care product categories my number one obsession has always been lip products. Lipstick, lip gloss, lip balm, lip oil, lip stains, lip masks. I have an entire army of each of them. I don't leave the house without at least one of them in my pocket or purse. I am *extremely* picky about each one, particularly lip gloss. I don't like sticky lipglosses (who does??), I don't like lip glosses that disappear within 10 minutes and I don't like lip glosses that interfere with the lipsticks I'm applying them over. When I saw Huda release these lipglosses I wasn't intrigued at all at first but I ultimately couldn't resist trying Glassy, the clear gloss. The packaging is hefty and nice and the smell is lovely. Not overpowering, not perfumey. The applicator is excellent and allows you to apply the thick-ish gloss accurately and evenly.  And the gloss really does fill in the lines in your lips. The gloss is not even slightly sticky and it wears well even through a light snack and a cup of coffee.  It doesn't smear lipstick underneath and it just looks fantastic! The only issue I had was after wearing it all day this gloss made my lips feel very dry. I had to turn to some of my most moisturizing balms to remoisturize my lips.",redsugarbucket,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

The clear packaging is pretty and aesthetic, it has a really good stopper, and the doe foot has little wells for the gloss to go in so you get enough product and don‚Äôt need to dip back in.

Loved the consistency!(thick),13 Mar 2024,"I received something in exchange for this post but I am obligated to give my full & honest review! I loved this gloss so much. It has a sweet light smell, not overpowering at all. And it‚Äôs just the perfect consistency. I am very picky when it comes to lip glosses and really only use one brand when it comes to buying them. This gloss lived up to the standards. Only thing I will say is that yes it does conceal your lip lines as the CEO/brand claims but not entirely. I feel like it‚Äôs portrayed as it being able to make your lips look completely seamless and it‚Äôs not like that. Yes it does help fill them in to give you a plumper/cleaner look but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôll get rid of them entirely",loveprettyash,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Exceptional Ultra Shine Lip Gloss,13 Mar 2024,"I was gifted this from Huda Beauty in exchange for my honest review.

üîò FAUX FILLER Extra Shine Lip Gloss
in Shade Glassy (Clear)

Personally l‚Äôve not tried a gloss like this before. It feels so incredibly luxurious and hydrating with its smooth almost buttery texture.  Without being sticky or tacky which l really like. It seems to be in a league of its own. 

Once applied it looks like I‚Äôve used a plumping gloss, but without any discomfort. The formulation is spectacular and Vitamin E and infused Vegan Collagen. Helping to smooths and blurs fine lines on the lips. I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs and yes it really does works.

With such a heavenly scent and ultra high gloss finish, I love it.  Yet again Huda Beauty made another product that totally slays!  My recommendation is you have to try it, I‚Äôm keen to get my hands on the other six (coloured) shades.",SusanReviews,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

plumps and fills lips plus shine,13 Mar 2024,"The Faux Filler Lip Gloss in Glassy from Huda Beauty is a clear, high shine gloss. With a slim, flexible doe foot that fits perfectly to the lip, it glides on smoothly and easily. The formula is vanilla scented (as well as lightly flavored) and non sticky.

Great Simple Gloss,14 Mar 2024,I love Huda Beauty so I was excited to try this lip gloss. I received the shade glassy which is clear. It looked great alone for a more hydrated lip look but you could easily pair it with your favorite lipstick or liner. I agree with the claim that it‚Äôs non sticky. It‚Äôs very comfortable on the lips. It isn‚Äôt too thick where it becomes goopy but it has enough tack to hold on for several hours of wear. The smell is light and sweet and the uniquely shaped applicator allowed me to apply it perfectly. My lips really did look fuller upon application and I‚Äôm so glad it isn‚Äôt one of those tingly cinnamon glosses because my lips are too sensitive for those. The formula is great and the shade range is so pretty that I might end up picking up another shade or two!,vicallison,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

I used hardly any product, a ton a product and all in between. it was always sticky, goopy, constantly left a weird line on my lips where the top and bottom touched, and was so thick no matter how much I used. the color is perfect right when you swipe it on but it instantly migrates. the shine stays but really not worth it of the color is inconsistent. Most of the reviews are for the clear so maybe pigment is what throws the formula off. I cant imagine the other colors perform any better. I will be returning.",catiemarie94,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

As far as it being ‚Äúfaux filler‚Äù‚Ä¶I wouldn‚Äôt say this product made my lips look any smoother or bigger. The glassy finish is what‚Äôs going to make them look juicy and plump but it‚Äôs not going to give the appearance of bigger fuller lips in my opinion. I like it and would recommend to a friend!

The formula is wonderful. It smoothes out my lip lines so beautifully and I love that it's not sticky. I highly recommend getting this lip gloss!,Seva23,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,15 Mar 2024,It‚Äôs such a good gloss. It‚Äôs very long lasting as well. I got the clear one and it does so good with all the liners and it doesn‚Äôt dry out fast so I don‚Äôt find myself having to reapply constantly. I really enjoy it and I‚Äôm looking into getting more shades.,jocelyndelcvmpo,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Disappointed,16 Mar 2024,"I really wanted to love this. I did. The formula is just not very good. I'm thinking that it's a little too pigmented-it settled into the lines of my lips. Maybe if you have lip filler it'll look fine.On top of that, it's not really that glossy. I notice that i get little bubbles on my lips after 10 minutes?These just came out so the idea of getting an expired product is out of the question. Maybe i just got a bad batch.",haileyv0529,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Really fills in lips!!,16 Mar 2024,"Loving this lip gloss!! I got the clear shade, it‚Äôs smells nice and I love that I can wear this over any lipstick color and make it my own. This gloss really gives a fuller lip effect, it really does seem to fill in my lips like the product description says. My lips are glossy and smooth, they look great! The staying power could be better I feel like it disappears kind of quickly but it‚Äôs not too terrible. I would probably reapply once or twice more while wearing this throughout the day. My only sort of complaint would be when I take the applicator out of the tube, some of the gloss always flings out and it grabs a little bit too much product for me. Over all I really like it though and I would definitely try out more shades!",erinn1214,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Worth a try,16 Mar 2024,Love this lip filler lip gloss. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not sticky like the other ones I‚Äôve tried and the product doesn‚Äôt come out of the tube every time I put the applicator back in the tube. Smells good and is also moisturizing. Give it a try.,vi145,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
So pretty and actually plumps!,16 Mar 2024,"Very easy to apply and a lot of product comes out so,be weary of that. I have the glassy finish and it‚Äôs beautiful and sort of smells like vanilla.

glassy lips,16 Mar 2024,"This might be my new favorite gloss! It's so shiny and glassy like. The scent is so good too like a fruity or coconut scent I can't tell.

Best gloss on the market currently!,16 Mar 2024,"I really loved this lipgloss! Its not sticky at all, it smells like vanilla but not too overpowering, I love the gloss on this ,its so pretty but my favorite part about this is how innovative it is! The way it doesnt set into your lip lines and instead makes it look like literal lip filler amazes me, price wise its comparable to alot of the glosses on sephora, its one of the more cheaper ones!",moniig222,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
non sticky and gorgeous,16 Mar 2024,"I like how shiny this product is on the lips! It also hasn‚Äôt felt noticeably sticky, which can be such an ick for lipgloss.

great,16 Mar 2024,. i absolutely love this lipgloss. it makes my lips look super plump and glossy and glassy and looks so good on its own and with lip liner. the applicator is great for preciseness and defining your lips,206amanda206,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,16 Mar 2024,"I love wearing lip gloss. I'm honestly not a big lipstick wearer but I love wearing a lip liner with a good gloss and this is honestly a good gloss. The promotional marketing for it is a little over the top granted, but the product itself is really nice. It is definitely a thicker gloss but it isn't sticky and the thicker texture allows it to be longer lasting then a lot of other glosses that I've tried. It has a very subtle vanilla scent but I hardly notice it so I think that even those who prefer unscented makeup won't be offended by this. I only have the clear version but I can honestly see myself picking up one of the other colors because it is a very comfortable formula that gives a gorgeous, glassy shine to the lips.  I also appreciate that while it it doesn't contain some of the typical (but painful) plumping ingredients that some glossrs have, it makes the lips look a little naturally fuller because of that high shine effect.  I'm happy to have it in my collection now and I would say it's worth checking out for anyone who's interested in trying out a new formula.",CookieGirl1,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Pretty Colors and Packaging,16 Mar 2024,"Its a great product overall. Pretty colors and packaging. I dont see how it fills lines and blurs though. Seems like any ordinary lip gloss.

,16 Mar 2024,"This lipgloss has high shine and is hydrating. It‚Äôs thicker than I expected nor has any tingle high giving that ‚Äúfaux filler‚Äù effect.

Must have lip gloss,16 Mar 2024,"picked up this Huda Beauty faux filler lip gloss, and it‚Äôs a great product. The consistency is thick and it goes on smooth on my lips. It‚Äôs long lasting with minimal touch up‚Äôs.  A great addition to my collection.",Elbiee,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Although it is not a lip plumper, I still feel that my lips look fuller when I wear it. The applicator is also very interesting and unique, which adds to the overall experience. I have found that I can use it as a topper with my favorite lipstick or just a lip pencil, making it really versatile.

Lush little gloss!,17 Mar 2024,"What a long lasting lipgloss! There‚Äôs absolutely no burn to this, it‚Äôs super hydrating, has a great scent. The only downside I have found is that it is sticky.

Shiny lip gloss,18 Mar 2024,"Introduction: I was excited to try the Huda Beauty FauxFilter Shiny Lip Gloss in clear. As a fan of clear glosses for their versatility, I was curious to see how this one would compare to others I‚Äôve tried.

Packaging: The packaging of the lip gloss is sleek and elegant. The clear tube allows you to see the gloss inside, and the applicator is easy to use for precise application.

Texture and Application: The texture of the lip gloss is smooth and lightweight. It glides on easily and evenly, leaving a glossy finish without feeling sticky or heavy on the lips.

Shine: The clear gloss provides a beautiful, high-shine finish that enhances the natural look of the lips. It reflects light beautifully, giving the lips a fuller appearance.

Longevity: While clear glosses typically don‚Äôt last as long as colored ones, I was impressed by how long this one stayed on my lips. It lasted several hours before needing a touch-up, even with eating and drinking.

Comfort and Wear: The lip gloss is very comfortable to wear. It feels hydrating on the lips and doesn‚Äôt dry them out like some glosses can. It also doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or tacky, which is a huge plus.

Scent and Taste: The lip gloss has a subtle sweet scent that is pleasant and not overpowering. It doesn‚Äôt have a noticeable taste, which I appreciate in a lip product.

Overall Impression: Overall, I‚Äôm really happy with the Huda Beauty FauxFilter Shiny Lip Gloss in clear. It provides a beautiful glossy finish, is comfortable to wear, and lasts a decent amount of time. It‚Äôs a great staple to have in my makeup collection.

S H I N Y,17 Mar 2024,"I have really loved this gloss, I have so much trouble finding a good long lasting gloss that isn‚Äôt annoying. This one is thick, hydrating and stays for hours. It isn‚Äôt overly tacky or sticky, but of course if your hair touches it you‚Äôll have to get it out. It‚Äôs extremely glossy, my lips are so shiny when I wear this which I also really appreciate. Lastly, it looks great with something under it or completely alone! The applicator is unique and easy to use and apply, it really picks up a lot of product but doesn‚Äôt apply too much.

Nice clear gloss!,18 Mar 2024,I received this product in the clear shade in exchange for an honest review! Such a lovely clear gloss that isn‚Äôt sticky but still has some body to it.

Super shiny,18 Mar 2024,"This gloss is soo shiny! I got fooled by the name at first and thought it would be a plumping gloss that burns your lips. It‚Äôs not a traditional plumping gloss at all, so there is no burning feeling! Instead, the formula makes your lips look plumper and fuller by smoothing over the lines. The lasting power is good for a gloss. I love the shape of the applicator, it makes the gloss so easy to apply. My one complaint is that the packaging is a little bulky.

Awesome,18 Mar 2024,"I like this faux filler shiny lip gloss since it makes my lips look smooth and hydrated. It doesn't have any tingly/plumping effect but since it seems to smooth out lines, lips tend to look smooth and plump. I have it in glassy - clear.",Chocolover311,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Texture lip gloss,18 Mar 2024,"This lip gloss is a clear texture, without any color, and it is very moisturizing and very shiny when applied to lips. Can effectively improve their complexion!

Amazing,18 Mar 2024,"I received something in exchange for this post I recently tried the Faux Filler shinny lip gloss by Huda Beauty and I have to say, I am absolutely in love with it! The formula is super smooth and not sticky at all, which is a major plus for me. The shine it gives my lips is just stunning, and it lasts for hours without needing to reapply. The shade Faux Filler is the perfect nude color for my skin tone, and I love how versatile it is. It looks great on its own for a natural, everyday look, but also pairs beautifully with a bold lip color for a more dramatic effect. Overall, I highly recommend this lip gloss to anyone looking for a high-quality, long-lasting gloss with a beautiful shine. Huda Beauty has definitely nailed it with this product!",Cavoriel,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Pretty,18 Mar 2024,This is a very pretty high shine lip gloss. I got it in the clear shade and usually apply it on top of a matte lipstick to give my lips some moisture. This lipgloss comes in a very pretty tube and smells like vanilla. I also really love the applicator!,akuzko,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,18 Mar 2024,"I can always count on huda beauty for good scents.

It's non sticky, lasts a while and seems to cure chapped lips while wearing",SaraL89,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Slightly hydrating and slightly sticky,18 Mar 2024,"This gloss is nice but nothing I would write home about. I tried the clear formula. Perhaps the colored formulas provide more of a punch. this gloss is semi hydrating, high shine, but a little sticky and overall it‚Äôs just not my favorite. One of the things that irritates me about the gloss is the amount of product in it. I just feel like these brands are getting stingy with the amount of product that they put in these new packages. This is around a third of the product that you get in the Summer Fridays butter balm. And I feel like that formula is more hydrating than this one is. This is a decent product, but nothing to get too excited about.",JamieBon,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Perfect,18 Mar 2024,"FAUX FILLER Extra Shine Lip Gloss delivers on its promise! Smooth, non-sticky, and oh-so-shiny, it‚Äôs my go-to for instantly fuller-looking lips.

Lackluster Experience,19 Mar 2024,"I recently tried out the Huda Beauty Faux Filler Shiny Lip Gloss in Glassy, the clear gloss variant. As someone who adores Huda's setting powders, concealer, lip contour 2.0, and color corrector, I was excited to give this gloss a try. Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations.

One of my main gripes with this product is the excessive amount of gloss the doefoot applicator picks up. It tends to make a mess and applies too much product, requiring me to carefully remove excess gloss before application. Additionally, I found that the gloss doesn't have the longevity I've come to expect from other glosses on the market.

Moreover, the texture of the gloss didn't quite live up to the fabulousness of recent Huda releases. It lacks the wow factor that I've experienced with other Huda products.

Despite my disappointment with the Faux Filler Shiny Lip Gloss, it won't deter me from trying out more Huda Beauty products in the future. While this gloss may be a miss, Huda's track record of delivering amazing products remains intact.",ocbchgal,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Goopy Lipgloss,22 Mar 2024,"This will definitely give you shiny lips, but they will also feel goopy and gross.

It's cute but a pass,22 Mar 2024,"I love a lot of Huda Beauty products but, this isn't one of my favorites. This product was gifted for review purposes. Sadly, I had really high expectations for this gloss. Since it claims to fill in fine lines and give lips a fuller appearance. I have small lips with lots of lines (totally normal) no filler, ever. After trying glassy (clear shade) on its own, and with lip products underneath. I've noticed that this formula is thick, settled into fine lines (less with product underneath but it still did it), is sticky, and not very long wearing. It comes off very easily. It is super shiny and looks cute but, it settles, and doesn't penetrate the lips. So it's all gone the moment I take a sip of water. For the price tag and all the cons I've encountered over the past two weeks. I wouldn't recommend it and won't be trying it in other colors. Friends of mine have had similar experiences.",alexandramm,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

"I could, I‚Äôd give this product a 3.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è",23 Mar 2024,"Shade: Glassy

After testing out this lip gloss for the past week or two, I do feel like HUDA Beauty‚Äôs FauxFiller Gloss formula is hydrating and comfortable. That being said, overall, it doesn‚Äôt feel super sticky, but taking the applicator out is somewhat messy and stringy. At first it feels a little on the sticky side, but once it warms up on your lips it seems to move into more of a thick, hydrating gloss that is comfortable on the lips. As for the ‚Äúfull‚Äù & ‚Äújuicy‚Äù lips claim, that‚Äôs up to personal opinion :) Oh & if you like sweet scents like vanilla and cake, you‚Äôd love the smell of this gloss (if not, it‚Äôs probably not for you).

,25 Mar 2024,"I love this lip gloss, it has a nice performance and I really like how it looks on my lips, the texture is a little bit thicker, but it does not feel uncomfortable to me. The packaging is pretty, sturdy, but probably the heaviness-thickness makes it come with less product than I expected, the picture was taken right away when I was unboxing it, it contains about 3/4 of product, which to me it makes it overprice.",irisrubi,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Must have Lippy in your purse!!!,25 Mar 2024,I really love lipglosses and this one (Glassy) was amazing!!! This application was smooth and was different than other lip applicators. It is a pointed but triangular applicator that helps with the side of your lips and helps to smoothly get across all your lips. There‚Äôs no need to go back for more and I really have big lips. It‚Äôs definitely not sticky and it smells amazing! Like a soft vanilla or something softly sweet like a cookie. It looks super cute and can be worn with just a lip liner. Would definitely recommend you get this for your purse!!,lceja,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Great,25 Mar 2024,This lipgloss is so pretty!! But I noticed that there isn‚Äôt much product for the price of what it is. I will be purchasing as a gift but they should give more product for what you‚Äôre paying. A little goes a long way,15lisaaaa,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Makes lips fuller,25 Mar 2024,One of my favorite lip products now. I got it in shade Glassy and I like to use it solo or over some matte lipstick. My lips really look plumper and fuller. And I like the smell so much! Want to try this gloss in other shades.,Lovesia,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
A little goes a long way,26 Mar 2024,"Purchased Bombshell & watched Huda‚Äôs IG video clip on how to use it.- if you apply too much, it does get goopy.

I can't put this in my bag anymore. otherwise the scent is pleasant, the overall product is nice but the packaging off",lmiri,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Not a thick gloss,25 Mar 2024,This gloss is really good. It does not give a sticky or thick feeling on the lips. The applicator is really nice. I got the shade glassy so can wear it on lips just like that or with just a lip liner too.,Mopa86,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Meh.,1 Apr 2024,"I know there's raving reviews here, but to me, this gloss is just okay. The packaging is cute, although it's kinda giving drug store. The doe foot makes application easy and the color (Honey) is nice. The smell is sickly sweet, reminds me of those very early Kylie Cosmetics glosses. The finish is definitely not glassy on me, either. More like a liquid lipstick with some shimmer. I'm glad that Sugar Baby was sold out so I didn't spend money on two of these. I won't be repurchasing.",torii95,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Huda Beauty Faux Filler Lip Glos,29 Mar 2024,"I was gifted this Huda Beauty Faux Filler Lip Gloss in exchange for my honest review. This is such a fun lip gloss. It's infused with vegan collagen which is great, establishes high shine for beautiful envious lips, and provides a blurring and smoothing effect that diminishes lip lines for smooth luscious lips every time. My favorite aspect with this gloss is that it isn't heavy, sticky, or tacky in the least bit. Requires an effortless application that is transfer resistant, completely comfortable, and helps keep healthy beautiful lips.",Blairbear1991,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Patchy and settles,28 Mar 2024,"Not an amazing lip gloss. The color is nice , but they‚Äôre are textured pieces in the lip gloss that cause my gloss to look extremely patchy.

Pretty good,27 Mar 2024,It‚Äôs one of the more glossy lip glosses out there and it‚Äôs not sticky. It stays glossy for a long time and pairs well with your favourite lip liners.

Yes shine!,27 Mar 2024,"Absolutely love this gloss. The scent is nice and light, coconut. The shine is blinding! The Dow foot applicator feels nice but it‚Äôs a little hard to pull out. The formula is thick but not sticky. I just wish there was more in the bottle.",treesamarie,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Not a revolutionary gloss,4 Apr 2024,These glosses smell and feel great but there are some inconsistencies between the shades where they were streaky.,momobear3274,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
The BEST lip gloss EVER,3 Apr 2024,This is hands down the BEST lip gloss I have ever used. I have used many many lip glosses but nothing compares! This completely makes my lips soft and I have chronic dry lips. I am OBSESSED! I have the clear and Bombshell. It is not sticky or anything! Do yourself a favor and buy this!!!!,Meg417,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Not what I was expecting,2 Apr 2024,Saw all the highly rated reviews and noticed it went out of stock multiple times. I figured I‚Äôd love it but there‚Äôs so much better out there‚Ä¶ some drugstore glosses even! I like the color pay off but overall the texture is a big no for me.

Overhyped,8 Apr 2024,"I actually bought this and I can‚Äôt wait to return it. All the positive reviews are from incentivized reviews. The truth is, this is nothing revolutionary.

After drinking, any shine is gone.",AnaBananAna,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Obsessed,8 Apr 2024,I love the amount of shine that the lipgloss gave me. What really sold me was the applicator. I can be so precise with my application because of the unqiue applicator. This is definitely a must have product.,EileenTiburcio,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Comfortable formula!,11 Apr 2024,"I have this gloss in Glassy from the 90s lippie set. I find the vanilla ice cream or birthday cake scent pretty strong, but I love how thick this gloss is! It is surprisingly not stringy. My lips are currently very dry (as you can see in the attached picture with the red spot on my lips), and this product does a great job at hiding the dry parts.

Always in my bag,14 Apr 2024,I love the color and the smell of this gloss! It looks really nice and shiny on the lips.

"Okay, but I would go with a dupe next time.",4 May 2024,"Pretty color, nice feel and not sticky. I gave it three stars though because it really performs very similarly to Maybelline lifter gloss.

Grittiness!,1 May 2024,"I actually like this lipgloss, it feels super nice, comfortable, isn‚Äôt too thick and has enough coverage to make my two toned lips an even tone.  My issue is that there is a grittiness to it. I can physically see a grainy substance on the side of the applicator as well and it gets all over my lips where I have to almost pick away at it to make this wearable. I only see one other review mentioning this issue so not sure what to make of this or if I should stop using it.",Senatorr,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Awesome Collection!,16 May 2024,"I was so excited for this launch because I love Huda lip stuff. At this point I collected all the colours, so while I'm reviewing clear, I really am speaking for all of them...they are really wonderful staple glosses. A range of flattering neutrals and a clear for any application. The options for looks are endless. I love the scent of the gloss, it is exactly like her liquid lipsticks, that yummy, tropical sweet coconut scent. The gloss fills lip lines and makes your lips appear so smooth, plump and full, without any pain of a traditional plumper. The applicator is a nice shape for distributing product evenly on the lips, but sometimes it does pick up a little too much! The gloss is awesome, multidimensional and wears very well on its own or paired with lip liners, lipsticks, liquids, etc. The only issue I have had is sometimes the gloss bunches where your lips touch and it gets goopy. I recommend being sparing when filling in the inner part of your lip. Otherwise, this is fantastic!!",mermaidplum,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Super glassy,15 May 2024,"I love this gloss. Particularly the glassy and posh shades,‚Äù. I get so many compliments when I wear them. You can see a reflection in your lips! Neither settle into lip lines and it‚Äôs long lasting. Will keep these in rotation!",PaigesPalettes,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

For just 2.50$ more you can get the Fenty Gloss with over DOUBLE the amount of product! gloss bombs are 28.50 for 9ml!  I love when gloss fills in my lip lines but most glosses do that ‚Ä¶.

the pigment separates :(,22 May 2024,"I was really excited to finally get the chance to try this product after it being sold out for so long only to be disappointed‚Ä¶ The pigment in the gloss separates and sits in my lip creases.

Of course it transfers, it's a gloss. However, after my coffee, it didn't smear over my lips and I still have a bit of colour left. I find the colour to match well the promo pictures. One important thing, yes I'm in love with it BUT it doesn't fill your lip lines like the glossier gloss or the lawless forget the filler.

Best lip gloss,16 Sep 2024,HUDA beauty products have been in my skincare routine for years now and really enjoy using them. I got the honey shade in this lip gloss and it‚Äôs the perfect shade for me. Love how easy is to apply it and it last for few hours. It‚Äôs not sticky which is very important to me and also keeps my lips super hydrated and soft. I would definitely try some other shade because I‚Äôm loving this product so much already. Highly recommend it if you‚Äôre looking for an amazing lip gloss.,alyna1234,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Amazing gloss!,16 Sep 2024,"The packaging and display of this lip gloss is beautiful! I absolutely love the smell of this lipgloss, it smells like a sweet vanilla. The shade ‚ÄúHoney‚Äù looks so great on my skin tone and the gloss is definitely non sticky.",DaeIman,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,16 Sep 2024,"The Faux Filler lip gloss is a lot more pigmented than I thought it would be, with the color coco being a really nice chocolate-y brown. It does definitely help smooth my lips to make them look fuller without actually enlarging them. I enjoy the very faint vanilla scent it has as well. The doe foot applicator is big and makes it easy to apply the gloss on the whole lip in one swipe. (for me at least) 

The only negative thing for me is that because it‚Äôs pigmented and because of its gloss consistency, it‚Äôs really easy for the color to be applied inconsistently and kind of splotchy. It takes a little work for it to be applied evenly on the lips. I‚Äôm definitely going to be using this as a topper for lipstick to make the lipstick color darker for the fall season.",kana418,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

It glides on effortlessly and doesn‚Äôt feel sticky. Despite being super shiny, it feels lightweight on the lips and doesn‚Äôt get uncomfortable even after a few hours. However, I did find that it doesn‚Äôt last long. The shine fades, but the slight tint remains. I usually have to reapply after a couple of hours, but I don‚Äôt mind because the result is worth it.

,17 Sep 2024,"The **Huda Beauty Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss** is designed to provide a glossy, voluminous look without the uncomfortable stickiness often associated with lip glosses. Here‚Äôs a detailed review:

### Key Features:
- **Formula:** The Faux Filler gloss is lightweight and hydrating, formulated to give lips a fuller, plump appearance. It's enriched with nourishing ingredients to keep the lips soft and smooth.
  
- **Shine:** It offers a high-shine, glass-like finish, which enhances the lips' natural beauty, making them appear fuller and more defined.

- **Non-Sticky Texture:** As advertised, the gloss is non-sticky, making it comfortable to wear throughout the day without that tacky feeling that some glosses can leave behind.

- **Pigmentation:** While it offers a shiny finish, the pigmentation is generally sheer, designed more for enhancing the natural lip color rather than providing intense color payoff. It works well on its own or layered over other lip products.

- **Plumping Effect:** Though it provides a visual ""faux filler"" look, the effect is subtle, more about creating an illusion of fullness rather than a tingling or active plumping sensation.

- **Longevity:** Like most lip glosses, the longevity is decent but may require reapplication after eating or drinking. The gloss wears off evenly, leaving the lips feeling soft.

### Overall Impression:

Absolutely perfect for a high shine natural look,17 Sep 2024,"For many years I have been an avid user of Huda foundations, concealers and face powers. This was my first foray into products not used for my base. I decided to try the lip gloss as I like to keep a very natural and subtle look for my daily makeup and I tend not to use lipsticks. The shade honey was exactly what I was looking for. It is a true nude and instead of calling attention to my lips because of strong color, it instead gives them a plump juicy appearance with the subtlest shimmery hint of color. I like to wear my hair down after summer is over and the fact that this has minimal stickiness or cling makes it perfect for fall. Lastly, this is only of the only glosses that doesn‚Äôt leave that dreaded line on my upper teeth and I think that is likely due to the viscosity and staying power.

Lovely,17 Sep 2024,"I'm absolutely loving the HUDA Beauty Faux Filter Foxy Lip Gloss! The formula is incredibly smooth and lightweight, making it perfect for everyday wear. The shade Foxy is a stunning, versatile neutral that complements my skin tone beautifully. The gloss has impressive staying power - it lasts for hours without fading or feathering. The texture is comfortable and non-sticky, and the scent is subtle and pleasant. My only reason for deducting a star is that the gloss can be a bit too shiny for my personal preference. However, this is easily remedied with a light dusting of powder. Overall, I highly recommend the HUDA Beauty Faux Filter Foxy Lip Gloss to anyone seeking a gorgeous, long-lasting gloss.

Nice but no plump,17 Sep 2024,So this is a nice gloss - I like that it‚Äôs more sheer - and not sticky. HOWEVER- this isn‚Äôt plumbing at all. With the name like faux filler I would have expected it to plump. And I like plumbing glosses - it‚Äôs a nice gloss but if you want plumping I would pass,SabrinaMarieTT,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Smells great and feels very moisturizing!,,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
High Shine Gloss,17 Sep 2024,I really liked the applicator of the lipgloss and how it first applied. I used the shade Coco to go over my lipliner to add more depth to my lip combo and it worked perfectly. When I tried to use it all over my lips it got a little streaky but nothing another layer or two couldn‚Äôt fix. I definitely think this is a really great gloss to trace your lipliners with though.,AshleeCook,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Very Shiny and Beautiful Bold Color,17 Sep 2024,I think the Huda Beauty lip color is just the right bold color for me I recieved the Foxy lip color. The Huda Beauty Faux Filler is light weight full of color and shine. I noticed the shine right away and my lips look even and fuller because the imperfections were blurred so doesn‚Äôt look chapped looks hydrated and soft and full and healthy!,tmille,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
A new favorite,17 Sep 2024,I‚Äôll start by assessing the main called out qualities here. For one the faux filler effect. This is in filler as in plumping through tingling but rather through hydration and a 3D shine effect. I think this does a great job at this. A lip liner can make it even more plump looking. On its own though it‚Äôs also good. The other main thing is non sticky and I also agree here. My hair wasn‚Äôt getting stuck in it even when it was pretty thickly applied. The shade Pout is a perfect darker brown shade that‚Äôs not too gray. The applicator is a little weird but I kind of like it. It comes to a point sloping on both sides. The gloss packaging feels high quality. The wear time isn‚Äôt anything spectacular. It‚Äôs on par with other lipglosses. This will definitely be one of my frequent glosses of choice.,rareblueberry,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
A fall staple,17 Sep 2024,"I received this lip gloss in the shade posh for my review. I love the doe foot applicator and how it‚Äôs more narrow at the tip for a more precise application. The packaging is very pretty and the formula is very smooth. The color posh reminds me a lot of the summer Fridays, brown sugar lip balm. It‚Äôs more of a browny mauve color. I honestly want to get another one because it‚Äôs just so beautiful.",AshleyEliasWood,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Gorgeous,17 Sep 2024,"I‚Äôm convinced that Huda can do no wrong! This lip gloss is everything I hoped it would be, it‚Äôs smooth, non-sticky, glossy, and has great pigmentation! It also has a really yummy scent to it! My lips are loving this.",falison75,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Want plumped lips without getting a filler?,17 Sep 2024,"I‚Äôve been trying out the Huda Beauty Faux Filler shinny non sticky Lip Gloss for a while now, and honestly, I‚Äôm impressed! The texture is super smooth and comfortable, not sticky at all, which is a big win for me. It gives my lips a nice plumped look without that annoying stinging feeling most lip glosses have. 
The shine is perfect, not overly glossy, but just enough to make my lips look fuller and more defined. Plus, it leaves my lips feeling so hydrated, which is great since I hate when glosses dry them out.

I constantly have to adjust my makeup whenever I wear lip gloss because they all seem to bleed off my lips a little and it ruins my foundation around my mouth. I put this lipgloss on before work and checked on it every break to find ZERO bleeding!! Not only did it stay where it was supposed it, it melted and set into every little crack on my lips, leaving them perfectly coated with the gloss. This one is so glossy it‚Äôs glass like and it looks so neat after a few minutes because it seeps into the tiny lines of your lips and settles in! I truly do see the lip filler effect! The wand on this is unique as well, you pull it out and it‚Äôs ready to use on both side of the shaped wand with the perfect amount of gloss ready to be used. The gloss lasted me several hours before I even needed to reapply a little bit. My biggest take away from it all is how soft it‚Äôs left my lips even after I‚Äôve gotten home, showered and done my skincare.

So pretty üíñ,18 Sep 2024,Love this lip gloss. You had me at Non-sticky! I tend not to wear lipgloss because of most being sticky. Not the case with this one and the shade sugar baby is top tier!

Good but drugstore has the same,18 Sep 2024,"Color foxy looks pinker than advertised. Other than the formula is really nice, not too sticky but long lasting.

A little sticky for me honestly,18 Sep 2024,"Huda Beauty fauxfiller in shade Coco ü•• this formula is a super hydrating & reflective finish gloss. unfortunately, this color does not complement my skin tone, but the glass finish is beautiful, regardless. The description on Sephora‚Äôs website says it is non-sticky, but it was sticky in my experience. Some of the positives I enjoyed about the product are - the large doe foot applicator, which holds an extreme amount of gloss and the fact that it is infused with vitamin E, vegan collagen, castor oil and is free of sulfates SLS and SLES. Some of the bad- the formula for me was a little messy. I have smaller lips so the doe foot applicator was a little intense with the amount of product that it held. when I first opened the gloss, it was sticky to the point of being chunky when the applicator was being pulled out of the component. overall, the packaging is beautiful. The texture is nice and the finish is a statement! It comes in 7 beautiful colors! I would love to try other in the future. Thank you Huda beauty",Samie1129,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

"Shockingly creamy, hydrating and NOT sticky",18 Sep 2024,"I was expecting this gloss to be sticky but it was ANYTHING but. To start, the packaging was gorgeous per usual with Huda. The larger doefoot was perfect for a smooth effortless application. The color in the tube EXACTLY matches the color after applying to your lips which is very rare. Lastly, the formula was shockingly creamy, hydrating, and NOT STICKY. The shine gave a plumping effect but there was nothing lost in the formula to do so. I‚Äôm big on lip wellness and this definitely changed the game.",StephKDe,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Fuller looking lips,18 Sep 2024,"As l age, my lips tend to feel drier and appear thinner. I love the look of the faux filler non sticky lip gloss be it moistens and colors my lips making them appear fuller and healthier.

"Glossy, Hydrating, Flawless!",18 Sep 2024,"I recently got the Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss - Posh Shades by Huda Beauty for my mom to try, and she‚Äôs been loving it! Her lips look fuller and smoother with a gorgeous glossy shine that she can‚Äôt stop raving about!

She mentioned that it feels super hydrating, thanks to the Vitamin E and Vegan Collagen, and it glides on smoothly without any stickiness ‚Äì a major plus for her. The doe foot applicator is easy to use, and she loves how it helps define her lips, especially around the Cupid‚Äôs bow. The shades are natural yet stunning, with just the right amount of color for an everyday polished look.

She‚Äôs really impressed with how comfortable and moisturizing the formula is, and it's now her go-to lip gloss for a quick touch of shine. She even asked me to get the other shades as a  gift for her next time as she fall in love with it. If you‚Äôre looking for a gloss that delivers on shine and comfort, this might be the perfect pick!

,18 Sep 2024,"Super creamy, smells amazing like a a sweet dessert, no weird chemical smell, packaging is clean, chic, modern and feels expensive, the applicator for the gloss is great for smaller lips and getting into corners . The shade coco is a chocolatey brown that is buildable, super shiny and glossy and non sticky. It doesn‚Äôt get dry or cause crumbs or a weird film on the lips as it wears on nor does it feather. Also it offers an instant plumping difference . The brown looks very rich and dark in the tube but surprisingly it is buildable and can be made sheer. It is also a wearable shade on all skin tones. It is definitely great to layer for lip combos with a lip liner or lipstick underneath or even on its own",Tima815,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
coco lip gloss,18 Sep 2024,"Faux Filler extra shine lip gloss. I received the color coco. It smells really nice and I like the packaging.

Gorgeous color and shine,18 Sep 2024,"I was absolutely not expecting to love this lip gloss as much as I do! It's not sticky at all, and the shade I got (Coco) is soooo gorgeous for fall. It's a very neutral brown that makes my teeth look whiter?? and gives me a very moody, autumnal look without being an aggressive dark lip.

Shade COCO,18 Sep 2024,"The Huda Beauty Faux Filler Lipgloss is an extra shine lip gloss that is long lasting and extremely pigmented. I chose the shade ‚ÄúCoco‚Äù which is going to be perfect for Fall in my opinion. If you enjoy scented makeup products, you may like this, it smells exactly like a sweet chocolate bar. I appreciate the fact that the applicator picks up enough product for one pass. I used this gloss without lip liner and the color was still defined and vibrant so it doesn‚Äôt require much effort to achieve a gorgeous look which is convenient. My only complaint is there seems to be some grainy texture in the gloss so I‚Äôm not sure if it was just mine. Other than that, I would recommend Huda Beauty‚Äôs Faux Filler to anyone looking for a new lipgloss.",Corinacxoxo,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Great non-sticky gloss!,18 Sep 2024,I have loved every Huda product I have tried and this lip gloss is just as fantastic! I am using the color Honey.

Lasts a long time,18 Sep 2024,"The Huda Beauty Faux Filler Shiny Lip Gloss in Coco is a game-changer! I was instantly drawn to the rich, deep brown tone that feels both edgy and elegant. When I applied it, the gloss glided on smoothly, and the shine was absolutely stunning without feeling sticky. The formula is lightweight but gives a plumping effect, making my lips look fuller and hydrated throughout the day.

What I love most is how versatile this shade is‚Äîit‚Äôs perfect for both day and night looks. Whether I'm pairing it with a bold eye or keeping it simple with just mascara, it always adds that perfect finishing touch. Plus, it lasts a good few hours without fading, and even when it does, it leaves a nice tint behind. Definitely one of my new go-to glosses!",Tarana,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Gorgeous Gloss,18 Sep 2024,"I love this lip gloss. I‚Äôve heard of the brand but this was the first time trying it. Product works as it says and helps with fine lines and the appearance of more volume. Product is sheer but the color payoff is wonderful. Colors aren‚Äôt necessarily true to the color on the box so trust the process. Gives a lovely glossy sheen and glitter like shimmer to your lips. Applicator and tube are designed well to be both compact and provide full coverage in one swipe. As with most glosses, it‚Äôs not going to last all day and will transfer to literally anything that touches your lip but it isn‚Äôt sticky. All in all a great gloss for this price point. Looking forward to trying to different colors.",MandiDS,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

"Great formula, meh color",18 Sep 2024,"I got my gloss in the shade Coco, the darkest brown shade. As an alt fair-skinned girl I was going to use it for my grungy everyday looks. While I love the shine and texture of this gloss, and I find the applicator to be doing a great job at coating my lips, the pigment in this gloss is quite uneven/patchy. In the picture, you see me wear this gloss (one sheer layer) paired up with a lip liner. I also did try to layer the gloss on to get better opacity, however it only amplified the patchiness - it's a good lipgloss for day when you don't have to do any talking lol. I will definitely be picking up the shade Glassy though - the formula is amazing, it's just the color distribution that bothers me :)",kseniyavoranava,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Love this lipgloss and the shade is perfect!,18 Sep 2024,"I was gifted this lipstick in exchange for my review. I got the shade foxy and I am really loving it so far.

Yes but different shade!,18 Sep 2024,"The lip gloss feels nice on! Buildable but not sticky which I appreciate.

Burning,18 Sep 2024,"I can‚Äôt believe I have to give this lip gloss a bad review. When I first tried it, it started to burn and I thought maybe it had glitter or something, my lips do not like glitter. I rubbed it on my hand and there‚Äôs nothing but gloss. I quickly rubbed it off and put on one of my other glosses.  I gave it a day and tried again and this time no burning until I rubbed my lips together. I have never experienced something like this and I have tried plenty of glosses from high end to drug store brands. I‚Äôm disappointed but you can‚Äôt win them all. 

I‚Äôm also not a fan of the suction. When you pull the applicator out, a lot of product comes out and unless you have massive lips, gloss is going right back into the tube. I have big, full lips and pulling the applicator out pulls out way too much product for me.",Sonotemo,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Love,18 Sep 2024,Loved it! Stays on your lips for a very long time! Definitely smudges but what lip gloss doesn‚Äôt! Once it dries it‚Äôs really not that sticky anymore and the color is very pigmented. I really like this and would buy,cequiteee,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

,18 Sep 2024,While I definitely didn't get a color that fits me properly I do love the formula. The gloss has a great smell to it as well as it's very pigmented. The applicator is unique and a little strange to use in the beginning but you get used to it. With the name faux filler I was worried there was going to be a lip plumping effect but I happily surprised to find no tingling sensation. Wiping off the gloss leaves my lips a little dry but I wasn't expecting my lips to feel hydrated after a gloss. Overall it's a very solid lipgloss that I recommend trying out!,SadieMcC68,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
So pigmented and pretty!,18 Sep 2024,"I was pleasantly surprised at how pigmented this was for a gloss. I got the shade ‚Äúcocoa‚Äù and you can definitely see the color on my lips.

Felt great on my lips,18 Sep 2024,"The Huda Beauty Faux Filler Lip Gloss was very hydrating and felt great on my lips. While I do not think it had the ‚Äúglass finish‚Äù it claims to have, I will agree that it is shiny. I like that you can pair it with different lip products to have a new look every day. I‚Äôm sure it would be long lasting if you did not touch it but it did not survive a small meal. It did not fill my fine lines as it claims it will, either.

Great For A Glam Look,19 Sep 2024,"I recently tried the Huda Beauty Faux Filler Extra Shine Lip Gloss, and I have mixed feelings. First off, the shine is incredible. If you‚Äôre looking for a high-gloss finish that catches the light perfectly, this product delivers. It gives a glass-like shine that really amps up your look, making lips appear fuller and plumper without the need for an actual lip plumper.

The texture, however, is a bit thicker than I expected. It‚Äôs not sticky, but it does feel slightly heavy on the lips, so if you‚Äôre used to lightweight glosses, this might take some getting used to. 

In terms of color, it‚Äôs sheer with a hint of tint depending on the shade you choose. I tried the shade ‚ÄúCoco‚Äù and it added a subtle, brown hue that‚Äôs perfect for everyday wear.

I think it‚Äôs worth trying, especially for that extra shine effect. This gloss is great for a glam look, but keep a compact nearby for touch-ups!",LunaNightingale,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

,20 Sep 2024,"I recently tried the Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss, and I have mixed feelings about it. First off, it‚Äôs incredibly glossy, giving my lips a nice shiny finish. The texture is also impressive‚Äîit truly is non-sticky, which makes it comfortable to wear without that tacky feeling some glosses can have.

The product has a light fragrance, which I found subtle, it‚Äôs not overwhelming, so even those sensitive to scents shouldn‚Äôt find it bothersome. However, one downside I noticed is that it didn‚Äôt seem to last very long. After a short time I needed to reapply.   As for hydration, I didn‚Äôt feel like it provided any significant moisture to my lips. It‚Äôs more of a shine booster than a lip treatment.

In summary, the Faux Filler Lip Gloss is great if you‚Äôre looking for a non-sticky, ultra-glossy finish, but it falls short in terms of longevity and hydration.",ARH5928,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Posh star!,20 Sep 2024,"First off, I love that this is non sticky. There is nothing worse than sticky or tacky lip gloss or that sticky feeling on your lips. This product went on so smooth, it honestly didn't feel like I had much on my lips. The color is pretty, it isn't super vivid, but I didn't want a super vivid color, so it works for me. It's more nude / natural which is what I was hoping for. It lasts a while on the lips too, over time it did start to come off and since it's not matte, it isn't transfer proof which is fine for me, as I like to know I can take off the lip color when I want to, without much effort. The product smells good too, I know it probably sounds petty but I hate when lip products stink! They're too close to my nose to smell bad! Overall, I'm very satisfied with this shiny gloss & I definitely will be purchasing over shades!",JESSJX101,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Cute nude,20 Sep 2024,"The glass is some thing that sits nicely on the lips and isn‚Äôt something that sticks together, which is very nice.

Color foxy,20 Sep 2024,"The color is very cute and red or burgundy that isn‚Äôt too bright or strong. This would be a good gloss for the fall.

Non-sticky gloss,20 Sep 2024,"Huda‚Äôs new gloss has a surprising texture! If gloss isn‚Äôt normally your thing because it‚Äôs sticky and gloopy, you will love this gloss!

I thought it would be a plumping and tingling gloss from the name but it isn‚Äôt. It has a light vanilla scent and glides over to smooth out every line in my lips. If you look for something hydrating, you‚Äôll enjoy this. If I had to say anything negative, it would be that the doe foot may have too much product on it right out of the tube for those with smaller lips. I have to scrape a little off on the tube so I don‚Äôt over apply.",kasadiaisbeauty,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Perfect non-sticky gloss with high shine,20 Sep 2024,I was a little skeptical of a lip gloss being non-sticky since that is all I‚Äôve ever known. But this formula is true to its name!!

,21 Sep 2024,"I was so excited to try Huda Beauty‚Äôs FauxFiller but was quickly disappointed. I do love the concept of it being able to be sheer to full opacity, and I do feel like that‚Äôs totally possible. It is not, however, possible to do without it getting extremely patchy. This may only be an issue for deeper colors (especially given that I have light skin and therefore less pigmented lips) but I hesitate to try other colors as well. I will say that the scent of this is a lovely coconut.

"Thick gloss, pretty color",21 Sep 2024,This packaging and color is so beautiful. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is how thick the formula is. However you can kind of sheer it out so it doesn‚Äôt feel so thick. The only issue with this is that you no longer get a lot of the color or pigment.,krcohen,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Thick & Juicy,21 Sep 2024,"Ok. I am definitely a lover of all things lips. Maybe even a little obsessed. So as soon as I received this, I had to try it immediately. 
First impressions: the gloss is thicker and definitely more pigmented than other glosses. It does seem to smooth out any fine lines and nourish the lips upon application.  But I wanted to try it a while longer bc thicker glosses tend to wipe off and can leave residue on everything. 
After more uses, I did ultimately decide that the gloss does all it claimed. It does leave residue on straws and so on, but that's normal. The color is stunning, and lasts a while! This is definitely one I would try in other shades!",IndyRan,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Great Lip Gloss,21 Sep 2024,"Lip gloss has become a staple in many beauty routines, offering not only color but also hydration for your lips. Whether it‚Äôs a high-shine finish or a subtle tint, finding the perfect formula can elevate your makeup game. 

I always consider factors such as texture, flavor, and longevity when choosing my go-to product. Some people prefer sticky formulas that provide long-lasting wear, while others opt for lightweight options that offer sheer coverage. 

I like high-shine, nonsticky formulas like this one from @hudabeauty in the Shade Posh.  Its plant-derived formula contains Vitamin E and Collagen to moisturize your lips while giving you beautiful color and shine. It's perfect for that lightweight hint of color that your looking for.

The finish is so glossy, it‚Äôs almost distracting in the best way. My lips looked instantly fuller without any of the tingling you‚Äôd expect from a plumping gloss.

Faux Filler,23 Sep 2024,I received my Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss from Skeepers in return for my honest review.  At first sight it was packaged in a sleek black box making the product look very luxurious. As I opened the package I pulled out a beautiful clear almost glass like container that you could be the color of the product through. My first thought was that this looks like a really nice lip product. Once I twisted the cap opened I found out it comes  with my favorite Reservoir Doe foot applicator which allows the product to hug the lips and almost function as a liner as well. I really love the texture of this lip gloss. It has a glass like finish with the perfect amount of color pay off. It‚Äôs extremely hydrating and long lasting.

Foxy lips indeed,23 Sep 2024,"I received something in exchange for this post. Faux filler you say?! The name was intriguing insinuating that it‚Äôll give me a ‚Äúlip filler‚Äù look. I like a plumped looking lip from time to time. Foxy looks like my kind of color so that‚Äôs what I went for. I had exfoliated my lips and moisturizer them the night before. First off, the packaging is simple and sleek. Then there‚Äôs the applicator, it‚Äôs quite unique and different than the normal doe foot applicator. I pulled it out of the tube and it already has so much product on the applicator! I tried it on as is and wow, I was impressed off the bat. There wasn‚Äôt a super sticky feel to your lips but a more of a hydration feel to it. The scent to me smelled of vanilla and mocha which was fine. You do not need a lot of product to start with as a little does go a long way. It gave me full coverage the first swipe without having to dip the applicator in for more product. I wore it for several hours and had a big lunch. My husband notice and complimented that the lip color is still on after all the eating we did. It wasn‚Äôt full coverage but a tint was left over. I reapplied again and it stayed on until I got home many hours later. It didn‚Äôt dry out my lips, it gave it a fuller lip look, no stickiness, the color Foxy was perfect, and I didn‚Äôt have to reapply often. I‚Äôm definitely going to grab other colors as this is going with my other fall lippies.",MrsPeachyBoba,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

I love the color,23 Sep 2024,"Since I picked up the Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss in the shade Bombshell by Huda Beauty, it has truly been a game changer in my makeup routine. The first time I applied it, I was blown away by the color: a stunning bright rosy nude that perfectly enhances my lips, giving them a healthy and radiant look. It‚Äôs that perfect shade that feels just right for both everyday wear and special occasions.

One of the things I love most is the gloss's finish. It‚Äôs shiny, but not overly so; instead, it adds a luminous effect that makes my lips look irresistible. I adore how it reflects light, giving them a plump and juicy appearance‚Äîalmost like I have model-worthy lips!

In terms of texture, I have to highlight that it‚Äôs completely non-sticky, which is such a relief. I‚Äôve tried other glosses that feel like you‚Äôve slathered glue on your lips, but this one glides on smoothly and feels lightweight. I can wear it for hours without that uncomfortable sensation.

The longevity is also impressive. Even though it‚Äôs a gloss, the color holds up remarkably well for several hours. I‚Äôve been in meetings, eating, and even sipping coffee, and I still see that beautiful hue on my lips. The formula seems designed to last longer than typical glosses, which is something I genuinely appreciate.",mar11sv,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Just okay,23 Sep 2024,"This is okay. It smells delicious, like chocolate, it‚Äôs really glossy, but not sticky which is nice. Only issue I have is that the color doesn‚Äôt apply evenly, which is kind of weird because it is just a gloss, but there is very clear borders. It almost looks like you‚Äôre wearing lip liner. The dark color may work better on darker skin tones. It‚Äôs a beautiful color, but because of its uneven application it looks poor on my fair skin.",ashleyoc,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Great color,23 Sep 2024,"This color was absolutely perfect. It was also the perfect amount of moisture and shine at the same time.

,23 Sep 2024,a little disappointed with this lip gloss - wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a good lip gloss but it‚Äôs not as advertised - it feels sticky and tacky to me in consistency. Almost feels more like a matte lip than a shiny lip gloss!,erinandso,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

,24 Sep 2024,"### Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss Review

I recently tried the Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss, and I‚Äôm excited to share my thoughts! I received this product in exchange for this post, but my review is completely honest.

First off, the shine is absolutely stunning! It gives my lips a luscious, plump appearance without feeling heavy or sticky, which is often a concern with glosses. The non-sticky formula is a game changer‚ÄîI can apply it and go about my day without worrying about my hair getting caught in it.

The applicator is easy to use and allows for precise application, which I really appreciate. It glides on smoothly and feels incredibly comfortable on the lips. Plus, the color payoff is impressive; it adds just the right amount of tint for a natural look.

Overall, I‚Äôd recommend the Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss to anyone looking for a high-shine gloss that feels great and looks even better. If you‚Äôre like me and prefer glosses that don‚Äôt stick, this one is definitely worth trying!",vml7,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Juicy lips,25 Sep 2024,"I am so excited to finally get to try this Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky lip gloss by Huda Beauty. First detail I noticed was the simple yet stylish packaging. I like that you are able to see the true color and how much product is left.
The gloss itself is unique. When I applied the lip gloss it really did reflect it's name because my lips were shiny and not sticky. With this gloss what I was most impressed with was the fact that it smoothed out my lips and made them plumper. This is without any of the usual minty tingles the typical lip plumpers out there have. Even after the long lasting gloss wore off, my lips still felt soft and hydrated. I can't wait to grab this in more shades.",beautybyrhema,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,25 Sep 2024,"I really love this lipgloss, it doesn‚Äôt feel too thick but it has decent color payoff. Not sticky like it claims and it wears really well over most of my lipliners. The applicator is super precise so you can touch up without a mirror very easily",KellySay,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

,25 Sep 2024,"I would give this product overall a good 4.5/5. Claims are high shine, blurring, and smoothing effect. The formula feels smooth on the lips. There is a pretty shine that is just the right amount without looking too awkwardly glossy! Not sure about the blurring because I do still see the natural lines on my lips, but I still feel like my lips do look nice with the product on. This isn't the type of product where you feel like there's nothing on the lips. With that being said, it's not heavy but you can feel something on the lips without it being goopy/sticky, which is nice. I really like the applicator shape. I didn't apply lip balm prior to see if this product is nourishing enough. The product is not drying per se, but im not getting full hydration. I would say $19 is not too bad for high end brand, so I would recommend this product and would like to explore more shades to the line.",SammyJG,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Obsessed,25 Sep 2024,This is such a good gloss!! I hate lip glosses that become gross after wearing for a while but this one doesn‚Äôt do that at all. It‚Äôs not sticky and melts into your lips after wearing for some time. I really love the tint to it too!,exploringbeauty,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Great!!!,25 Sep 2024,"As someone who is sensitive to ‚Äústicky‚Äù glosses, I was impressed with this product! The formula is buttery smooth, & gorgeous on the lips :) Definitely worth the splurge for a quality gloss! The color was also the perfect amount of pigment",Hannah5220,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
High shine & hydrating!,25 Sep 2024,"I‚Äôm loving the Huda Faux Filler Lip Gloss!  High shine, hydrating & good color payoff. I‚Äôm wearing the shade Honey here. It‚Äôs not my ideal shade, but I enjoy this formula & applicator so much, I would definitely purchase in another shade better suited for my skin tone. The glossy shine really does give a ‚Äúfaux filler‚Äù effect!  Love that the applicator is pointed at the top too. Both things set it apart from other glosses out right now.",reviewsbyhughes,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Great for those looking to get into gloss!,25 Sep 2024,"I really enjoyed this lip gloss - and that is coming from someone who typically would choose a balm over a gloss any day. The color honey is super flattering and natural, isn't thick and sticky, and when applied made my lips just look really naturally glossy and slightly tinted. I also found this lip gloss to be hydrating, not leaving my lips feeling dry as the product faded over the next few hours. I would absolutely recommend this lip gloss to those who prefer a lip balm and want to dip their toe into more glosses.",lojovb,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Love this gloss,25 Sep 2024,This lipgloss is so smooth and pigmented! I got the darkest color so a little bit definitely goes a long way! So cute for a chocolate lip moment. Love the packaging and the formula as well. Favorite fall lipgloss!,Mirandaaflores,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
HIGHLY recommend!,25 Sep 2024,"I absolutely LOVE this lipgloss! It really IS NON-sticky. It really DOES blur fine lines, and wrinkles. It really DOESN‚ÄôT have that weird tingly feeling that other lip plumping products have, AND it really IS extremely shiny. It is NOT edible, but it smells SO good, that you‚Äôll think about it. I got it in COCO, and it REALLY DOES show up AS that color. You can either put on a thin layer for a slight tint, or put it on like normal for its‚Äô true color! It‚Äôs filled with so many great ingredients, that even AFTER it wears off, your lips feel SO soft. I‚Äôm going to try putting it on before bed, and use it as a lip mask. It‚Äôs WONDERFUL, and I really can‚Äôt think of one negative thing to say about it. DEFINITELY worth the price!",stacface7822,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,25 Sep 2024,I absolutely love the new Huda Beauty Faux Filler lip glosses. Each color is so unique and look amazing on the lips. It hydrates and keeps it plump for a long time. I will definitely keep buying the other colors.,MelodiT,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
I love it,25 Sep 2024,"I am a huge fan of lip glosses and this is literally my favorite lip gloss. I feel like it adds a decent amount of volume, you don‚Äôt have to reapply it a lot. I love the nude color, it looks great on my lips. I feel like it‚Äôs a color that goes well with any skin tone. Sometimes nudes make me look washed out because they literally blend into my face color but this one doesn‚Äôt do that at all. It‚Äôs so pretty. And there‚Äôs nothing better. I highly recommend buying a couple. Keep one in your makeup bag and one in your purse to apply but you won‚Äôt NEED to constantly reapply if you‚Äôre drinking, eating, etc. I like to ‚Äúgloss‚Äù my lips with this product around the edges and all over and let it sit for a couple minutes and then rub it in really well, let it sit a little longer and then wipe off the excess. I feel like this helps plump up your lips. I already have pretty full lips naturally so I don't need much, but I definitely feel like this helps give me that extra boost I need.",Yele0206,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
hydrating!,25 Sep 2024,"such an amazing lipgloss! it is not sticky and the colors actually shows. it leaves the prettiest tint. i also found it lightweight and not too sticky or thick, it kind of applies like a thick oil. also well hydrating",Aysha1998,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
A new lip staple!,25 Sep 2024,"I love this gloss in the shade Posh! It‚Äôs a smooth formula and isn‚Äôt sticky. I love the soft pigment of the gloss, and the fact that I can use it as an everyday shade. I also love the fact that I don‚Äôt have to keep reapplying!",saanviseth,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
loved the product,25 Sep 2024,"I am absolutely in love with the Huda Beauty Faux Filler Gloss! üíÑ This product is a game changer for anyone looking for that perfect pout with a glass-like shine. The formula is non-sticky, super hydrating, and gives my lips a plumped-up, fuller look without feeling heavy. I‚Äôve tried many glosses, but this one stands out for its comfortable wear and the way it makes my lips feel soft and moisturized for hours.

What I adore the most is the rich pigmentation‚Äîit‚Äôs the perfect balance between a lip gloss and a lip tint. Whether I‚Äôm going for a natural day look or a bold night out, this gloss adds just the right amount of shine and color. Plus, it smells divine!

The applicator is precise, making it easy to apply on the go. Overall, I would highly recommend the Faux Filler Gloss to anyone who wants that perfect glossy finish with a touch of luxury. Huda Beauty has nailed it with this one! üíã‚ú®

ƒπove it but could use some improvements,25 Sep 2024,A lovely lip gloss! I love the packaging and the brush. It is a big brush with somewhat of a triangle shape. Pick up a lot of products and quite pigmented despite being a gloss. Doesn't have much of a scent but maybe some candy hinting here and there. I would say it's a bit sticky tho. Some other brand I've tried definitely left a gloss finish but not sticky. Hope there will be improvements.,pjsaBb,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

great fall gloss,25 Sep 2024,"I have this in the shade Coco which is a really pretty neutral brown shade. I have fair skin and the deepness of the color isn‚Äôt overwhelming on me at all! It‚Äôs very wearable, especially for fall makeup looks or that 90s brown lip look. The scent of the product is veeery sweet, sort of like frosting. The doe foot applicator is interesting in that it is triangular in shape with a very pointed top. I found it does help make application more controlled, especially for deep shades like this where you really want to be precise on the edges. The formula is thick, but not sticky at ALL, and leaves an intense shine. I can see what they mean by blurring effect on lip lines. Like they‚Äôre not invisible, but definitely smoothed out. I‚Äôm not sure about the other shades, but this one in particular you I‚Äôll definitely need a mirror when applying; I found that the product sort of layers itself in a way that needs some extra effort to blend in or else you‚Äôll be left with some patchiness.",daniraaa,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

,26 Sep 2024,"The Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss in Coco is a great option if you're looking for a comfortable, glossy finish without the stickiness typically associated with lip glosses. The shade Coco is a lovely warm brown with a subtle shimmer that enhances the lips, giving them a plump, shiny look. It feels lightweight and moisturizing, leaving your lips soft even after it fades. However, like most glosses, it doesn't last very long, requiring frequent daily reapplication. The pigmentation is on the sheer side, offering a more natural look rather than a bold, opaque finish. Overall, it's a versatile, hydrating gloss perfect for everyday wear, though it could benefit from longer staying power.",davaynacamalot,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

I got the deeper brown shade and it is actually a taaaad bit patchy to spread on my lips and I have to spread it out with my fingers. Theirs also not much of a line-filling or plumping effect which is what the name of the product implies. With that being said, it‚Äôs still a beautiful gloss that stays put on my lips all day and is 100% not sticky at all. I‚Äôve implemented it into my daily routine :)",rlphie3366,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

I keep all of my other lip stuff in my purse, but I work remotely so that means most of those aren‚Äôt worn much. This is hydrating and ever so slightly shiny. And it stays on for several hours.

Warm brownish red,26 Sep 2024,"Received Huda Beauty Extra Shine Lip Gloss in the shade Foxy as a gift. It is a perfect dry rose color for Autumn. Although the official description mentions a hint of peach tones, when swatched and spread on my hand, it leans more towards a brownish-red tone. A thin layer gives a sheer, translucent look, while a thicker application creates a fuller, more saturated color with a glass-like effect. It has a sweet, honey-like scent, and the texture is slightly sticky and leave stain on cups. The gloss does offer a subtle plumping effect without the uncomfortable tingling sensation some lip plumpers have.",chloegong,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

New gloss must have,26 Sep 2024,"This Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss from HUDA Beauty is a new favorite for me! I got the coco color which is a gorgeous deep brown shade. Lip glosses can be hit or miss for me but I love that this formula is non-sticky as that is a turn off for me.  It has a glass like glossy shine to it with just the right amount of pigment. This gloss can be used alone, over a lipstick, or with lip liner depending on the look you want. I love that it‚Äôs made with vitamin e and collagen so that it‚Äôs moisturizing.

Non Sticky Gloss,26 Sep 2024,"I‚Äôm a gloss girlie through and through but I also don‚Äôt like all glosses. The Faux Filler Lipgloss is soo good. The shine lasts a while and is actually noticeable. My lips look larger as the gloss draws focus. And this gloss isn‚Äôt sticky or dries out your lips because it has Vitamin E. If you want color, long lasting shine and fuller looking lips, try this gloss.",aycaaaaa,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
very hydrating,26 Sep 2024,"I really like this huda beauty lipgloss! I got it in the shade of posh and it‚Äôs a very neutral color! Every time I grab for this lip gloss, I use a little dark lip liner, and it gives me the perfect fall shade!",barshas0,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,26 Sep 2024,"The color ‚ÄúHoney‚Äù is the perfect nude shade for me. All the shades (except clear) definitely have noticeable color on them. The formula is semi-thick. So kind of between lip oil/gloss and a creamy lipstick? I do like these a lot, the smell is very sweet though so if you aren‚Äôt a fan of that, now you know! :)",IrinaOwen,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Love it,26 Sep 2024,I really love the new Huda Beauty Lip Gloss. I got so much compliments from my friends and it gives this nice glow to the lips. The formula is not so sticky at all which I love. I prefer to apply lip tint before the lip gloss because the color of the lip gloss is not as strong as I thought.,janneitte,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
A must have lipgloss for a plump look!,26 Sep 2024,"Ok ladies! This gloss is a must have!! I don‚Äôt have any lip filler and have naturally wrinkled lips, with this gloss your lips will look smooth and plump! Absolutely obsessed with the color, the consistency, and the feel. Not sticky at all!",carolb23,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Perfect for medium/tan skin tones,27 Sep 2024,Posh is perfect for medium/tan skin tones. It doesn‚Äôt stand out too much (not too unnatural). It smells and feels nice on the lips (no tingling). It‚Äôs really shiny and makes the lips look good and doesn‚Äôt emphasize lip wrinkles. However I‚Äôm not sure that I noticed my lips looking plumper.,Shreyakarissa,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Really like this product,27 Sep 2024,"I honestly really love this product. The color is definitely too dark for me to wear alone all the time by itself however I don‚Äôt mind that so much because I just mix and layer it with other lip products. I use it to make my rosy shades a beautiful rosy brown. The gloss itself is very thick which I really like. It is not sticky at all either. I can sheer this dark color out to work for my tan skin alone and can use it to create a vampy fall look. Overall I really love this product. The packaging is heavy, feels luxurious and is very chic. Also there is a lot of product in the packaging which makes it a great value in my opinion. The gloss seems to plump my lips without the tingling or burning feeling which I really appreciate. Also the thick, soft fluffy large triangle shaped applicator makes application easy. A lot of product is on the large applicator which suits my personal preferences because I like when I can use a lot of product at once compared to have to keep dipping into the packaging. The only caveat to this is that product placement can become slightly uneven due to the large amount of product that is on the applicator. Also the smell is heavenly like cocoa powder/hot chocolate.",rachlynne09,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Great shine!,27 Sep 2024,"I really enjoy this gloss formula. It‚Äôs very shiny and pigmented‚ÄîI have the shade Foxy. It‚Äôs such a great shade for fall.

I‚Äôd probably get this in clear though.",nostalgiakills,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Loving this lipgloss!,27 Sep 2024,"I am really loving this lipgloss. I wanted to try out a gloss that doesn‚Äôt darken my lips too much, and I think I found the perfect one. The color isn‚Äôt over powering, it is subtle in the perfect way. Plus my lips have a plump and glossy glow. I‚Äôd recommend this product for sure!",kelsey9203,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,27 Sep 2024,I love this gloss so much. Not sticky at all and very easy to use. I will say that it is a little stringy like honey when I pull the doefoot applicator out of the tube so I have to be careful not to get the product everywhere and I have to wipe off the excess each time. But quality product. Can‚Äôt go wrong with any of the colors. Clear is my fav tho.,ninaggg,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,27 Sep 2024,"I recently tried the Faux Filler Non-Sticky Lip Gloss from NYX in the shade *Coco*, and I‚Äôm absolutely in love! The color is a beautiful, rich brown that complements a wide range of skin tones, making it perfect for both everyday wear and more glam looks. It has a glossy finish that adds a touch of sophistication without being over the top. What I love most is the formula‚Äîit‚Äôs truly non-sticky, which is a huge win for me. I can wear it comfortably throughout the day without that tacky feeling some glosses leave behind. Plus, it feels super lightweight on my lips, while still giving them a plumped, hydrated appearance. The Faux Filler name fits perfectly because it creates the illusion of fuller lips without the need for heavy products. Overall, this gloss has quickly become a staple in my makeup routine. If you‚Äôre looking for a non-sticky, high-shine gloss with a luxurious feel, the NYX Faux Filler in *Coco* is a must-try!",mikituka,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Must have,27 Sep 2024,This lipgloss fits my skin tone so well. It reminds me of the Fenty chocolit. It goes on so smooth and it‚Äôs not sticky and doesn‚Äôt give you the white stuff around your lips. I‚Äôm in love with this lipgloss,QLewis,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Nostalgic!,27 Sep 2024,"So far I really like this gloss. It has a very shiny, nonsticky formula. It feels so nourishing and hydrating. It really does blur the lines of your lips! They were definitely less noticeable when I wore this. The applicator is nice as well. It has a thick, flathead foot that makes it easy to apply to the lips. One of my favorite things about this gloss is actually the scent. I can't put my finger on what it is, but it has a very nostalgic scent. It reminds me of my favorite glosses from the 2000s that I absolutely adored. I got the shade 'Coco' and it is a very cute neutral brown shade. It reminds me of hot chocolate. The first layer gives you a light wash of the color but you can build it for a more intense color. The only downside for me is that the formula was quite grainy and I'm not sure why. You can see tiny grains of something on the applicator. I can also feel the grains on my lips. Fortunately, after the gloss is on my lips for a couple of minutes, the grainy texture goes away. I don't know if I just happened to get a bad batch but I hope the texture will be improved in the future. Though it goes away, it's still not a great feeling on the lips.",stellareviews10,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

However; I was pleasantly surprised!! There is pigment but not too much, looks great with a brown liner. Its just like most glosses when it comes to stickiness (not to be confused with a lip oil).

Formula is good and not too heavy on the lips!,27 Sep 2024,"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I like that this lip gloss has a big applicator and it brings out a lot of product. The color didn't suit me much so I would have to wear it on top of another lip product instead and also a lip liner would be ideal. The formula is non-sticky, not too heavy on the lips, and glides easily on my dry lips and it also makes my lips look plumped. It's really glossy too and I'm not bothered by the subtle smell. I hope they release more colors in the future. It doesn't feel warm on the lips too.",Roselinni,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Not my favorite.,27 Sep 2024,"Honestly this gloss isn‚Äôt my favorite formula. I‚Äôve tried it on multiple occasions and I find it to be extremely sticky on me, it feels like my lips are glued together. On top of the stickiness, the formula isn‚Äôt very long lasting at all and is too thick for me.

Love this lipgloss!,27 Sep 2024,"I have always been a fan of Huda beauty products and I really like this lip gloss too! I would have given this a five star review but I just wasn‚Äôt happy with the shade.

Not my favorite,29 Sep 2024,"To start with the positive, this gloss actually is non-sticky. The color payoff is good for a gloss. However, I found it went on kind of patchy and it was not very easy to even out the color. The glossiness is nice, but beyond that I didn't notice any plumping effect. I tried the brown shade and it just did not suit me either. Given that it was ""just ok"" over all, I don't think I'll try another shade.",KBinCLE,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,29 Sep 2024,"I was gifted in exchange for this post, This lipgloss color is gorgeous and works well for all kinds of skin tone, so i was really happy about that but the only issue with it was it was a bit patchy on the lips and i definitely had to work around that aspect.",nelimariee,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

A new must use lip gloss,29 Sep 2024,"This lip gloss has proven it name and is better than I thought it would be. It is not sticky at all, and when using a straw it doesnt smear off. The color is perfect against my skin tone and is more a neutral maroon color. The only drawback to this lip gloss I noticed is that it seems to a bit drying so I can‚Äôt wear it everyday because the feel is kind of chalky once ‚Äúdry‚Äù",dnizzle08,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Love the texture!,29 Sep 2024,I received this Huda Beauty lipgloss in exchange for my honest review. First impressions the packaging is really cute. Very thick high quality packaging. The texture of the gloss is slippery and I love it. The shade Foxy is perfect for Fall. The scent is vanilla/cocoa My only critique is that the applicator picks up too much product which I feel is wasteful. I tried wiping some off on the top of the bottle which was messy. I have to blot my lips and remove a tad bit of gloss.,AnneWhitney,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Total Game Changer,30 Sep 2024,"I love the look of lip gloss, but it's so hard to find one that works for me because I do not like that typical sticky feeling on my lips that you get with most glosses. However, the Huda Beauty Faux Filler in the color Posh has been a game changer for me. The color is perfect, and the best part is that there is no stickiness. It feels and looks so smooth on my lips and makes them appear much more full, without the tingly feeling.  Even my fiance complimented me saying it was his favorite lip color I've worn, and he rarely pays attention to things like that. It also lasted surprisingly long for a lip gloss. It was still shiny after a drink, and my lips still had a nice color minus the shine after a meal, which I don't typically see in most lip glosses. I'd say without food or drinks, I can normally get 3 hours of shine before having to reapply. I'm very happy I found this product and recommend it to anyone who does not like the typical sticky feeling that comes with lip glosses.",aprilsxtn,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

My opinion,30 Sep 2024,I got this product for free but I am giving my honest opinion it has a little hint of chocolate scent to it. Fist impression packaging I like it very chic. It feels very soft on the lip it looks brown like a light brow but definitely see the color. It really nurseries if I could say my lips they feel soft and look very juicy it gives a gloss to it while making your lips look soft. It transfers as expected with all glosses but I had a stick texture when not on the lip.

The color is much more nude/tan than I guessed but it‚Äôs not brown so it still looked decent on my light/medium skin.

Non sticky and pigmented!,30 Sep 2024,"I am a gloss connoisseur, and this lipgoss did not disappoint! The packaging shows the color perfectly and the doefoot applicator grabs a good amount of product without needing to redip. The scent is vanilla/cupcake, very sweet but not overpowering. As far as application, the gloss is pigmented and adds a great shine to the lips without being sticky or heavy feeling. I will say my main point would be to make sure you exfoliate your lips for the lighter shades because it will cling to your dry patches and look blotchy and uneven. Other than that I love the gloss, and have loved using it on top of other lip products or even on its own with just a lip liner. Really impressed and has been my new go to gloss.",bbyruthhh,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or greasy, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like a thick layer that is moving around on the lips. I love the applicator, very easy to use.

,30 Sep 2024,"After receiving it, it immediately became my most used lipstick recently. This is a nude lip glaze that can definitely improve your complexion and is not picky about your skin, right? ! I would like to call it almond cold tea brown. The pink brown, red tone, and brown tone are just right. Matte and not dry, cold and elegant. Thin application is very daily and very suitable for plain water makeup. Light lips/white skin, go for it‚ùóÔ∏è Thick application and deepening of brown tone will give a more ""earth-eating"" color feeling. All skin colors can hold it and are very suitable for light European and American makeup. I prefer thin application and can be used for work and commuting. Super versatile. The comprehensive ability of the lip glaze is excellent in all aspectsüëç 1Ô∏è‚É£Good comfort on the lipsüëå Not sticky, not dry, and no film feeling. 2Ô∏è‚É£Good color rendering.

Moisturizing and not sticky!,1 Oct 2024,Love it!! I love that it‚Äôs not sticky at all and it‚Äôs hydrating! Looks really nice over lipstick also but I just use it alone for a normal clean day look. I love all Huda products and this is gonna be a daily favorite from now on!,jubeelee,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Love the shade!!,1 Oct 2024,I love the lip color it‚Äôs a beautiful brown purple color on me and it leaves my lips feeling smooth and plumped. The downside is it‚Äôs sticky on the lips so I would recommend putting a little bit. Also the smell is nostalgic it‚Äôs a good smell that doesn‚Äôt annoy you.,lizo2,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,1 Oct 2024,"I love HUDA products but not a big fan of this one. I‚Äôm not sure if it was the shade I ordered, but found this to be streaky and inconsistent with the coverage. The formula is not my favorite and I think overall I wouldn‚Äôt be willing to purchase again.",ABK47,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,1 Oct 2024,"I love this lipstick, and the color, is perfect, not too dark. glows beautifully. I'm a big fan of lipsticks, I don't like too dark colors,  and this one is just perfect, the color, and the shine and smells great.",mcamilaca19,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
I like,1 Oct 2024,"This lip gloss was a gift from Huda Beauty and I am very happy to try it. I really liked the texture it has, the shine it leaves on your lips, how pigmented the color is, it is beautiful, a soft but long-lasting color. I like the size of the container, how easy it is to apply and how pretty it leaves your makeup, it leaves your lips well moisturized and shiny.",irene0409,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Glossy,1 Oct 2024,I truly enjoyed this lip gloss because it is actually not sticky and has pigment to the lips. I think it is a beautiful shade for fall. I live that the glossy formula stays put not all day but it is pretty resistant even after eating.,iamyeesi5,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
So pretty!,1 Oct 2024,"I recently tried the Huda Beauty Faux Filter Lip Gloss, and I‚Äôm absolutely in love with it! The first thing I noticed was the insane shine ‚Äì it really does give your lips that glassy, reflective finish that makes them look plump and juicy. I was a little worried it might feel sticky, but it‚Äôs surprisingly comfortable. The texture is smooth, and it glides on effortlessly without any tackiness. The formula is super hydrating, thanks to the Vitamin E and Vegan Collagen. My lips felt soft and moisturized even after hours of wear. I also appreciate that it blurs fine lines and gives a fuller look without that annoying tingling sensation that some plumping glosses have. It‚Äôs more like a lip filler effect but in the most natural way possible. I‚Äôve been using the shade Bombshell, a beautiful nude, and it complements my skin tone perfectly. The applicator is also worth mentioning ‚Äì the doe foot with the reservoir makes it easy to get just the right amount of product for maximum shine. If you're looking for a gloss that‚Äôs comfortable, hydrating, and gives your lips a high-shine, fuller look, this is definitely the one to try!",owneokdnifbfh,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Great shade!,1 Oct 2024,"Very comfortable on the lips, and I like the selection of shades. The shade ‚ÄúHoney‚Äù is nice for my not super pigmented lips when all I want is to add some subtle definition, shine, and tone (like a ‚Äúmy lips bit better‚Äù kind of thing). For my preferences I have to carefully wipe the excess off the applicator before putting it on my lips because it‚Äôs easy to apply too much. A thin layer feels and looks great! (A thick layer starts to look milky.) I love how it disguises the lines in my lips and makes them look softer.",KieraJoYo,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
A must have lip gloss!!,1 Oct 2024,I absolutely love this lip gloss! I love that it isn‚Äôt sticky when you put it on and it feels very soft on the lips. It also makes your lips look absolutely stunning! This is one of my new favorite glosses!,johannamillerrr,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Must try.!,1 Oct 2024,Huda faux filler non stick lip gloss. Is my absolute favorite for this fall time. The gloss is very glossy but also hydrating for my lips. It has a natural finish when adding lipliner under it makes the perfect every day lip combo.,soylagg,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Nice but not my favorite!,1 Oct 2024,"I normally love Huda Beauty, but this gloss didn‚Äôt do it for me. The color payoff is really nice, and even just one swipe gives enough color to be all you need. It is definitely shiny, too! It is not, however, very non-sticky. I still felt like the gloss was a little thick, probably to give that plumping effect, and my hair still stuck in it when riding with the windows down. It‚Äôs lipgloss, so a little of that is to be expected, but to advertise it as non-sticky wasn‚Äôt 100% accurate. Overall a nice gloss, would still use for the color, but it just won‚Äôt be my favorite one!",nikkimdarling,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Perfect Gloss,1 Oct 2024,I am absolutely in love with the Faux Filler Shiny Non-Stick Lip Gloss. I got it in the shade honey and it is the perfect light pink nude color for fall. It‚Äôs smooth and is definitely not sticky like other lip glosses.,MalloryChambo,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Best lipgloss,1 Oct 2024,"I love the lip Gloss, my lips are always dry and this gave it the extra hydration it needed. I have the COCO color. It made my lips extra shiny. I can‚Äôt wait to wear it on date nights or to the club because it looks so soft and succulent on my lips. One of the best lipglosses I have ever used. I know for sure this would wear lovely with a brown lipliner or lipstick",prettyeyestasia,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Such a good gloss,1 Oct 2024,I received this lip gloss in the shade coco. I was worried it would be too dark since I'm fair but it is the perfect brown shade. It is not very opaque. Not sticky at all and very lightweight. I I really like the applicator as well,shayyron,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Must have in my routine.,1 Oct 2024,I am a lippie person and I have to try them all to keep my lips feeling soft and smooth and of course hydrated.  This is one on the top of my must have list. It's smooth to apply. Is lightweight as I can't handle anything too heavy so it's perfect that way. My lips feel hydrated and the colors are stunning. Love this so I highly recommend!,SandraLynn3,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,1 Oct 2024,This lip gloss goes on as smooth as butter. The texture has the perfect amount of slip but it‚Äôs still thick enough to grip onto the lips. The color payoff is amazing. I really like this gloss overall.,happiihippii,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Comfy on the lips!,1 Oct 2024,"This has become my go to lip product! I love how comfortable it is in the lips, also very hydrating but my favorite part is how full and smooth my lips look after applying.

Good color range,1 Oct 2024,"I like this gloss and I like the shade but it is so hard to pull out of the tube, it makes me reach for it less. But I do like the shades, I own two and I like using them to top off any lip liner. They just have really good undertones!",YessAZ,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
So so good!!,1 Oct 2024,"I recently tried this in the color Foxy, and I am obsessed!! The pigment, the shine, everything!! It isn‚Äôt sticky at all, and makes my lips look absolutely amazing!! It is a top fav of mine now!! Also the packaging is SO cute!! Love it!!",Mnmomma21,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,1 Oct 2024,This is the third shade I got of this lipgloss. I find this formula to be nonsticky and pretty opaque so it looks very nice on its own or layered over lipstick. I also love the scent. They don‚Äôt really plump but I do love them for not feeling thick or sticky on my lips.,aishasiddiqui,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Can get patchy if you‚Ä¶,1 Oct 2024,"Not tacky, but she is thick; think a balmy-gloss. This is a tiny bit patchy if I‚Äôm being honest. Overall I will say I like this gloss, but it does look a little patchy for me. Not sure if it‚Äôs the darker shades specifically or if they are all like that, but if you apply one even layer you can avoid it looking uneven in tone. The more you add, the more obvious it is. I like this gloss & especially for fall, with a lip liner & over top - perfect fall pout. The price isn‚Äôt bad either! The only not-so-great thing I have to say is just about the patchiness. Otherwise I like! (gifted in exchange for honest review)",AEllyB,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
The perfect brown lip gloss,1 Oct 2024,"I love the scent, the thickness of the gloss and the extra shine it gives. I pair it with some brown lip liner and it is perfect for my skin tone. It smells like chocolate but the scent is not overbearing. I would definitely repurchase.",TotallyMicka,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,1 Oct 2024,"I have enjoyed using this gloss, but it‚Äôs not a super smooth gloss. It‚Äôs kind of gritty. But it does last really well on the lips and isn‚Äôt sticky. The chocolate color is beautiful and goes really well with a dark lip.",Sammmm111,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Just okay,1 Oct 2024,"I received this Huda Faux Filler Shiny lip gloss as a gift in exchange for my honest review. First off, it smells so good and glides on well. I love the color and the shine it gives. I do however feel like it is a bit on the sticky side even though it says non sticky. It lasted quite a while but it wasn't a comfortable wear for me. I did like the product but not enough to wear it daily.",lucyrm86,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,1 Oct 2024,This gloss is so perfect for fall! I love the shade so much. I also love the formula. It‚Äôs perfect! It‚Äôs not sticky at all and super shiny! also lasts long on me. I also love the packaging. What I don‚Äôt see is the ‚Äúfaux filler‚Äù.,miriesp,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Thick Gloss,1 Oct 2024,"This gloss has great pigment! I love the color of it, it is super glossy as well! I do like that it feels hydrating! It does wear off like other glosses.

Feels like a lip balm!,1 Oct 2024,"I got the faux filler shiny lip gloss in the shade cocoa and love her! Often times I feel like brown shades are too light or red for my complexion and this one was perfect. I agree that this isn‚Äôt a sticky formula. This almost feels like a lip balm. It is shiny but I don‚Äôt feel like the shine lasts super long, again it‚Äôs reminds me of a lip balm with the hydration and shine it has. The scent is a light vanilla and it‚Äôs smells EXACTLY like the fenty butta drop body butter in vanilla. The application is pointed and stiff which I was surprised to see but really enjoyed. It made he‚Äôs really easy to apply with precision. All in all, I really liked this gloss and it‚Äôs definitely Black girl friendly",Brittney97,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

,1 Oct 2024,"Shade is pretty opaque and there‚Äôs a nice shine to the product. The packaging is minimalist and easy to store, though slightly bulky so might be annoying to take out with you if you have a micro bag. Definitely would recommended having a smooth base before applying because this will catch on to everything!",Eloquency,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Loved it!,1 Oct 2024,I love this! The color is gorgeous and the formula feels great on my lips. It also smells so good and tastes good too! The only thing I don't love is how the doe foot applicator is so big that it's hard to be precise with it.,Heathercuellar,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
"Great application, decent formula",1 Oct 2024,This lip gloss has a really nice non sticky texture. Its not overly shiny either. The applicator is awesome because it have a pointed tip for precision and also feels like it has a curve to kind of hug the lips. The shade coco is definitely meant for deeper skin tones to wear alone but I think on top of a pink nude lipstick this is still wearable for fair skin tones like mine,Jenn100495,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
"A little sticky, but pretty",1 Oct 2024,"This lip gloss has super vibrant and lasting color, however has a stickiness that makes it difficult to apply evenly onto your lips. It's definitely better as a top coat over a lip color given it's stickiness.",Tiakozar,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,1 Oct 2024,"My new favorite lip gloss! I have long hair so a sticky lipgloss and I do not get along and this one is perfect.

Blindingly Beautiful Shine,1 Oct 2024,"I love the look of lip gloss. What I usually don't love is the sticky feel. That was not a problem with The Faux Filler Extra Shine Lip Gloss!
The gloss was not sticky, in fact it was a bit refreshing and soothing feeling. 
The high shine of the gloss combined with the precise applicator afforded a beautiful look that enhanced my lips and made them look fuller. 
I was actually complimented on  the shine and color twice when I wore it to run errands!

While I wish it lasted longer, the gloss remained for hours with no creasing or drying of the lips. In fact, my lips remained soft and supple feeling for the entire day.
¬†
A few things that make this gloss unique is that there are ingredients like vitamin E and vegan collagen to target moisturizing the lips.
The doe foot applicator is designed to hold the maximum amount of formula for that glossy look effect. In addition, the tip of the applicator makes precision an ease. 

Overall, I found this to be an intensely shiny, light feeling, moisturizing and highly flattering lip gloss!",Ananael,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,1 Oct 2024,"This is fun! It gives a beautiful gloss but your hair doesn‚Äôt get stuck in it haha, I wouldn‚Äôt say its 100% not sticky but is definitely better than most. Colors are fun as well! This is great to throw in your bag",jackjill3,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Non sticky,1 Oct 2024,Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss in the shade Sugar Baby (light pink) is a beautiful everyday lip gloss and works well as a lipstick topper too.

Love it!,1 Oct 2024,This is such a great product to add to your makeup routine. The color is just enough to add some pop but is not overbearing. It is not overly sticky either as is the case with a lot of glosses. I have also had no issues with the color running or losing vibrancy throughout the day. I can't wait to get this in a few more colors.,victoria2118,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

,1 Oct 2024,"I really like the gloss so far. But the only thing is that if you have any sort of dryness on your lips, it will be super super visible with the lipgloss on top of it. I think if you have super soft lips will work perfectly, but if you have any crack, it might not look the way you want to.",Trib3cca,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Pretty color and not sticky!,1 Oct 2024,"This lip gloss looks rich and creamy on your lips, and it also stays put very well. I was worried it would be sticky, but it isn‚Äôt. The nude color I chose looks nice on my skin tone. However, I wouldn‚Äôt say that this has any sort of plumping affect on me, so the faux filler part didn‚Äôt hold true when I wore it.",Carolinecjl,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,1 Oct 2024,"I like the color. I love the applicator and I do like the fact that it is so gloss that it diminishes the appearance of lip lines. However, I'm not a huge fan of the smell. I will also so that it's not completely sticky but it's not smooth either.",krisrocks615,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

,1 Oct 2024,I was gifted this Faux Filter Shiny Lip Gloss by Huda Beauty for my honest review. The honey shade is very natural and perfect for autumn daily look! It helps hydrating the lips and they looked fuller and juicy after a few usage. It lasts long and my lips felt very conformable. I will definite recommend it to friends.,JoDoe,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Wish the color lasted longer,1 Oct 2024,"I really like the overall effect of this gloss. Mine is the shade ‚Äúposh‚Äù. It‚Äôs described as a deep rose but I think it leans more berry than rose. It‚Äôs gorgeous and would be really flattering on pretty much anyone. It‚Äôs not opaque but not super sheer either. My lips look glossy and smooth. My only complaint is the color fades kind of quickly - like within an hour or so. My lips continue to look glossy and feel really nice, but I wish the color lasted a little longer at this price point. A lip liner underneath does help with color longevity a bit. (I received this product from Huda Beauty in exchange for review.)",RebeccaP43,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,1 Oct 2024,"This gloss is now one of new favorites of all time, the color is absolutely beautiful and natural looking on my skin tone. My favorite thing about it is how it‚Äôs not heavy and overly sticky. It‚Äôs the perfect formula for a gloss.",kimberlyshariss,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Super opaque and juicy!,1 Oct 2024,"If you‚Äôre looking for a juicy, non-sticky gloss with a big color payoff, this is for you! I got the shade ‚Äúposh‚Äù and even though I prefer my glosses to be an easy sheer wash of color, I still love how this wears! Definitely something you‚Äôll have to wear lipliner with because it‚Äôs so pigmented, but you can definitely skip the lipstick if you wanted to. It doesn‚Äôt look like it in the tube, but ‚Äúposh‚Äù is the perfect cool tone mauve. It also smells really yummy! I was expecting this to be tingly because I thought the faux filler name would mean lip plumper, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily plump. Just fills in all my cracks and fine lines for a smooth lip. I really like this gloss and will buy the clear version next!",itskimbroly,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Not so hot,1 Oct 2024,"I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I did some research checking out all the glowing reviews on it and I just can‚Äôt relate to them. The gloss smells good enough to eat just like hot cocoa. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just that specific color ( aptly named cocoa) but it‚Äôs yummy either way. This is a gloss that feels sticky like most of them. It also transfers easily and doesn‚Äôt last long at all so you‚Äôll be doing a lot of touch ups though out the day. I wanted to like this I really did , however this is my opinion so maybe your experiences will be better than mine. Don‚Äôt let me stop you from doing your thing.",sweetsarah1986,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Moisturizing Gloss,1 Oct 2024,This gloss was super moisturizing and the perfect pigmentation. It wasn‚Äôt too opaque or sheer and let just enough of your natural lip shine though.

My new favorite lip color!,2 Oct 2024,"The Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss is a standout product for anyone looking for a high-shine lip gloss that feels comfortable on the lips. Unlike many glosses that can feel sticky or heavy, this one delivers a lightweight, non-tacky finish that makes wearing it all day easy. The gloss offers a brilliant shine, giving lips a plumped, fuller appearance without the need for any actual lip fillers, which is a huge plus for those who prefer a more natural approach.

Its smooth texture glides on effortlessly, and it has impressive staying power for a gloss. You might need a touch-up after eating, but it generally holds up well throughout the day. The variety of shades available is another bonus, catering to different skin tones and preferences, from neutral nudes to bolder, more vibrant hues.

The formula feels moisturizing and doesn‚Äôt dry out the lips, which is often a problem with glosses that focus on shine. It also works well layered over lipstick for added dimension or on its own for a simpler, polished look. If you‚Äôre in the market for a gloss that combines shine, comfort, and a fuller-lip effect, the Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss is definitely worth trying.",southernmelons,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Plump Lips w/No Lip Creasing!,3 Oct 2024,"This year I turn 40 and I am fighting fine lines like my life depends on it.  Everything I own either lifts this or plumps that while other things suck the rest in.  It's only natural that I was drawn to the Faux Filler lip gloss.  The slight tingle isn't overpowering and only lasts a short while.  Normally I will shy away from anything ""gloss"" because it will only end up feeling tacky and making me feel nasty.  Faux Filler is the exact opposite and stays smooth as long as I choose to wear it.  Highly recommend for anyone who wants fuller lips, or, if you are like me, and want the best of both worlds: fuller lips with non lip lines.  Basically, like having my cake and eating it too!",lesleyann03,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Gritty texture? I see it in others pics too‚Ä¶,3 Oct 2024,"Was hoping to really love this, the formula is a little thick, it is glossy but I feel like the pigment doesn‚Äôt go on that smooth, I should try another layer to see if it‚Äôll be more opaque, it feels rather sheer on, and splotchy in some areas. One thing I noticed when I first opened the gloss was a gritty texture on the stick part of the wand, so I ended up searching it on my hand and my lips next, it had some sort of a grit to it not sure what that is, or if it wasn‚Äôt fully mixed together in production.. 
not my favorite lipgloss but it‚Äôs okay.",MarEAhn,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

It has the ability to go on thicker and have more pigment without feeling very sticky or like I have a lot of product.

I recommend and plan to try other colors.",Smader1,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Beautiful color!,3 Oct 2024,"I love a high quality lip gloss! I used Huda Beauty's ""Posh"" shade Faux Filler Shiny Non-Sticky Lip Gloss and was pleasantly surprised at the appearance.

"Settles in lines, patchy",3 Oct 2024,"I am a lip gloss girl through and through but this one was a huge disappointment.  The only positive is that it isn't sticky which is a big plus but it doesn't make up for the rest of the issues.  Firstly, the pigment is high but patchy so it looks sloppy and cheap.  The pale pink shade would be lovely if it were more of a sheer wash rather than so intensely milky.  It seems as though all the pigment settles into every line on your lips and the shiny gloss base lacquers over the settled pigment and makes the lips look awful.  It's supposed to be ""faux-filler"" but it didn't make my lips look any bigger than any other basic gloss. Add to that the fact that the formula emphasizes every line on your lips (which you probably have if you don't have filler) and it's a recipe for disaster.",ItsLP,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,3 Oct 2024,"I really like this lip gloss! It‚Äôs not sticky at all, feels more like a balm. I like the applicator and packaging as well. The pinky brown shade is a great every day lip color. I would buy more shades.",MascarAHHH,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

The lightweight, non sticky texture glides on effortlessly, while the proprietary Lip plumper work to smooth out fine lines and hydrate my lips.

,3 Oct 2024,"Not my favorite lip gloss. The color is nice,but it‚Äôs very streaky on the lips. Gloopy and you can actually feel like it on the lips too. Not for dry and chapped lips, but can be applied very sheerly on top of another shade.",DorinaM,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

However, the gloss feels a bit too heavy on the lips, and the application could be smoother, as the formula is a little tricky to work with. Overall, it‚Äôs a beautiful product with room for improvement in texture.",yuliiaivaniv,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
So beautiful!,4 Oct 2024,"I absolutely love this faux filler lip gloss from Huda beauty. It's beautiful, non sticky, gives a nice fullness to my lips and has a great rich color. It just feels so good and lush with beautiful color payoff.",niomih,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,4 Oct 2024,I never really thought I‚Äôd be wowed by a lipgloss but this is it. It‚Äôs glossy without being sticky. It isn‚Äôt marketed as plumping but I find it really gives me volume. And it actually lasts which is weird because even matte lips don‚Äôt always last on me. This shade is perfect on my NC42 skintone. I can‚Äôt wait to try more of them.,Juicesnberriez,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
Too pinkkk,4 Oct 2024,"While it felt it moisturizing and the color lasted a great minute, unfortunately, the color that I chose was too light for my medium skin tone.

Great high pigmented gloss,5 Oct 2024,"I love Huda Beauty's products. I have used her Baking powder so I was excited to try her new lip products. What really caught my attention was the shade range. I tested the shade, coco and it is beautiful! Coco shows up as a neutral brown on my skin tone (Mac NC42). I paired it with my Natasha Denona lip liner in the shade, Luna.

Posh,8 Oct 2024,"Hudabeauty Fauxfiller in color posh smells really good. I don't believe this shade is a good color for me though as you can't even see the color on my lips, it just looks like I have clear lip gloss on.

Not the fall color I imagined,15 Oct 2024,"I got a darker color hoping it would be a good fall color but with light medium skin tone, it looked terrible on me.

really pretty but a little sticky,7 Nov 2024,"honestly, for $19 this gloss is incredible! I've been wearing it nearly every day for the past few months and there are only 3 things that I can complain about. The scent isn't great, it doesn't smell bad, but I feel like it could smell a lot better. its supposedly ""non-sticky"" lip gloss, but it is a little sticky. Not awful, but you can definitely tell you have something on your lips. And it will last a few hours at most with no drinking or eating. The color is GOREGOUS though! I'm giving this 4 stars bc there's a lot more good i could say about this gloss than bad. I would totally recommend!",ryanjoleigh002,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

"Super glassy gloss, comfy, pigmented, smoothing!!",2 Nov 2024,"Bn so long since something was worth writing a review for‚Ä¶
TLDR:
-Smoothing, pigmented 
-Show up beautifully on naturally pigmented lips like Indian/Desi skin tones 
-Super smoothing‚Äîwhat I expected but didn‚Äôt get from Charlotte Tilbury Plump-Gasm Plumper/Gloss
SOOOOO PERFECTLY PRICED!!!! 
For Reference: I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs, Sephora ‚Äújunkie‚Äù‚Äîhave tried many, MANY glosses and products in general, Medium Indian Skintone (Estee DW shades Honey Beige/Henna) 
Long version: 
Shades: Honey, Bombshell (love Huda Liquid Lip in by same name) & Foxy
I‚Äôm stunned at how smoothing and opaque these glosses are‚Äîon my lips which are NOT naturally pink. Usually‚Äîeven the prettiest pink glosses fail to show up on Indian/Desi skin tones bc of our naturally pigmented lips. These show up. Just had an entire cup of tea (from a glass cup which usu makes lip color come off quicker) and the gloss is still on. At this price, esp during Rouge Sale‚Äîit‚Äôs a no brainer. Since I did same-day delivery‚ÄîI was able to try the 3 colors I ordered this morning. Now about to order 2 more shades‚Äîsince I know they actually show up in color and not just glassy gloss (which would also be ok since these are so comfortable and smooth, but the color pay off is a bonus).",sephoraloves,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

"Beautiful colour and shine, no lasting power",11 Nov 2024,"The colour is beautiful and the formula starts off great, not sticky and high shine. Where it fails is staying power. I‚Äôm one of those people that can go the entire day not needing to reapply lipstick/gloss, so less than impressed this only lasted 3 hours before it needed to be topped up.",rrand,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
This is a no if you have fine lines.,10 Nov 2024,"This formula is horrible. I got the color sugar baby hoping for good results, but this formula is sticky, it just does not feel good on the lips. If you have fine lines, it will go right into them and have you looking crazy crazy crazy. I really wanted to like this, but had a return ",DorothyKM,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
I‚Äôll pass on this on the future.,10 Nov 2024,"I‚Äôm not impressed. Lip gloss feels nice but not very pigmented . Moreover, reminds of Fenty Hot Choclit the original. Not a lot of product for the price. Fenty or Dior is better.",Missnewnew32,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

the glitter glosses damage the lips,13 Nov 2024,the grit from the glitter in this shade cut into my lips. my bottom lip burns right now similar to what a cuts feel like.

"Not exceptional, hard to distribute.",12 Nov 2024,It is a cute gloss but if you have average sized lips it will be hard to evenly distribute the product while still maintaining the opacity of it because it just packs a lot of the product in the applicator. I just dont see the applicator as practical as the traditional ones but perhaps it‚Äôll make sense for someone who has big lips or those who have filler.  This color in particular will settle into fine lines but I didn‚Äôt notice it enough for it to bother me much. If you‚Äôre looking for this particular color I‚Äôd recommend the ABH lipgloss in Cotton Candy. Really only got this gloss for the color but I prefer the abh over this one.,spongeboobae,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Grainy & Goopy Lipgloss,22 Dec 2024,I have been consistently using this product and have officially come to terms that this gloss is disgusting. The reason I say this is because it is impossible not to have it gloop up and get stringy  when I talk. It also gets extremely gritty after like 5 minutes of wearing it.

Love this formula,29 Dec 2024,"Love this formula! Wears like an oil, and it really is non-sticky. I think Sugar Baby must be too close to my natural lip shade because there's really no color payoff for me, but I'll definitely try it in other shades!",the1truesupreme,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

"Definitely a new favorite for a clean, simple look",27 Dec 2024,"LOVE. This gloss goes on sheer with just a hint of natural pink that doesn‚Äôt settle into fine lines. It lasts quite a while‚Äî even after a few glasses of champagne. The slight shimmer of this shade is by no means overwhelming, making it a new staple in my lip routine. My one critique is that like most lipglosses worth their salt, it is a little bit sticky, but not nearly as tacky as other brands I‚Äôve tried.",kyleenrose,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
too much can be a bad thing,27 Dec 2024,"trending lip gloss I‚Äôve been dying to try - and I‚Äôm just meh. I was expecting to be wowed by this product, but I think it‚Äôs just okay.

Thin and liquefied,27 Dec 2024,"I wish I could understand all of the good reviews on this. I will say that I like a lot of Huda items. I purchased this gloss a few times to give it multiple chances. I was looking for a nudish color lip gloss to replace a discontinued Smash box gloss that I wore for years. The color is pretty spot on and I do like that but the Huda gloss is too thin and liquid. EVERY single time I put on, someone tells me I have something on my teeth. It‚Äôs very embarrassing. I also feel this runs out faster than other glosses.",skysmom42,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Not a fan,31 Dec 2024,"Being that I never had faith in huda I  decided, let me at least try the lip gloss. I‚Äôm a lipgloss girl. It‚Äôs the worst it‚Äôs not nourishing or moisturizing and the most disturbing was it sank into every line on my lips. Lines i didn‚Äôt even know where there, it was disgusting.

,13 Jan 2025,"Con: Completely clear without a hint of color for me, and this is not the normal for me with lip glosses. I have slightly pigmented lips, but I can see color in sheer glosses. This shows up as essentially no color. So the people in the pics who have a pretty frosted pink sheer gloss must already have some other product on that's supplying the color. This should be disclosed. I thought I was getting a sheer electric lilac pink gloss, not a plain clear gloss.
Pros: Texture is good, glossiness is perfect, and it smells nice- like vanilla cake. I like the large doe foot applicator. If you are in search of a clear gloss that is cool leaning, then I would recommend, but not if you want it to be pinkish.",djfashow,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

My lip‚Äôs natural color is darker than this pink so the pink color is almost insignificant. I like to use this gloss on top of lipliner or just alone if I want the glossy, plump, filled look. The gloss does not feel sticky and the doe applicator applies a generous amount on the lips to create a shiny, fully-glossed look.",jliang82,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
,13 Jan 2025,"This lipgloss smells great. It's very sweet, glossy, and reminds me of an ube drink. It also reminds me a lot of the frosty lip glosses that were available in the early aughts. The color isn't very pigmented, so I recommend wearing a lip color underneath.",apeachyday,Huda Beauty,Lip,No
"STRINGY, PLASTIC GOOP",13 Jan 2025,"One of the WORST lipglosses I have ever tried. The way this gloss performs, it should cost $5 at the drugstore. It has a very strong, synthetic plastic scent and flavor. Not sure why all of Huda's products have these cloying, juvenile scents. And it's not just this product, but her powder and liquid blush too. I prefer glosses that smell and taste good. I'd rather pay more for Tom Ford and Dior.",misslola,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Very Moisturizing Gloss,14 Jan 2025,"This gloss is nice and thick and feels very moisturizing. It‚Äôs slightly too thick for my liking as I feel like it gathers around the edges of my lips a bit. Additionally, the color is a very pale pink whereas I was expecting something a little more purple. Either way, the color is still pretty but looks a bit white on my lips since the pink color is so pale. This gloss does a good job of smoothing out lines in my lips however.",evenstevens13,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

Silky Smooth Formula,7 Mar 2024,"From the moment I applied it, I was enamored by its clear, hydrating formula. The gloss contains vegan collagen, which works wonders in smoothing and blurring my lip lines. Unlike many other glosses on the market, it doesn't feel sticky or tacky on the lips. Instead, it melts effortlessly onto my lips, leaving behind a 'glass-like' finish that is simply stunning. This makes it perfect for both everyday wear by itself or as a lip topper.

Moreover, it comes with a generously sized doe foot that picks up just the right amount of product. The innovative reservoir design ensures that you get the maximum formula with each application. This means you can achieve instantly glossy lips without having to constantly dip back into the tube. I can‚Äôt wait to try the other shades!",lilacfaeri,Huda Beauty,Lip,No

The glossiest gloss,7 Mar 2024,"I am not a big plumping gloss person, I love the effect but not the painful feeling ‚Äî luckily the Faux Filler gloss doesn‚Äôt hurt to use.
