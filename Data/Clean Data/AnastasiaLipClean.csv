"I was looking for a lil stain that would compliment my olive skin and have staying power. I was using Nars and decided switch. I absolutely love the colour and matte finish!

I actually LOVE THIS FORMULA I‚Äôm only taking one star off bc for my skin tone I can never find a nude shade that I love and pure Hollywood in the old formula was my perfect shade (not too bright not too muted perfect neutral but this pure Hollywood is a lot darker I think the formula does make them go on darker. This formula is so good tho!!! Original formula pure Hollywood on right and new on left,19 Dec 2024,Love but pure Hollywood shade isn‚Äôt the same,cansan1980,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I LOVE the velvet liquid lipsticks, but i‚Äôm so frustrated with the color looking one way in the bottle/ in pictures and when i try it on, it‚Äôs not that color at all.

"I was excited to get this and even got 3 colors right away, I am disappointed though. It‚Äôs thick, heavy and does not last, gets on my teeth and anything else that comes close to my mouth and needs constant reapplication. It even manages to take off the lip liner with it..",9 Dec 2024,Not long lasting,Bethbun,Anastasia,Lip,No
I like the texture and consistency of this formula. It‚Äôs a whipped creamy formula that applies easily. Does not feel dry or crack on the lips. It‚Äôs more moisturizing than the original formula. I swatched most of the nude shades.,7 Dec 2024,ABH Lip Velvet Liquid Lipstick,julliette88,Anastasia,Lip,No

When I put it on immediately my lips started to tingle, then my lips began to swell in four spots and even looked like it blistered. I have never had a reaction to cosmetics but I think I‚Äôm allergic to something in here",25 Nov 2024,Allergic Reaction.,urka27,Anastasia,Lip,No
For a brown girl this is very light makes your lips look grey. It goes on very smooth but does not stay at all. As soon I took a sip from a straw the entire lipstick was gone!! I‚Äôm returning this it‚Äôs not worth it,24 Nov 2024,Way too light/not worth it,Hina2407,Anastasia,Lip,No
"Pro-buttery-soft-non drying -a little goes along way

Con-idk if i like it on me
I know my skin tone (fair w/rosy(pink) cool clear winter (i happen to be a light winter) which is unique 

this doesn‚Äôt look bad but not the most flattering it‚Äôs on the boarder of universal but I‚Äôm thinking warm toned wether (spring clear)or(autumn muted) toned I think it would look better on them..
I‚Äôm going to see if I can use different glosses to see if I can manipulate it to look good

I‚Äôm going with 4 stars because I don‚Äôt think it warrants a bad product just color title is miss leading (maybe this brand isn‚Äôt consistent? Not sure but the product feel is really nice",22 Nov 2024,Confused but good,butterflymel48,Anastasia,Lip,No
Not sure if I like the formula . Easily transferable. Not a full lip stain. Prefer nars quality . This is creamy texture,18 Nov 2024,It‚Äôs ok,adjm22,Anastasia,Lip,No

"These lipsticks are incredible! I'm sort of a makeup addict, I've tried hundreds of lipsticks in my day and this formula really is something unique. It's matte but not drying, it stays on for hours and it just makes your lips look amazing, fuller. They feel almost like a powdery gel? It's hard to describe, but extremely comfortable. Even the applicator is nice, it comes to a point so you can get a nice crisp line. I can't say enough good things about these! I have a nude and a dark shade and they are both great!",10 Nov 2024,INCREDIBLE!,SarahR3487,Anastasia,Lip,No

I absolutely love this lipstick! I love the way it feels on my lips. I wish they had a red shade.,3 Nov 2024,A must have!!!!,laherz,Anastasia,Lip,No
I've been looking for matte neutral lip product and this shade and product more than fit the bill. It's long wearing and opaque enough to lighten the natural color of my lips for days I want less emphasis on them. And just pink (I would say a warm pink really) to compliment my skin tone. Highly recommend and taking one star off only because my lips are pretty dry after using it (but nothing crazy or much different than most matte liquids leave my lips).,1 Nov 2024,Gorgeous Shade,PDXXXX,Anastasia,Lip,No
This lipstick was awful‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs so drying and makes my lips look and feel awful. The color was also terrible - almost grey and made me look dead. I immediately threw this one away,29 Oct 2024,Terrible,jillmcc17,Anastasia,Lip,No

"ABH makes amazing products.  I heard these were kinda dry and it was someone I worked with so i trusted her opinion. BIG MISTAKE....when she came out with these darker beautiful colors later on. I was like wow. I knew these had silk and that's not an drying ingredient. Itnhelps smooth your skin, and condition. The trick with these is you must put on a thin layer and DO NOT rub your lips. You pat it on if you need more or smoothing out. I've never had an issue with smudging. Now I wanna try with her lip glosses a bit nervous but she usually formulates everything to mesh well. I'm gonna put a light amount of lip gloss and I'm hoping it won't smear. I bought Rosy Mauve and im so impressed because the color is not you're typical rose mauve. I typically don't like these colors but this HAS DEPTH. And I'm a medium to high contrast.  So light to medium tone, darker hazel eyes, dark brown hair. I feel this color will compliment more skin tones. Good job ABH!",19 Oct 2024,Great formulation,KoreanEwok,Anastasia,Lip,No

"Pure Hollywood is described as ""pale mauve nude."" I would describe it as a medium toned pinkish brown. On my pale skin, it's kind of blech. Better when blotted with a tissue, but still not something I expect to be reaching for. Definitely darker than it appeared based on the sample photos! I also bought Kiss and had the same issue with it being darker than the photo. I was excited to receive these, but pretty disappointed by the colors.",23 Sep 2024,"""Pale"" isn't really pale...",BostonClem,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I have been on the hunt for a dupe for the Tarte Lip Paint in Birthday Suit because it got discontinued awhile ago and I found an old one in my collection while getting rid of old makeup. It was my absolute favourite nude pink for me because it was a warmer pink shade that didn‚Äôt wash me out. I also liked the formula because it had a ‚Äúsofter‚Äù looking effect on the lips that is different from lipstick and felt good on the lips. 

I gave this product a try (shade: Pure Hollywood) and swatched next to each other, they are very similar (ABH on the left, Tarte on the right). I would say the tarte one is maybe a shade darker and a touch warmer/peachier, however I still absolutely love Pure Hollywood. It‚Äôs not an exact dupe for the colour, but it is a relatively similar formula that applies like butter and gives that soft, diffused look on the lips. It slightly emphasizes the lines on my lips in the photo cause my lips are a tad dry, but I find in person they look flawless. I think it has pretty good staying power as well, compared to the tarte one, especially considering it isn‚Äôt transfer proof or anything. 

I am overall super happy with this product as it does make me feel beautiful and I‚Äôd love to try some more shades ü´∂",15 Sep 2024,,LynnNhi,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I really like the texture and the look of this but the color is kinda beige..

"This is the best lipstick I have ever worn and I have tried a ton! It does NOT dry out your lips at all and it lasts for my whole shift of 8+ hours, ever after eating. Just make sure you moisturize your lips with Vaseline or chapstick before applying.

This is possibly the worst lip product I‚Äôve purchased in years. The colors are nothing like what you see online. The rosy mauve is a weird brownish red.

"This product was give to me for free from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review. I received two shades, ‚Äúparchment‚Äù (warm brown) and ‚Äúcrush‚Äù (pinkey nude) and although the colors were bold and beautiful they did not last on the lips. The formula is soft and creamy. Almost like a moose, but the texture never dries down at all. The product ends up coming off while drinking and eating and only lasts on the lips about an hour before you need to reapply. It is definitely hydrating and feels good on dry lips, it is not your go to for a matte long lasting lip productand beautiful",25 Jun 2024,"Beautiful formula and colors, but not long lasting",Kayohxo,Anastasia,Lip,No
If I could give less than one star I would 10/10 for consistency but the color is way different than pictured it is so dark.

This formula truly deserves 5 stars. True to its name - this lipstick gives a velvet finish. I was surprised how moisturized my lips felt after wearing this. It gives a nice smooth finish.,20 Jun 2024,Beautiful formula,glowahontas,Anastasia,Lip,No
"The color looks more peachy in the pictures but it is actually more brown, like really brown. It's very clumpy at first though it does smooth out pretty easily. Personally, what really ruined it for me was the weight of it on my lips. I put it on one half and my new Givenchy Le Rouge Interdit Cream Velvet Lipstick on the other half and the difference was extreme. I'm giving it two stars because it's pretty, even if it wasn't the color I thought it was. I'm a smear it on and forget it kind of gal, so this is not for me, but if you don't mind putting in a little more effort and feeling like you have something on your lips, you might light this.",18 Jun 2024,Really wanted to love this but...,Dulzebel,Anastasia,Lip,No
"Really pretty! I was comparing this, Fenty and Patrick Stars liquid lip to see where I wanted to buy more shades from. I will say the formula of this one was my favorite. Feels velvety and didn‚Äôt dry and settle into my lip lines. The other 2 did outperform it on a wear test with PS not budging all day. That‚Äôs not to say this one didn‚Äôt put up a fight though.

"Anastasia Beverly Hills kindly gave me this liquid lipstick for free so that I could review it. 

First off, I absolutely LOVE the texture of this formula. It is a nice matte liquid lipstick that feels soft on my lips and doesn't dry them out at all. This particular shade (Crush) didn't work as well for my specific skin tone as I had hoped, however I could see it working really well for someone with a different complexion. It is worth noting that I personally tend to go for more pinky nudes and this shade is more of a true beige (as described), so this shade is also a little bit outside of my comfort zone and it may work well for you if you are looking for a true soft beige and find that those types of shades complement you. 

Overall, I give this a 10/10 on formula, application, and color payoff. I won't count the shade-fit itself (for me personally) against the product as a whole because I think that this is really more a matter of personal preference on my end, rather than a reflection on the product itself. Looking at their other available shades, I already see some shades that I think would work better for me and that I would be excited to try--I think both Pure Hollywood and Kiss would probably be solid picks for my complexion and personal preferences. 

Definitely a product worth trying if you are looking for a new matte liquid lipstick.",6 May 2024,,KristenKay524,Anastasia,Lip,No

I absolutely love this lipstick formula. If you liked the Urban decay LO-FI LIP MOUSSE or the Too Faced peach puff diffused matte lip color then you will probably like this one because its very similar.

"The lipstick was gifted to me in exchange for my honest feedback. The formula of this Velvet lipstick has its pros and cons, but for me personally it has more cons to it. While the color is pigmented, and the application is pretty easy, it's not long-lasting at all, moreover it's drying, which was a major disappointment for me. It does feel weightless at first, no stickiness, but the lipstick disappears from your lips quickly, easily transfers to everything and leaves your lips dry. That's not what I'm looking for in my lip products. 
Additionally, orange undertones don't work well for my pale skin, thus I wasn't excited about the color either.",14 Mar 2024,Not a fan,Ginger007,Anastasia,Lip,No
So good. I picked up parchment and peace amber soooooo good. They have became my favorite lip products of the year. I can say if you have one or the other you don't need both. I would recommend parchment for sure.,9 Mar 2024,,BV23,Anastasia,Lip,No
"Do ya'll remember the hype over NYX Soft Matte lip creams? Yes. This is that-- but the luxury version. I have Parchment (too warm for my skin) and Crush (which similar to the vibe that the London/Abu Dhabi shades give from the NYX). But when I say it's long wearing, I mean it! I apply it in the morning and it lasts through my work day, lunch, the gym (and sauna), until I shower. It doesn't cause peeling either, but make sure your lips are moisturized prior because it is soooo much thicker than the NYX.

The lip velvet overall is a great product in which I would highly recommend for people to purchase. It has a very smooth application to the lips and stays on for prolong periods of time. It does come off when eating or drinking but enough color stays on to not have to urgently reapply. I did notice that it tends to dry the lips out but an easy solution would be to apply a gloss or Chapstick in combination. The color variety is inclusive and diverse. I would purchase this product if seeking new lip color in the store.,14 Feb 2024,Definitely will buy again,Beccca302,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I was given two shades of ABH Lip Velvet in Parchment and Crush for my review by ABH and Bzz Agent. In the picture I am wearing Crush, the lighter of the two. This product if quite different then anything I've used before. It's not a liquid lip that doesn't transfer. It a whipped concestancy that performs like a regular tube lipstick when it comes longevity. The texture is interesting, didn't hate it but I think some might. I'm really not sure who the target audience is for this product. It's definitely a quality product that if it fits your needs I would recommend. The packaging is plastic but a very nice quality plastic that almost feels like glass. It feels so good just holding it! The color range is a bit small with mostly nude tones.

I'm also a fan of matte lipstick, and this one was no exception! It glided on easily and didn't feel dry on my lips like alot of matte products do for the lips.

"I received this product as part of a free sample program. The formula of these liquid lipsticks are smooth and not too drying. I like that it gives more of a blurred mousse look instead of a drying matte look. Keep in mind they are not transfer proof.

My biggest issue is the colors/shade range. They seem like they would fit fair skinned people more. I'm pale but I still find that the colors look off on me and unflattering. Even the darkest shade out of this collection is still pretty light. Maybe it would look fine with a lip liner or a darker color on the outside, but I don't usually use a lip liner.

"I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion from Anastasia Beverly Hills. 
I received two velvet mousse matte lipsticks recently from Anastasia Beverly Hills. I .    The shade named Crush is a soft beige color, and it's beautiful with my Fair skintone! The second shade is named Parchment, which is a peachy brown color, which also is a stunning color. I believe that Parchment would be a universal color for all different Skintones and ethnicities. 
The color Crush is better suited for lighter Skintones, in my honest opinion, but it is still very pretty.  These matte lipsticks apply very well, and I love that the applicator is versatile. You additionally can use the applicator to act as a Lipliner by outlining your lips first and then filling in the rest of Your Lips with either lipstick. You also can use a darker shade such as Parchment to outline, and then use a lighter color like Crush to fill in Your lips. 
The texture feels heavenly, unlike most other Matte lipsticks that I use. It feels soft like Mousse.  Both of these products feel comfortable, and after some time, I didn't even remember that I had them on.  These lipsticks lasted through three separate meals! Overall, these lipsticks give a youthful look and look absolutely seamless! Overall, I highly recommend these lipsticks to other novices and professionals alike!

"I recently had the opportunity to try out the Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet in the shades Parchment and Crush. I received these products for free in exchange for my honest review, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.

First and foremost, what stood out to me about these lipsticks is how hydrating they are. As someone who typically avoids matte lipsticks due to their tendency to dry out my lips, I was pleasantly surprised by the formula of the Lip Velvet. It glided on smoothly and kept my lips moisturized throughout the day. The hydration factor is truly remarkable for a matte lipstick.

Now, let's talk about the colors. Parchment and Crush are both stunning neutral shades that complement a variety of skin tones. Parchment is a beautiful nude shade that adds a touch of sophistication to any makeup look. On the other hand, Crush is a lovely mauve shade that adds a subtle pop of color without being too bold. I appreciate how versatile these shades are, making them suitable for both everyday wear and special occasions.

The pigmentation of these lipsticks is top-notch. With just one swipe, you get a rich, opaque color payoff that lasts for hours. Even after eating and drinking, the color remained intact, which is a testament to the longevity of the Lip Velvet formula.

In terms of application, the lipsticks come in a convenient tube with a precise doe-foot applicator. The applicator allows for easy and precise application, ensuring that you can achieve a flawless look with minimal effort.

Overall, I highly recommend the Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet in the shades Parchment and Crush. These lipsticks offer a rare combination of hydration and long-lasting color, making them a must-have in any makeup collection. Whether you're a fan of matte lipsticks or someone looking to try them for the first time, the Lip Velvet range is definitely worth exploring.

"I received 2 colors, crush & parchment. Both of the shades I feel were a little inaccurate to the swatches provided in the photos. However, I really enjoyed this lip product. I love the velvety, smooth finish and how easy it glides on. It‚Äôs creamy but does dry matte. No problem, I just put gloss over it as I do on all my lippies anyways! The staying power isn‚Äôt that great but overall I was pleased with this product. So much so I just added 3 more colors to my cart to purchase on my own!

I had swatched this and knew I needed this shade! It‚Äôs the perfect light mauve tone that‚Äôll look stunning with a deeper pink liner or brown. I have fair olive skin so this cooler shade is perfect! It‚Äôs a velvety formula that‚Äôs very soft on the lip with tons of color payoff and doesn‚Äôt overdry the lips or crack them like most mattes do. Since it is a velvet it will have some transfer. Expect that and for it not to last a whole day. It‚Äôs for those who want a matte without that dried out raisin look on the lips lol,2 Feb 2024,A comfortable matte formula!,missayao,Anastasia,Lip,No

"This is a greatly pigmented, smooth lip mousse. It goes on thick like a lip cream. The pigment is wonderful and never streaky, it glides on with ease and is so smooth. It smells nice like cookies and cream or cookie dough. It feels pretty weightless on the lips and is very comfortable. It dries down matte but not drying at all and doesn‚Äôt sink into fine lines. It actually does the opposite and has this blurring/soft focus effect which is so pretty. The doe applicator is really nice, the tapered top is great for shaping your lips and the centered flat side applies the cream on the lips effortlessly. Definitely the most hydrating matte lip I‚Äôve tried in a while. It reminds me a little of NYX soft matte lip, with its cookie dough similar scent. I love how pigmented the colors are, they are very bold but still wearable making it perfect for both every day wear or an evening out. They aren‚Äôt budge proof but I don‚Äôt mind reapplying. When they did fade, they left almost a tint behind which is nice and looks more natural. They layered pretty well and didn‚Äôt flake or strip the color off while applying a new layer on top. It came off while I ate but that was expected. Its lasting power was around 4-5 hours. The packaging is so sleek, refined and sturdy. I love the gold touches and it fits in any purse making it great to take with you. I love that it‚Äôs cruelty free and cannot wait to try the other colors they have especially the more nude ones.

"I've used this product for about a month now, and it's formulated a lot like other lip souffle style lippies.

I love parchment and crush, and I do find myself reaching for them when I need a boooold lip choice without care of how long it stays. They're not sticky, they glide really well and once they dry down, they don't transfer really. They're a lot like Rare's lip souffles in terms of texture and staying power.

It does transfer but it‚Äôs not marketed as non transfer so that‚Äôs to be expected. I only wish the applicator was bigger and more fluffy. The one it comes with is one the smaller side and a bit stiff but not overly hard so it is still fine. It not being overly big is also okay since it helps get a more precise coverage of the sides of the mouth. My lips in particular are fuller in the middle and thinner on the sides so all in all I guess the applicator is okay as is. I hope there is more colors coming soon.

But I tried ‚ÄúParchment‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrush‚Äù‚Äî they were both insanely pigmented and lasted AWHILE on my lips. While testing, I had to thoroughly clean my lips before applying the second one because it continued to show. So that was very impressive on first try. 

I did dock a star because the formula feels fairly drying, I know that‚Äôs typical in matte lippies but this felt sort of uncomfortable unless I used something much heavier and occlusive on my lips beforehand.

"My first impression of this lipstick was not good but as I kept using it I fell in love with the formula. It is very lightweight and airy but make sure to apply lightly. It can easily get thick if you put too much and will feel heavy and uncomfortable. It's also very pigmented you only need one application. It is not transfer proof which I thought would make me dislike it however the trick I love to use with this lipstick is setting or blotting the lips with tissue paper and dabbing over the tissue with a brush and powder and Voila, problem fixed. I have the shades Crush and Parchment. They're both equally wearable and beautiful colors. Even when my lips are feeling a bit dry or chapped this doesn't cling terribly or accentuate my lines. It looks very smooth. The applicator shape is nice and goes over the contours of the lips easily without getting messy. I have small lips so I overline first with a lip liner and then this lipstick. It is so easy to do with this formula! It doesn't bleed out and I don't find random streaks of it in my face. The scents weren't consistent. One has a really nice scent and the other kind of smelled different but other than that I have no complaints.",27 Jan 2024,Amazing,Courage23,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I have to admit that I tried this liquid lipstick reluctantly because I've had really bad luck with liquid lipstick caking after being applied and drying. This product is different. It goes on nice and smooth and even with the applicator and even after hours of wear it still looks great - no caking or flaking at all. The color stays put and doesn't rub off easily. The Crush color is a nice, soft beige look which is a nice, subtle color for when you want to look nice without dressing up your makeup. I highly recommend that you try this if you have given up on finding a liquid lipstick that you like.",27 Jan 2024,Great matte color and very smoothe look,jcksrobbins,Anastasia,Lip,No
I really liked the packaging and the initial feel of the lip velvet. It's really creamy which made me want to move it around and not stay in place. The color pulled really orange and sis not last as long as I'd like.,27 Jan 2024,Not my favorite but a great product,celiamarie83,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I received crush and parchment and exchange for my honest review so here we go. Let‚Äôs just start out by saying I love this product. It goes on very smoothly and is fairly long lasting. It doesn‚Äôt rub off on cups or when giving kisses which is a big bonus. I also love the colors and think that it could compliment so many different skin tones I have a very fair skin tone and both colors look great on me in my opinion. I would make sure that you moisturizer lips because otherwise it will show , dry cracked lips. I will add that this product did not dry out my lips by any means. I feel like this product is a good representation of the brand and will definitely continue to buy it.",27 Jan 2024,Perfect addition for the natural look,AlyshiaMarie,Anastasia,Lip,No
"This product is amazing if you are looking for a non drying, matte lip!! I only gave four stars because I prefer a more glossy appearance, but this lip really is amazing! Velvet is the perfect word to describe its feeling on the lips!",27 Jan 2024,,Toriamberlong,Anastasia,Lip,No
"I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Is the matte liquid lip trend back already? Well I have always loved a matte liquid lip but the problem with matte liquid lipstick is that it‚Äôs very drying on the lips. Come into play these ABH velvet lipstick. I love how weightless this formula feels on my lips. If applied correctly, it looks flawless on my lips. I didn‚Äôt find them drying on my lips as its a velvet finish and these never fully dry so they don‚Äôt crack your lips like other matte liquid lipsticks. However, here are my negatives for this product. Because of the velvet finish, they don‚Äôt dry completely and transfers everywhere so you need to reapply it throughout the day. The shade range is very limited and cater more towards fair skin type.",27 Jan 2024,Velvet lipstick but..,ushma30,Anastasia,Lip,No
"Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet is a game-changer in the lip game! This velvet-smooth lip mousse delivers weightless, full pigment, true-matte color with a cushioned, comfortable wear. What sets it apart is the teardrop-shaped cushioned wand, making it a breeze to line and apply with just one swipe.

Cruelty-free, this lip velvet boasts a soft-focus finish that beautifully diffuses lip texture. The true-matte color offers an effortlessly polished look without feeling heavy or dry. With multiple nude shades, it‚Äôs a mousse formula that allows for limitless nude lip looks, suitable for all skill levels, especially beginners.

The finish is flattering and blurring on all ages, providing soft to bold lip looks seamlessly. I love how the color appears naturally, smoothing, and moisturizing the lips. It‚Äôs plush, elastic, and gives a fuller-bodied, rich effect. Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet is a must-have for anyone wanting a comfortable, on-the-go lip solution!‚Äù",27 Jan 2024,Velvet Elegance,MegLavon92,Anastasia,Lip,No
"Always been a fan of Anastasia products. However, I am very picky when it comes to any type of lip product and hardly ever use anything besides chapstick or a lip balm. I've never heard of lip mousse before so I was super eager to try it and absolutely fell in love with it. This lip mousse has all the qualities any great lip product should have. I received the shades ""Crush"" and ""Parchment"". Crush is a perfect classic nude color, while Parchment is a slightly darker toned nude color. Both shades have matched great with all of my makeup looks so far without being ""over the top"". The formula is really pigmented, and lightweight. It has a matte finish that doesn't transfer and lasts all day long. I was really impressed that it did not dry out my lips either when most other matte products do. Also love the applicator it's the perfect shape and size that allows you to apply with precision and ease!",27 Jan 2024,"Super Pigmented, Long Lasting!",sumerlove14,Anastasia,Lip,No
"My first impression of this lipstick was not good but as I kept using it I fell in love with the formula. It is very lightweight and airy but make sure to apply lightly. It can easily get thick if you put too much and will feel heavy and uncomfortable. It's also very pigmented you only need one application. It is not transfer proof which I thought would make me dislike it however the trick I love to use with this lipstick is setting or blotting the lips with tissue paper and dabbing over the tissue with a brush and powder and Voila, problem fixed. I have the shades Crush and Parchment. They're both equally wearable and beautiful colors. Even when my lips are feeling a bit dry or chapped this doesn't cling terribly or accentuate my lines. It looks very smooth. The applicator shape is nice and goes over the contours of the lips easily without getting messy. I have small lips so I overline first with a lip liner and then this lipstick. It is so easy to do with this formula! It doesn't bleed out and I don't find random streaks of it in my face. The scents weren't consistent. One has a really nice scent and the other kind of smelled different but other than that I have no complaints.",26 Jan 2024,Perfect pigment and smooth look!,Sarahg2mua,Anastasia,Lip,No

"OMG! I am beyond impressed with this lipstick. The formula is so creamy and smooth. I love how it dries down matte. It's more of a hydrating matte because it doesn't get dry and crusty. I can apply it alone or add gloss to it, and it'll still last most of the day. I have two different shades that mix really well. One looks really good as a liner, and then I blend the lighter shade inside the liner outline. I can't believe how nourishing and moisturizing it feels. My lips never dry out from it. I can easily drink and lightly eat without it transferring. I've always loved ABH lip products, but this new line is a must-have. If you like matte nude lips, you've gotta try these. I definitely recommend them.",26 Jan 2024,My new favorite lipstick! (Crush & Parchment),RachaelTam,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I really love the formulation of this product. I‚Äôm usually a fan of matte bullet lipsticks, but this was a fantastic choice. One thing I will note though is that the colour on the Sephora website isn‚Äôt quite accurate. I would say it‚Äôs more pink on the website than in person. I actually loke to put Lisd first, then top it off with the Pure Hollywood one. It makes a beautiful colour on my lips.",25 Jan 2024,Love them but colour is off,JPP123,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I absolutely love how soft and comfortable these are on your lips. They stay hydrated all day, and it never cracks or makes my lips peel, like so many other mattes. It does transfer a little bit, but still has all day wear. The applicator makes it extremely easy to get a solid outline without needing a liner. Doesn‚Äôt move or feather throughout the day either.

I wore this on New Years Eve. Drops Mic!! lol It literally lasted allllllllllll night. And it didnt begin to feel crusty at any point which made me continue to check because it felt weightless on my lips. I felt like i needed to reapply just because i didnt feel like i had anything on. It kept my lips super moisturized all night. I also wore this under a lip gloss and it locked the entire look in place. I love this and i need more colors!!,24 Jan 2024,Must hAVE,Soleilfor2,Anastasia,Lip,No
"Not sponsored. It‚Äôs absolutely perfect as a liquid lipstick.

Very smooth, moisturizing lip stick!",24 Jan 2024,,MsCourtEE,Anastasia,Lip,No
"I absolutely absolutely loved the feel and application of this matte lipstick. I have never had a matte lipstick that didn't wear down in a strange way. After wearing for a long time it seemed to lightly plumbed away rather than get flakey or chunk like other mattes. I loved that I was able to blend out the edges of my lip or add another shade to the center and blend with a brush so smoothly. I didn't feel like I had a matte lipstick on at all, just a nice powdery feeling that did not dehydrate my lips. Parchment does have a brink orangish undertone (on me) which is something to keep in mind if you're not a fan. 
Otherwise, it's the most amazing matte lip I've EVER tried. 
it also doesn't hurt that the packaging/bottle feels luxurious.",24 Jan 2024,wowzas!,baggaboo,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I‚Äôll first start off by saying, as someone who works in the beauty industry and wants some thing that wears all day so I don‚Äôt have to reapply, this is not the item for me. I was sent the shades Parchment & Crush. When I first received this item to do a review, I loved the packaging because it felt luxurious. It was weighted and designed beautifully. I really wanted to love the product because I absolutely love ABH‚Äôs eyeshadows. But unfortunately, based off of the longevity of the product, I would not recommend this to someone else. The formula feels soft and comfortable on the lips, but feels as though it‚Äôs moving around the entire time it‚Äôs on and the first chance it gets, it transfers and comes off completely. The texture reminds me of the Fenty Icon Velvet Liquid Lipstick which blurs fine lines in the lips. But overall, there are so many lipsticks that wear better for the same price, or even cheaper. On top of that, the color selection is not great. There‚Äôs only 2 shades that I could wear, out of the 6. The shades that are decent for me, won‚Äôt work for anybody deeper, and I‚Äôm tan 1 in the Beauty Blender Skin Tint for reference. I am highly disappointed. I gave this item 2 stars because of the packaging and how soft it feels.",24 Jan 2024,I wouldn‚Äôt purchase this,MuaEAlba,Anastasia,Lip,No

"Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet Liquid Lipsticks are so beautiful! I have been using them in two shades that are absolutely gorgeous. The shade Crush is a soft beige which goes great with my skin tone which is light with warm undertones. The second shade, Parchment is a darker brownish color that I thought I wouldn‚Äôt like at first but after applying it I really love it! The texture of this liquid lipstick is soft and reminds of a creamy mousse. I can‚Äôt say that I have ever used a lipstick with this texture, it‚Äôs very unique. I love how I can apply a thin layer for a light pop of color or build up a couple of layers for that full, rich pigment. The applicator is soft and cushioned so it feels nice on my lips and the shape gives me a smooth & seamless application.

"This is my first time trying ABH Lip products. I was given these two shades for free to review. 

The positive: I like how easy it is to apply this lip product. I think it would look better with a lip pencil lining my lips first. It does stay on for a good bit of time. It didn't wipe off quickly or easily with just a wet wash cloth. 

The negative: The color choices are just too bland. The liquid is very thick and can get clumpy or messy. If you mess up at all, I find that you can not just easily wipe it off. 

I won't be ordering these again unless I see colors I can't live without.",23 Jan 2024,It is ok,JeannaAnderson,Anastasia,Lip,No

This is by far one of the best formulas I have seen as far as a matte finish goes.  There were no lines, or dryness from it, and I did not have to reapply!

"(Anastasia Beverly Hills kindly gave me the Lip Velvet Parchment & Crush lipsticks for free so that I could review them) I was vey looking forward to trying these lipsticks as these are the shades that I never had. When I received them, it was a wow because the packaging is stunning. It even looks more expensive than some luxurious lipstick brands. The texture is light and smooth giving me a beautiful matte finish. To my surprise it matched me more than I thought. I use Crush more because I can match it with different occasions and types of clothes. Parchment is beautiful and sexy but I need some makeup to wear with it. These lipsticks definitely stay long on my lip even when I drink and eat a lot. I cannot wait to buy and try other shades.",22 Jan 2024,Fabulous lipstick,tranglehuy3n,Anastasia,Lip,No

With a plethora of lip products available it can be extremely overwhelming to find the perfect one for the perfect occasion. While I might have chosen a better suited color for my skin tone I cannot deny that this liquid lipstick feels just like velvet upon application. It dries down quickly and leaves a matte finish. Dry lips need not apply! For if this is placed on a dry lip every single line will be enhanced. It feels light on the lip but is easily transferable. If this is your trusted brand and you're looking for a skin tone matte lippie look no further. I myself prefer a juicer lip.

I received this product as part of a free sample program and although I was very happy with it I‚Äôm leaving a 4 star review. This product is a matte so it‚Äôs definitely what I prefer more than a glossy finish. Compared to others that are like this I‚Äôve never enjoyed a color so much as I have this one! My only complaint is that it comes over very easily. It‚Äôs great to wear on a night out and to compliment your makeup for the night just don‚Äôt drink anything while wearing it. I wish it would have stayed on a little better and I didn‚Äôt have to apply it as much throughout the night but overall I did receive multiple compliments on the color!!! Would I purchase on my own? Yes simply for the perfect shade but I would just keep in mind how easily it were to come off.,22 Jan 2024,,,Anastasia,Lip,No
"I received this product as a sample for my honest review and I will be completely honest with my opinion.

I have never been a lipstick person because I just don't think colours outside of chapstick look good on me. However, I was kind of taken back with how well the Anastasia Beverly Hills lip velt liquid lipstick applied for me. I have the peach amber which I kind of assumed to be on the lighter side but it was darker than I thought.. but since I was going to a tropical place for vacation, it kind of worked out for photos I planned on taking! I don't usually splurge on lipsticks but these are definitely much better than the drugstore ones I have been trying.

It‚Äôs still a gorgeous color just not for me.  It feels more like a mouse than a typical matte lipstick which goes on liquid and then dries. It‚Äôs very pigmented and pretty.

"First impressions- the packaging is absolutely gorgeous. The applicator is so soft and flexible, which is really nice when you‚Äôre used to those stiff applicators that are typically in a liquid lip product. l think they really nailed the name of this because it does truly feel like velvet. It‚Äôs super creamy. This isn‚Äôt a long lasting lipstick so keep that in mind.
The two colors I received, Crush and Parchment, are not anywhere close to the color representation shown. They are much darker and lean towards brown. When I first tried Parchment I thought I‚Äôd been transported back to the 90‚Äôs. 
Hopefully they come out with a bigger range of colors because I  would most definitely buy one in a different color- but only after testing the colors in store.",21 Jan 2024,So velvety but color is off,crystalmae83,Anastasia,Lip,No
"I got one in Parchment and another one in Crush. I usually shy away from liquid lipsticks especially in nude-y colors because it‚Äôs often a hit or miss. When it‚Äôs a miss it makes me look sick:( But I was pleasantly surprised by how these colors didn‚Äôt really wash me out and they don‚Äôt feel dry like other matte liquid lipsticks. For reference my shade is ‚ÄúGinger‚Äù or Medium 2 by NARS (light medium with golden undertone), and when I‚Äôm not tanned during winter Crush is good for nude lips. I recommend pairing it up with a lip liner in Peach Amber (by Anastasia) or something close to that if you want a little definition on your lips. I also love the color when I mix Crush and Parchment - it‚Äôs like warm nude (shown in the photo). This will be my go-to when I get tanned and want nude lipstick!

"Super soft and velvety, this matte formula is kind of like a mouse-y formula that reminds me of others that I‚Äôve seen in a lot of k-beauty brands. It‚Äôs comfortable to wear, but since it doesn‚Äôt dry down completely, the wear time is not like a regular matte liquid lipstick- it will transfer. It gives a matte, almost blotted kind of finish.  It‚Äôs nice and I do like the formula, though it‚Äôs not my absolute favorite formula to wear, probably because of the transfer issue. The shade Parchment is described as a Peachy Brown. It pulls pretty dark and brown on me, it would be a nice fall shade. Overall a nice formula.",19 Jan 2024,Velvety,sarahjeangirl,Anastasia,Lip,No
I was given this item free for an honest review and just love this product so much! The color isn't my absolute favorite but I love how velvety and soft this makes my lips feel. It goes on so smooth compared to any other matte product I have ever worn. I actually went to buy a different color but they aren't in store around me yet. I can't wait to get another one!,19 Jan 2024,Best Matte Gloss,JL116,Anastasia,Lip,No
I love how smooth the color goes on and that it does NOT flake.   I feel like this color would be complimentary for most skin tones and it just goes with everything.  I cant always wear a bright red to work...but this lovely shade always seems to make me look more polished,19 Jan 2024,Definite Keeper,alwaysasia,Anastasia,Lip,No
"So, what I liked about these, the color payoff is great! I wish every makeup item was like this in that regard! The packaging is classic and gorgeous. It applies super smoothly and creamily. I think it's the mousse formulation that makes application an amazing experience! That is definitely a new, and fabulous, formula!
For my personal downsides, this smudges way too easily for my liking. But, to be fair, I do drink coffee a ton during the day and snack occasionally, so I might not be the best judge at smearing and fading! Which leads me to the next issue, the color fades weird on me. Like it sticks around the edges of my lips? Again, might just be a me issue! I did get these free in exchange for a review!",19 Jan 2024,Might or might not re-buy,jules79,Anastasia,Lip,No
"I was sent this product for free as part of a free sample program in exchange for an honest review - and honestly, I am not a fan. I tried this several times in several ways and I just wasn't into it. The color was far too light, even though this was the darkest one they had available. I also tried the shade Crush and if Parchment was too light, Crush was a nightmare on my darker skintone. I tried it with lip liner, with a much lighter application, in the center of the lips with my other lipsticks...I just couldn't get into it. The feel of it is very silicone-y and with a lot of slip and felt like it was on top of my lips, not on them. The color sunk on my lip lines in a way I did not like. I only really liked the packaging since it was easy to find in my bag and the applicator, which felt decent. I would not buy another one of these, even if they branch off to non-nude shades. It's just not my type of lip product, it seems.",19 Jan 2024,Disappointments all around,EndlessWonder,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I'm a fabulous melanin-rich queen with warm undertones, and let me spill the tea on the Lip Velvet Liquid Lipstick‚Äîit's on the brighter side, honey! You might need a dark lip liner to keep it in check, but once you conquer that, it's a race against the clock because this lipstick dries faster than my witty comebacks. Nevertheless, it looks so good, it's practically my lips' red carpet moment.

Can we talk about the size of that lip package, though? It's bigger than my weekend plans, and I absolutely adore that about it. This lipstick is like a long-lasting relationship; I wore it to feast like a queen, and my lips were still slaying the game.

Lovely shade that wears super comfortably on the lips. I‚Äôm a deep tone and this color worked great for me. The applicator made it so easy to fill in my lips like I wanted to without wasting product. The lipstick isn‚Äôt runny like the typical liquid lipsticks tend to be. This is a definite upgrade and I recommend it big time!,19 Jan 2024,ABH has done it again!,San4Short,Anastasia,Lip,No

The Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip velvet glides on so smoothly and is so creamy compared to other products I tried. The color is rich and pigmented. If you love the original feel of lipstick on your lips then this is for you. I used to love wearing lipsticks but got annoyed of it not staying on so I stuck with liquid lipsticks. But this product keeps my lips hydrated while staying on all day. I recommended this product to a few of my friends and they loved. Pair this with a cute lip liner and slide that smooth applicator stick on those lips. It doesn‚Äôt have a sticky feel on the lips and there is no after taste which is a plus. You can mix parchment and crush together. I like to use crush for the center since it‚Äôs lighter and parchment overall since it‚Äôs darker. The colors are perfect for any event day or night. On top of that this product itself is so beautiful to look at and have it in your bag. The look of the product complements the actually product. Overall it just looks so expensive on and in your bag without breaking your budget.

I was unsure at first about a matte lipstick that comes in a gloss container with an application but it's great thentear drop applicator allows for one swipe, all day wear, it moisturizes and prevents drying, cracking or flaking. It is easy to remove.  It's long lasting with hardly any touch ups needed.    I will definitely be purchasing these again",19 Jan 2024,LIP velvet is my new go to,NikkiRachelle84,Anastasia,Lip,No

Product feedback:  the Lip Velvet truly felt luxurious and I loved how the mousse felt on my lips.  It did not dry out my lips like some other matte lip finishes tend to do.

"I got Parchment and Crush free in exchange for review! the formula is smooth, moussey and has a silicone feel. it's so comfortable to wear, feels like nothing on. however, the staying power is not good. it transfers and smudges a lot. i still rate it 5 stars for this type of formula though, as most mousse lipsticks are like this. it's similar to the nyx soft matte lip creams and also to some kbeauty liquid lipsticks like romand milk tea velvet tints. ABH is more smoothing compared to the romand ones and doesnt settle into my lip lines as much. im not a fan of the colours i received; Crush is too light and nude for my nc18-20 skin tone. it would not work on many people unless they like a pastel nude. parchment is better but a bit brown for my liking. this formula blurs out beautifully so i like to blot it for a soft look. because these are so moussey and soft, they actually mix with other formulas really well. i mixed Crush and a Sephora lipstories lipstick that was too purple for me and i liked the resulting colour a lot better.

"I really enjoyed the comfortable  sliky formula. It wears very lightweight on the lips. However, it was not as long last in as I had anticipated. The color wore off as soon as I took a sip from my glass. The one good thing about this it's  easy to reapply a secondary layer over the worn off layer.
It does that without caking or looking rough, so touch-ups are possible. The Parchment color was a better match for me. It was more peachy brown notes in that and the Crush color was a bit too pink for my skin tone. Overall I hope that you colors our introduced.

The first feeling about these lipsticks is that the lipstick design is so excellent, they are so beautiful and luxurious.  I also like the way they designed the tip of the liner, I can use the sharper tip to outline my lips and then use the flatter part to apply lipstick on my lips.  I love the soft and velvety texture of this liquid lipstick, it feels very light on the lips, the finish is super matte and the color is extremely beautiful.  It's a bit surprising because it lasts quite a long time compared to other regular liquid lipsticks.  Personally, I lean a little towards Parchment because it suits my skin better.

The first thing I noticed was how it glided smoothly on my lips. Usually, long-lasting lipsticks have a thick and dry formula. This was the complete opposite. 

One of the benefits of owning this product is that the size is not so big so it fits in any small pocket or purse for a night out, however, don't be fooled, little goes a long way with this product. 

I am purchasing this product, I want to try the rest of the tones. I am sure I will not be disappointed.",17 Jan 2024,Need one in every shade!,Lesliejazzyjaz,Anastasia,Lip,No

I do recommend it the product is thick, but it‚Äôs not too thick. It has no smell no taste which is fine with me. It puts you in the mind of a lipstick but not a lipstick. I feel like it‚Äôs perfect.

"HOLY COW! This lippie is freaking phenomenal! 

I was extremely skeptical about the formula upon opening the packaging and thought I got influenced by the all the incentivized reviews to buy another flop, BUT NOPE!

This is what I believe what the liquid lipstick game back in 2014 YT era should've been. This goes so perfect with a dark lip liner (or any liner really) for the ombre effect. The formula is very lightweight and this is one of those products where less is more ideal as I can see how layering this product can cause it to look cakey on the lips. It really did not dry down on my lips to where it felt like I had something on my lips which is an issue I have often with liquid lipsticks. This really has a blurring effect on the lips and doesn't settle into fine lines too much (although a little settling is going to happen with any product). 

The texture is very mousey for all my texture hating besties out there lol but this is going to be a product I am constantly going to be reaching for and will be buying the remaining colors.

It applies easily and evenly and is quite pigmented. However, I was disappointed that after a short time on my lips it felt a bit drying, and I applied some gloss to give myself a bit of added moisture.

"First, I‚Äôd like to thank Buzz Agent and Anastasia for the free sample of Lip Velvet in Crush in exchange for my honest review. The texture is luxurious, it glides across your lips just like the name says, velvet. It feels soft and clean, not even in the realm of sticky, but on the downside, this lipstick was a serious mess and got everywhere! There were little clumps that formed all around my lip line, these quickly spread to my hands, shirt, forehead and my lips looked like I smeared chocolate ice cream all over my mouth! It also lacked longevity. It's a very nice feel, but this one is not for me.

"The innovative lipstick formula is more like whipped mousse. 

A thin layer lies on the lips without emphasizing the relief, on the contrary, it smoothes it. 

The packaging is simple and incredibly aesthetic! 

The shade Crush is a beige-pink nude with a warm undertone. 
Perfectly combined with richer liners. 

The next shade Parchment is a rich color of milk chocolate. Unfortunately, it is too dark for me. I will try it in the summer for a more tanned tone. 

The characteristics are simply incredible! The lipstick is stay long, can withstand a light snack and non-greasy food. 

Visually blurs the lips, filling the folds. 

The aroma is sweet but not cloying.

It is definitely Matt but not drying the colors does a little bit but I found it to transfer everywhere like my coffee cup in spoon while eating. I do love that you really can use the product as a lip liner and lipstick all in one due to the shape of the applicator. However, this formula did not deliver on the blurring a fact that it promised, in fact, it showed more wrinkles that I‚Äôve ever seen on my lips which I really didn‚Äôt like bottom line I personally as a woman in my early 40s would not purchase this product.

"I received this lipstick for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

It's.... okay. The whole vibe of this lipstick feels very mid 2010s dated. It's that hype matte, crusty nude in different shades of brown. I didn't find the color particularly flattering, but will be using it at a grunge-themed costume party later this week. I know it's winter, but it made my lips look unreasonably patchy and dry. It didn't have much staying power, either... which can usually be a strong point for matte lipsticks. Worst of all, when it wore away, it left just the outline of the lipstick, leaving me with a truly 90s brown lipliner look. 

I just don't think this is worth it. The ""velvet"" component here just meant that the lipstick pilled up on your lips and looked altogether unflattering. Pass. 

Maybelline has a super stay matte liquid ink lipstick that blow this out of the water in every way. Do not waste your money on this.",14 Jan 2024,Mediocre,criticalreviews,Anastasia,Lip,No
I like to line my lips with a lip liner but you don‚Äôt have too the applicator is a tear drop shape with a dip in the middle. I do have fuller lips and can swipe both lips without having to apply more. It is very lightweight and feels smooth. It really needs time to set and isn‚Äôt transfer proof and will need to reapplied a few times. It‚Äôs so comfortable I sometimes forget I‚Äôm wearing it. The colors I got looked a bit pink and dark but when applied I actually liked the way they dried down.

"If you're a fan of matte finish, this one is a win. It's really soft and non drying. Crush is a soft color that I think would work for most anyone. That being said, I feel like it spreads a little too easily which left it a little too blurry for me. Also, as a 40-something, it settles into every tiny line and really made me see my lips in a whole new, not positive, way. It was really obvious with Parchment being darker but not as bad on the Crush.",13 Jan 2024,Softest matte lipstick yet,Nickie15,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I received Parchment and Crush for free for a product review. I have worked with a lot of matte lipsticks. The current shades available will not work for any darker skin tones. It applied nicely and felt very soft however it does not have a lick of staying power. It got on my clothes, came off on my cups, got all over my teeth. And at the end of the day, really emphasized all the wrinkles on my lips. Looks beautiful, performs poorly. A shame, because the packaging is very luxe.",13 Jan 2024,,bina05,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I got this as a free sample and I AM IN LOVE! My lips are naturally dry and I still prefer matte products over glossy or oily. This gives my lips hydration and that matte finish that I prefer. I received crush and parchment. I love the color parchment out of the two. The crush color would be better for a bolder eye make up with my olive skin tone while the parchment color I can wear everyday without the overly done make up look! 

The packaging for this is probably one of my favorites. It‚Äôs not too big or small. I lose a lot of things in my bag so when I‚Äôm looking for a quick lipstick refresh I can just grab this from my purse without having to actually look for it (it‚Äôs distinct size and packaging helps me decipher it from the other 5 lip products I carry around with me)

"I received the parchment and crush lip products and I am so amazed with how beautiful this product is. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the first Anastasia matte lip products because they felt very chalky and would crack or dry out my lips. This new product on the other hand feels super velvety so the name is a perfect description. It stays soft even after hours of application. Also, the applicator has a narrow pointed tip at the end that makes applying to other people super easy and effortless. You can basically line your lips with it too.

"I received this product as a free sample in exchange for my review 
Lip velvet is a great name for this product.  It looks and feels like soft velvet on my lips.  It's easy to apply and gives smooth full coverage.  It seems to be fairly resistant to smudging as there wasn't much product transfer when I blotted with a tissue after applying.  It has a pleasant vanilla/sugar fragrance that isn't overwhelming.   I don't love the color choice for me, as it doesn't look flattering to someone with pink undertones.  But I'll definitely try this in a different shade",12 Jan 2024,,princsss,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I want to share my experience with Lip Velvet Parchment & Crush, a product that I had the opportunity to try thanks to a free sample program. Upon receiving this lipstick as part of the sample.

Lip Velvet Parchment & Crush is an exceptional product that stands out for its formula of matte tones without drying out the lips. Unlike other products I've tried, this lipstick offers a moisturizing sensation that lasts, providing comfort throughout the day.

This detail is especially useful to achieve a defined contour and highlight the natural beauty of the lips. In addition, Lip Velvet Parchment & Crush provides a voluptuous lip effect, adding a touch of glamor to any look.

Personally, I find this product worth the money. The combination of matte shades, long-lasting hydration, and the precise applicator make it a must-have in my daily beauty routine. The moisturizing sensation is notable, which differentiates it from other similar products on the market.

If you are looking for a lipstick that offers both intense color and care for your lips, I would definitely recommend the Lip Velvet Parchment & Crush. Furthermore, due to its unique features, I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends and family.

"I received this Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet in Parchment for free in exchange for writing my honest review. I love nude color lip products and this peachy brown shade looks good on my natural lip color. It definitely feels velvety and mousse like but dries down matte. It is full coverage in a way it‚Äôs very pigmented and you don‚Äôt need to use a lot. The applicator tip is nice to use for more precision application on the edges of our lips. It does rub off when you eat or drink so you will need to reapply. For me, I have very dry lips so it did feel drying later in the day and I need to put lip balm or lip gloss.",12 Jan 2024,,evfreebie,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I received two different shades to try in exchange for my reviews but unfortunately only one of the shades worked for me. I was really excited to try this because I love Anastasia products. My go to lipstick is their liquid lipstick so I was expecting the same long lasting qualities from this one. Upon applying it the first thing I noticed was the texture. It was very smooth but at the same time it dried out quickly so it was not as easy to apply as other lipsticks. I did like that it felt pretty weightless though. It didn‚Äôt feel drying even though it‚Äôs a super matte finish. If you want a matte lip this is it. The colors are very pretty, you just have to find the one that goes well with your skin tone. The biggest drawback is that it‚Äôs not transfer free. I‚Äôm used to my other Anastasia liquid lipstick to be long lasting and nontransferable. But this one rubs off easily. It looks like it‚Äôs completely dry on your lips and that it won‚Äôt fall off but it does transfer. That would be my biggest complaint. Other than that I would recommend it to anyone looking for a matte lipstick because the color and finish are beautiful.",12 Jan 2024,Great matte finish.,fumariel,Anastasia,Lip,No

Since receiving both Crush and Parchment I used them alone and with other lip products. They are very creamy and don‚Äôt flake like some matte lip products. The only negative thing that I would say was that I don‚Äôt think the colors match their descriptions. If buying online I‚Äôd look for actual swatches of them. I added two pictures with and without flash.,12 Jan 2024,Soft buttery matte,CReiss1982,Anastasia,Lip,No
"I've always been pretty skeptical of matte lip products but this one is surprisingly really nice and I don't find it drying or irritating. It also faded nicely throughout the day without getting flakey or weird. Plus I tried it as a blush, which looked super pretty, and that's a big win because I love multifunctional products. Overall, I think it great when my lips are properly moisturized, but as with all matte lip products I would avoid it on dryer/crustier days or stick with it as a blush.

"I tried the new Parchment shade of Anastasia Lip Velvet. If you like nude shades, this is a bold highly-pigmented nude shade with full coverage. The feel of it is hard to describe because it is so soft and smooth without any sticking or tackiness. It is a true matte finish and I love that the tip can act as a liner especially if you keep it for on the go. If you overline your lips I would still use a lip pliner because this mousse gives a blurred soft edge not a defined outline. The one con is while I would consider this a long-lasting lip coverage but it doesn't hold up well when eating or drinking.  I have truly loved the opportunity to try this new product that I received as part of a free sample program. Having said that, it will be purchased in the future.

"This shade was not meant for me or anyone in my colorwheel. I tried making it work with my go to brown liner, but it didn't help but so much. I tried this lipstick in the shade Parchment and loved the formula and color but I had the opposite feelings about Crush. This was super drying, very hard to blend with my liner and cracked within 30 minutes. I had to remove it soon after. This washed out my color and make me look like Dave Chappelle in that one skit on his show lol. I gave this so many chances but just couldn't get it to work.

"I didn't have high hopes because I have yet to find a liquid lipstick that worked for me. I instantly fell in love with this shade, Parchment. While I did have to pair it with a deep brown lip liner, it is still such a beautiful shade on my deeply melanin blessed skin! I found this to be creamy, and it didn't dry down to the point that it was cracking or peeling. It felt super comfortable on my lips. I didn't notice any wear and tear or transfer until around hour 5, which is not bad at all. It doesn't have a chemical smell or taste like other liquid lipsticks I've tried.

It's velvety soft and smooth on the lips; not at all drying. I love that the applicator has an edge you can use to get a sharper lip line, but I don't usually use that side because I prefer to have a more blurred edge.

I was pleasantly surprised that this Matte lip velvet mousse was so smooth! Usually Matte is drying but this held the Matte effect and stayed velvety for hours! Even with eating and drinking the lip velvet lasted. 
It is thicker than others I have used which I liked also. It was very light weight. It also eliminated the need for lip liner because it was so precise however, it did bleed into fine lines a little and I may use lip liner anyway, but it certainly isn't necessary or that noticeable.
  The color was very nice. However it was a little more orange than the soft pink that it looks like in the photo which was very disappointing because it didn't go with my skin tone. However this won't be the case with everyone. I still love the color and it only has a slight orange hue. 
  This does transfer, it came off on my straw and when I kissed my baby. 
  Overall I would recommend this. Due to how long it lasts, you really don't need to re-apply often and I see it lasting for a very long time.",10 Jan 2024,"Velvety, non-drying, super smooth.",Autumn0817,Anastasia,Lip,No

"So I am 100% obsessed with any and all lip products and Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet was no exception. I loved how soft and moisturizing it felt when I applied it, and the matte pigment with just one application lasted quite a few hours during which I had consumed a couple cups of coffee and a quick morning snack and even then I still didn‚Äôt need to reapply until after lunch and that it a definite pro in my book. However as much as I loved the palette of nude shades offered I really wish they would come out with colors that have both pigment & shimmer to them. I have never been one to like the look of matte lipstick on myself and so usually end up layering matte colors with a tinted shimmer gloss over them to achieve the look I prefer, unfortunately doing that does cause the pigment to come off a lot faster than wearing the pigment alone so hopefully they will expand the variety of colors they offer and include a shimmer in them in the future because I really loved everything about the product except for the plain matte look and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the look of a matte lip color as well as to anyone who needs the added moisture it provides. I received this product for free to sample in the color Crush and the color Parchment from Anastasia Beverly Hills & the BzzAgent sampling program in exchange for my honest review.",9 Jan 2024,I hope they add colors with shimmer‚Ä¶.,JessG2102,Anastasia,Lip,No

"Having experienced the Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet in Crush and Parchment, I‚Äôm impressed by the blend of beauty and functionality. The lightweight formula defies the common issue of colors washing out, and Parchment which is a peachy brown color has surprisingly become my preferred shade.

"Let me start by saying , the smoothness of this formula is nice BUT..shade range is so so similar with these and a bit boring for warmer skin tones. I would of loved more diverse shades to flex with especially for tan warm skin. Now, the Parchment shade is a nice shade out of this line up for tan skin to work with without having concealer lips. This shade is definitely a warm pumpkin color or /terracotta wit hint of brown  and the Peach Amber just 1 shade lighter to compare but its also a terracotta peachy.  Pure Hollywood ,Kiss and Peachy Nude....ALL Look the same on tan skin : Concealer lips !!  If im going to spend 24 bucks , I shouldnt have to always use a lip liner to make a color work!  Crush could possibly be the happy universal shade out of this bunch but still no diversity here. Where are the Reds, Berry's, True Mauves, but only giving us 2 pumpkin and concealer nudes working  only for fair skin lips ! ???  ABH can do better for a launch .  I dont get it. Looks like only Parchment is my only best choice if i want pumpkin orange  lips ....but is that new ? no.  lol",8 Jan 2024,pumpkin lips,renalove12,Anastasia,Lip,No
I received this product through Bzz Campain and it was really excited about trying this velvet Lipstick. I've been able to try this product for a week and I genuinely love it. It feels soft on my lips. It's really creamy and even though the shade is a little darker than the pictures Ill still use it in my daily routine.

"Ehhh not for me. I received this product complimentary from #bzzagent and #anastasia in exchange for my honest review. So here it goes!

The colors and packaging of the Anastasia Lip Velvet is SO beautiful. However, they call it lip velvet for a reason I suppose. It felt so heavy on my lips. I love lip color but I don‚Äôt like feeling like I have a ton on. Unfortunately that‚Äôs how it felt for me. That being said, this product is not for me!",8 Jan 2024,Not for me,SarahAGoBills,Anastasia,Lip,No

I highly recommend this product.",8 Jan 2024,A beautiful  peachy brown shade,SlayaDrea,Anastasia,Lip,No
I tried the colors Crush and Parchment. I have very pigmented lips and Crush looked ashy on me. Parchment was a great neutral for me. I also tried mixing the two colors and that was a pretty color as well. Now for the formula. It‚Äôs very soft and velvety. It‚Äôs mousse-like. It glides on smoothly and it‚Äôs very pigmented. For being a matte lipstick I‚Äôm surprised that it‚Äôs non drying on the lips. I do make sure my lips are moisturized prior to wearing though. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about the formula is that it‚Äôs not very long lasting. You definitely need to reapply throughout the day. I do really like the tapered end on the applicator. It allows you to line your lips and then use the flat part to fill in. I would recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a nice matte lip color.,8 Jan 2024,Nice non drying matte lipstick,akristin333,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I received shade Crush and Parchment from Bzzagent in exchange for my honest review.
In my opinion, this is one of the best lip products from ABH so far. It is soft, creamy and applies butter on the lips.
It has a mousse formula and it feels like you have literally nothing on the lips.
Shade parchment is an especially beautiful warm shade that would suit most skin tones.
I also love the applicator, it picks up a good amount of product and is very precise. It smoothes out my lip lines as well. It does not feel heavy and tight like a matte lipstick, but the longevity is there. and applies  butter",8 Jan 2024,One of the best from ABH so far,anmolarorajain,Anastasia,Lip,No
"I am reviewing the shades Crush and Parchment. I normally have trouble finding a matte lipstick that I like because they are so drying and settle into my fine lines and throughout the day my lips just look worse and worse but not with these!

"Anastasia Beverly Hills
Lip Velvet Liquid Lipstick has solved a lip issue for me. I love the feel and look of a neutral matte lip color, but used to have to apply lip treatment and liners to keep my lips from being dry to the point of peeling and to keep the products in place when combined. This particular color is dreamy, it comes on not sooo stark and is muted. THe forumla is WONDRFUL, it not only is not drying, but almost conditioning. I LOVE THE COLOR and TEXTURE of the lipstick. The only drawback is that I found that I had to re-apply it (more than the other shade I tried) once or twice when wearing it for a full day. HOWEVER, it is easy to re-apply and basically fills right in without looking ""fresher"" than the rest of your makeup.

They have the matte look but don not dry your lips.  I‚Äôve had that issue with other lipsticks.  I was impressed on how smooth it goes on and stays on.

They're not super drying (but it is a liquid lip, so there is still some dryness there), and they feel comfortable on the lips. The packaging is gorgeous and feels super luxe. 

I took off a star for two reasons-- one being that while it doesn't instantly disappear when eating or drinking, it doesn't have the same longevity as the Kaleidos; and two because a lot of the shades they launched with are pretty similar.

"I received this product as a free sample through the BzzAgent sampling program. 

I'm a sucker for peachy brown, terracotta lip and cheek shades, and Parchment is a beautiful option to have. The formula works well on lips and cheeks, and it's easy to work with whether you want a light, sheer wash of color or build up to a bolder, opaque look.

Crush is a perfect nude shade for me (light-medium, neutral skin tone) and layers well with other lip products.

I appreciate that I can get good color payoff even with a thin layer. The mousse like texture is lightweight and blends easily without spreading too much - it's easy to control where the color goes.

"I've been trying this product for a few weeks as part of my regular lip routine. The formula is not sticky and leaves a velvet, matte finish. It dries down to an almost velvet stain. The color is pigmented and like most matte/velvet products, feels lightly powdery, but is not too caked if applying after a lip balm. It feels smooth and buttery although it still has the tendency to have patchy color if using on dry lips. Although the picture shows the pure color, I normally tend to wear a dark nude-brown liner before applying, then adding a bright pop of red or pink to the middle of my lips. I am a warm-neutral and these shades tend to look too cool for me although I can still find lots of ways to incorporate them. The formula is thick and as standard, it's rare to find an even one swipe applicator.

"I received Crush and Parchment, and have really enjoyed the vibrant colors and velvety finish! I‚Äôve included pictures of how the colors look against my skin- I have a warm beige tone to my skin, and that seems to bring out the brown undertones in the shades. Crush looks really nice, a beautiful blend that looks natural. Parchment appears much deeper than the sample pictures, which looks rather modern and sophisticated. 
Unlike other matte finishes, the Anastasia velvet doesn‚Äôt get flaky, and blends nicely without extra smearing. It will transfer but reapplication is easy and doesn‚Äôt look uneven. The brush applies very evenly. ‚ÄúVelvet‚Äù is the perfect description for these lip colors, because it stays light-weight and smooth. It also isn‚Äôt a dry matte, so it doesn‚Äôt make my lips look dehydrated. 
Taking it off is really easy, I don‚Äôt need heavy makeup removers to remove the product.

Hey hey I tried crush along with parchment and both colors were amazing.  Reminded me of the 90's. I loved the buttery feel.  The coverage was great.  I have never tried a product that was matte but felt softening at the same time I just wanted to keep rubbing my lips together.  I did not like the applicator.  I didn't have any lip liners in the correct shades so I put this on without it.  I tried to line and fill my lips with it and it was not working the way I wanted.  So I think this definitely needs liner.  Problem fixed lol.  Shades were very matte.,7 Jan 2024,,Mmmkayy,Anastasia,Lip,No

I love mixing the two colors using Parchment as a long wear liner and Crush to fill in the middle, and my lips dont look super dried out and crusty. It mixes well with gloss on top, tho I will say it does shorten the wear time.

"First off, I love the packaging. ABH is a classy brand and the packaging for the lip velvets are classy and the liquid lipstick clicks into place so it doesn't get messy in your purse. It's matte but comfy. I got the shade Parchment, which a deeper taupey brown. Suits my skin tone more than the shade Crush. It reminds me of the lipsticks the Kardashians usually wear, you know? The nude-y type with a slight hint of color. I usually don't really like matte lipstick formulas but this one is comfy, I usually still top it with clear gloss but it is nice and you get a lot of product. The applicator is nice and allows you to define your Cupid's bow. The shade Crush is also pretty but kinda light for me and giving concealer lips. I am a medium skin tone with yellow undertones.

"I received two liquid lipsticks in Parchment and Crush colors for free in exchange for honest review.

The Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet offers a luxurious matte finish with a velvety texture. Its highly pigmented formula provides vibrant color payoff that lasts throughout the day. 

The application is smooth and precise, and the range of shades caters to various preferences. The velvety texture feels weightless on the lips during application, contributing to a comfortable wear experience. The matte finish delivers a sophisticated look, but it's advisable to exfoliate and moisturize lips beforehand to prevent any dryness. Overall, a solid choice for those who prioritize vibrant, long-lasting color with a matte finish.

"I have been making the switch to liquid lipstick gradually, having tried everything from Colour Pop to Tarte and even Beauty Bakerie before they obviously changed the formula. I‚Äôve been an avid consumer of Anastasia‚Äôs brow products, but didn‚Äôt know how the liquid lip would measure up. Fortunately for me, it packs quite a punch! I was impressed with the fullness of the shade, as it can be really hard to find a nude shade with a hint of tint to allow for a pop of color. I also thought the product itself held up well; it set pretty quickly, and I didn‚Äôt really feel like I needed to reapply for several hours. I also enjoyed the subtly of the shade. My one complaint is that the formula does feel on the thicker side, but running the wand inside of the neck of the tube plus exfoliating my lips ahead of time kept the secondary application much less messy.",6 Jan 2024,Great little gift for yourself!,AMPlified1013,Anastasia,Lip,No

"Anastasia Beverly Hills' new Lip Velvet Liquid Lipstick is perfection in a matte, nude lip formula! Upon first opening this liquid lipstick, I immediately knew that I loved the shade, because I thought it would look great with just about any look I decided to put together with makeup and fashion. The shade Crush, in my opinion, is an excellent option for a nude shade. With that being said, I was in awe over the formula once I applied it! It's amazingly lightweight to the point of feeling like a feather brushing onto your lips. Given that it's a matte formula, I was even more impressed by how buttery-smooth it applied and how creamy it was when rubbing my lips together to disperse evenly. I literally felt like I was applying a moisturizing lip treatment. That immediate satisfaction continued even after I had it on for a while. Matte lip formulas have come a long way and it's not as difficult to find a lip product in a matte finish that feels hydrating going on, but after some time has passed, I can usually still differentiate between a matte or a satin, for example. With the new Lip Velvet Liquid Lipsticks, I can't tell that it's a matte formula unless I look in the mirror. This liquid lipstick continues to lend that creamy moisture to the lips while feeling light as a feather! The texture feels super luxurious while providing a beautiful matte finish to the lips that blurs my fine lines and other little imperfections. This particular formula not only enhances my lips, but it also gives a fuller appearance. The lasting power was impressive as well, to say the least. Obviously, most of us would expect a matte formula to withstand several hours, but not one that feels like a lightweight, whipped formula that still manages to also feel rich and velvety smooth! Clearly I can't stop raving over the new Lip Velvet Liquid Lipstick in the shade Crush thanks to its optimal quality and performance. This formula translates to...a matte, liquid lipstick at its best!!",6 Jan 2024,Perfection in a Nude Lip!,IzzyFrost2,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I received two shades, crush & parchment. They're both pretty colors, definitely warm toned shades.. the formula itself is absolutely PERFECT!! It's literally every person‚Äôs dream! However.. I will say this velvet lip shade (crush) is NOT the same as her liq lipstick in crush, it‚Äôs not as nude/pink.. it‚Äôs more of a brownish-mauve shade. On the lips it's not too noticeable, but in the right lighting, this one is definitely a tad darker. I'm not mad at it though lol. I tried getting good lighting for the pics to try to show the difference. Top lip is this new formula, bottom lip is their regular matte liquid lipstick.

"This is one of the most comfortable lip products I have ever used. The texture is really soft and it isn't sticky at all. It does leave some residue on glasses when drinking and it does rub off some throughout the day - however, it has excellent staying power. After an 8-hour day, my lips were still fully colored. I also tested this product with a matching Anastasia Beverly Hills lip liner and it worked well together.

I tried crush and parchment. Crush is a bit lighter and is my favorite for daytime use, however, I do use parchment when I'm going out at night. Crush is a soft beige color and on my skin, it shows just the tiniest bit of orange.

The packaging is very nice and holds up well to travel. I also liked the shape of the wand. It made application easy. 

Overall, I really love this product and I will be purchasing again! This is one of my new favorites with the combination of the texture and the long-lasting application.",5 Jan 2024,New Favorite!,Lisa23471,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I received this product as a free sample program promotion for my honest review. It‚Äôs been snowy and gloomy lately in upper Michigan. The lightning does not do much justice. The lip velvets are so darn comfortable and smooth on the lips. My husband complemented me and said the lipsticks are lovely on me. The lipstick stayed on fairly well after sipping on some coffee. I ate a burger and of course it did come off.  This formula is not kiss proof. I like to pat dry my lips on a soft paper napkin after the lipstick sets to make sure it last a bit longer. A little goes a long way, so be gentle with the application. The lipstick applicator is perfect to apply on the lips. The applicator is soft and has a pointed tip. The applicator also has a flat surface. I recommend this formula of all ages. It is very comfortable on the lips. I hope to see more colors released in this formula. I like how this formula feels soft on my lips and doesn‚Äôt dry them out. I have dry lips and this looked beautiful still. Parchment is a gorgeous cool tone brown. Crush is a beautiful beige color. On my skin tone, crush looks peachy nude. The package of the product is absolutely stunning. I love the gold reflective top that has your signature.

"I tried the Crush version and really enjoyed that. The parchment one here was not the most flattering for me. I have a light complexion as an East Asian and thought this one might not be the best received across the consumer base. I think it falls into the category of products where you either love it or hate it. I have tried lip products in the brown range but this one was not my favorite.

Also, I'm not sure why this is but this one felt quite drying compared to the Crush one. It gave my lips a cracked look after just a few minutes of this on. Strangely, it doesn't feel very pigmented and requires a lot to actually make a difference. If at the least the colour looked nice, I might wear it on occasion, however, this was not for me. I put it in three stars because it was just average. I can imagine others might love this but was a pass in my case.",5 Jan 2024,Unique color which might not be universally adored,smilehappyyall1,Anastasia,Lip,No

"I recently had the pleasure of trying the Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet in the shade Parchment, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. From the moment I applied it, I noticed how smoothly it glided on my lips, creating a velvety, matte finish that looked both chic and elegant.

One of the standout features of this product is its staying power. Even after a few hours, the color remained vibrant, and I didn't have to worry about frequent touch-ups. The shade Parchment is a beautiful, versatile color that complements various skin tones. It's become my go-to choice for both daytime and evening looks.

What truly sets this lip product apart is its comfortable wear. Unlike some matte lipsticks that can feel dry and heavy, the Lip Velvet felt lightweight and kept my lips feeling moisturized throughout the day. It didn't settle into fine lines or crack, which is a common concern with matte lip products.

Overall, I highly recommend the Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet, especially in the stunning shade Parchment. It combines long-lasting color, comfort, and a beautiful matte finish, making it a must-have addition to any makeup collection. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed!",5 Jan 2024,Impressed with Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet,snapnpucker1,Anastasia,Lip,No

The sponge tip applicator on this particular color is better than a few of the other colors. It has a almond shaped to it, which helps you shape your lips better if you have irregular lip line. I also like that this one last longer and goes on nice and smoothly. it has great coverage, and can be layered to change the sheerness (less layers can give you a nice, natural terracotta color and more layers can make it progressively darker).

"I have the colors Parchment and Crush. Starting with the pros: The packaging is cute, the applicator gets exactly the amount of product you need and is pointed on top for lining the lips, and the colors are very pigmented. The cons though: given how soft and satiny it is on the lips, it's a little drying and emphasizes lines rather than blurs. It also doesn't dry down so it stays comfortable, but this makes it prone to smudging (I will say the color lasts a while though!)

Overall a decent lippie - the colors read/read a little darker on the skin than they look in the pictures, and I wish there were even more options! I used Parchment over the entire lip with Crush in the center and it was the perfect blend :)

The name is truly accurate here- these lips really feel like velvet with this product! It‚Äôs a soft matte finish that goes on smoothly and wears away just as nicely. I wasn‚Äôt worried about reapplying as often because it takes a while to wear off and when it does it fades naturally and not so unevenly like other lipsticks sometimes do.

"I recently got to try Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet lipstick in the shade ""Crush"" and I am absolutely in love with it! This lipstick has quickly become my go-to for any occasion. 

First of all, the formula is incredibly smooth and creamy. It glides on effortlessly and feels so comfortable on the lips. I have tried many lipsticks in the past, but this one truly stands out in terms of comfort. 

The color payoff is also amazing. The shade ""Crush"" is a beautiful soft beige that suits my skin tone perfectly. It is highly pigmented and provides full coverage with just one swipe. I love how bold and vibrant it looks on my lips. 

What I appreciate the most about this lipstick is its long-lasting formula. It stays put for hours without fading or smudging. I can confidently wear it throughout the day without worrying about touch-ups. Even after eating or drinking, the color stays intact. 

The packaging is also sleek and elegant. The lipstick comes in a sturdy tube with the Anastasia Beverly Hills logo engraved on it. It feels luxurious and high-end, which adds to the overall experience of using the product. 

I must also mention the pleasant scent of the lipstick. It has a subtle vanilla fragrance that is not overpowering. It adds a nice touch to the application process and makes it even more enjoyable. 

In conclusion, I highly recommend the Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet lipstick to anyone who is looking for a high-quality and long-lasting lipstick.
