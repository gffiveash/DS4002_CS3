Omg this product must have been blessed by god himself! Absolutely stunning!!!! Lovely texture and consistency every time. Made my lashes look like im wearing extensions even had people ask where i went to get them done!,02 Feb 2025,Best mascara ever!!,becker41,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"This is one of my favorite mascaras for sure. The shape of the brush is perfect for getting those small lower lashes without getting it all over the under eye area, while giving good volume and coverage for the top lashes, too. There is a little bit of a learning curve to use this one compared to some other brush types to avoid clumping, but it is not difficult to do at all. Once you get the technique down, your lashes will always look bomb! Highly recommend; you will get complimented on your lash game with this for sure.",5 Jan 2025,Favorite!,SwankieTiger,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"I tried to give this mascara the benefit of the doubt, but it was beyond disappointing. I cleaned the brush more than once, but the clumping did not go away.

I love that it dries quicker than most, so i can continue with the rest of my makeup w/o worrying about smearing my mascara.

"This has become a new favourite mascara of mine after receiving it as a stocking stuffer at Christmas ! Now I keep repurchasing it. 
I‚Äôm thinking about getting auto replenish now too! 
I really like that make my lashes look dramatic and bright. 
I thinks it‚Äôs great paired with more of a deep and intense eyeshadow with like dark rich Fall colours and metallics.  Even better with added shimmer on the top lid the eyes too! Then it  really opened up my eyes. I really  think that way my lashes look bigger and fluffier that way , and really highlighting the pupil.
I would prefer to use the mascara mostly on the top of my lashes and another more precise and detailed mascara on the bottom. 
I also gifted Lash Brag to my Mother and now it‚Äôs her favourite too! 
I wonder if they have a dark brown colour , if so I think that could be great doing a more simple , light and sparkly eyeshadow . With the makeup being overall light and minimal, that could help someone if need to make a quick look. I love a bold and dramatic brown mascara with light colours , light neutral tones but also with some smooth pastels too!",5 Aug 2023,Made a Great Stocking Stuffer!

"I absolutely love the volume that this mascara gives my lashes and the way it separates them so perfectly. 

I have rather short, delicate lashes - a combination of straight and curly.  It is important to understand your lash type when shopping for a mascara because not all mascaras are universal for all lash types.  This is why you may see mixed reviews.

There have been a handful of times in my experience with different brands of mascara where I have received unsatisfactory serum consistencies, I then contacted Sephora and received a replacement (this happens from time to time, not a big deal, and does not adequately speak to the product's performance).

This is my lashes with Morphe's blue lash primer and two coats of Anastasia's volumizing mascara.",2 Mar 2023,One of my favourites,DariannaM,Anastasia,Mascara,No
I purchased this product after getting the mini as a sample. I wanted to like it but it smudges under my eye or on my eyelid by the end of the day.

"I love ABD eye shadows and brow products, so I decided to try this mascara. I was SO disappointed! Honestly, this is the worst mascara I've ever used. First of all, it was clumpy and didn't go on nicely or look particularly great on. But the worst part is how much it flaked! It had already started flaking when I looked in the mirror just an hour or so after applying. It continued to flake all day, I started looking like a raccoon. I was so embarrassed I left the house like this. And weirdly, it was super hard to completely remove at the end of the day. It took 3 different eye makeup removers to get it off. You could pick up any cheap drug store mascara and get better results.",26 Jan 2023,Flakes..Flakes EVERYWHERE....!,Ereee,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"I usually hate these eyelash brushes because it is so easy to make your eyelashes into tarantula legs. But, with practice, this mascara gives me way better results than my silicone eyelash brushes ever did. I notice a lot of people go over their eyelashes multiple times, but if you do that with this you're going to get a clumpy mess. one or two times and done.

It clumps all my lashes together no matter how hard I try to separate them. I also get dark marks under my eyes not long after application like I would if I'd been wearing the mascara 10+ hours.

Love the formula and how you can put on a lot of layers and have amazing length for those how have short lashes. But there is one thing I will say I did a two step curling method by using a eyelash curler and curling the base of the lash then curling the tops of the lash. I started doing the two step method for me straight lashes it works but not with all mascara this being one. I'm not disappointed I got the mini just to see it and try it out even though it not keep my lashes in a curl I still want the full size for the layering and formula. 8/10 I would hot again,6 Jun 2022,really good formula but doesn't hold a curl,AnnJacklyn,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"I got this in a set with the Sultry palette and their eyeliner (the price was the same as the palette alone, so why not??), and I gotta say, my expectations were LOW. I'm pretty picky with mascaras, so I was expecting to hate it, or at least feel meh. But actually, it's pretty good! It was GLOOPY at first, but now that it's dried out a little, I like it enough that I'll use up this tube at least.

I'd say it's comparable to Too Faced Better Than Sex‚Äîit even has a similar wand. It's a good combination of volume and length, which gives me the fluffy look I prefer. The color is a nice soft black, and it's able to coat even the little tiny lashes near the inner corner. On me, it doesn't flake or smudge, even if I fall asleep in it. (But I would never do that... of course...) It also stays on and doesn't disappear throughout the day, which is a problem I often have.

The one caveat is that this is the only mascara I've ever found that looks WORSE with a lash primer. I don't know what it is, but my Cils Booster XL makes this clump like crazy‚Äîit's like Younique levels of gross. So don't do that.

"I was initially impressed when I opened this mascara and found the tube's opening small enough that not a ton of product was left on the wand. With a lot of mascaras, I have to blot some product off the wand so it doesn't deposit too much on my lashes. Unfortunately when I used this mascara, it was as if I was using an old, dried up mascara with barely any product on the wand at all. I did not appreciate any volume, length, or curl, and it smudged heavily under my eyes.

"Lovely mascara, makes lashes look longer and fuller. I have a terrible time with most mascaras because they tend to rub off after a few hours and leave me looking like a raccoon (thank you oily lids and watery eyes!).

I was looking for a replacement for the discontinued Bobbi Brown Extreme Party Mascara - low/no flake and able to build layers.   This formula was only ok on flaking.

received complimentary for testing purposes from ABH and influenster. I was super excited to try this as I am someone who loves mascara. I won't lie when i saw the brush i was expecting it to be similar to Too faced better than sex. After nearly 2 weeks of trying this product i think it's okay. At first application after working with it a bit my lashes look great! super long + and full but i found them to sort of fall by the end of the day along with there being a lot of specks of mascara fallout under my eyes which is why i give it the rating of 3 stars i think its good but it definitely does need some type of formula improvement. I love the packaging and there isn't really a distinct sent to the product. The price is average of any other branded mascara you'll find in ulta and sephora but because of the performance i do not think it is worth it and wouldn't repurchase.

"I struggled between 4 + 3 stars for this because I only have one issue with it but I ended up saying three because I guess I expected more from this brand. 

The formula with initial application is great . It‚Äôs very black, separates your lashes the right way, isn‚Äôt too clumpy but is still dramatic . I usually only need two coats . 

My issue is that once it is dry , throughout the day it flakes . So much that I get it in my eye + also sheds flakes (but doesn‚Äôt smudge) on my under eyes . Kinda lame . 
Will still use it til it‚Äôs gone though because other than that it‚Äôs good , + I just make sure to have a light set under my eyes and will brush off fallout through out the day with a small makeup brush .",2 May 2020,Good but not great.,alexiamaxine,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"Unfortunately, this mascara isn‚Äôt the one for me because of one simple reason - the wand.

The formula is volumizing. The staying power is wonderful - no flakes at the end of the day - which is a big deal for me! 

...but the wand. The WAND. It looks a lot like the one that comes in Too Faced BTS. Perhaps if the formula was a little dryer it would work okay (I have been using this for WEEKS in hopes that the formula drying out a little bit would help - it hasn‚Äôt), but the wand simply doesn‚Äôt separate the lashes. They all stick together.

I have tried applying this with the original wand, then going over it with a different wand (spikey, rubbery) to separate the lashes an it looked great‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt want to have to use two wands to do my mascara.",22 Apr 2020,NOT FOR ME,aperry101,Anastasia,Mascara,No

As for the actual product- I recommend wiping off a lot of the excess product before applying, as its extremely volumizing. A little goes a LONG way and this is very easy to build.

"This mascara definitely does its job! To start off, beautiful packaging. Feels nice and heavy as well as it just has the most gorgeous rose gold ombr√©. It does have more of a fluffier brush, which isn‚Äôt my favorite. HOWEVER- my eyelashes do be poppin after I put on a coat of this! With fluffy brushed mascara, I tend to get some fallout in my eye.. and this is no exception. But beauty is pain- and this stuff makes your lashes beautiful!",16 Apr 2020,Pros and Cons,flamelia,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"I was so excited to try the new, first ever, Anastasia Beverly Hills Lash Brag Volumizing mascara because I love the ABH brand and hoped that I'd also love their mascara. They did not disappoint! I found my new go-to mascara! It comes with a nice thick hourglass applicator brush which I love because it applies thick even coats to both the top and the bottom. It produces a dramatic look with just 1-2 coats and makes my eyes look awake and wider. It's long lasting all day without flakes. The packaging is a modern attractive design. I'm giving my honest opinion on this product. I will definitely be purchasing this item in the future!",13 Apr 2020,Mascara doesn't dissappoint!!,ShaeShaeN,Anastasia,Mascara,No
I wasn‚Äôt too crazy about this mascara. The brush is big and has a lot of bristles which you would think is a good thing but I‚Äôve found that it puts too much product on the wand and makes my eyelashes clump together. I found that the product would fall to my under eyes as the day went on.,13 Apr 2020,,jamgren,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I think overall this mascara was good. The brush is great and doesn‚Äôt cause clumping, it coats the lashes evenly.  This gave my lashes a nice curl and it‚Äôs easy to layer.  My only Negative about this mascara is that it does tend to flake a little as the day goes on,  it other than that I really liked it!",13 Apr 2020,,GA19,Anastasia,Mascara,No
This mascara really had a way of coating each lash. It didn‚Äôt clump easy and it was buildable for the most part. More than three coats started clumping for me but that‚Äôs understandable. It definitely gave you the look of having falsies. I would certainly purchase again.,13 Apr 2020,Falsies?!,Raemarcam,Anastasia,Mascara,No

It's a good mascara that goes on nicely and is definitely black as to where some others can look a little grey. My only problem is that it is a little clumpy. I take a clean wand and fix this but it does suck and makes it take a little longer to put one. Other then that I do really like this product.,13 Apr 2020,,angieisamess,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I received this mascara free to test and I really liked it! It made my lashes look longer and fuller without feeling clumpy. My eyes did get a little itchy wearing it the first time, but I‚Äôve worn it several times since and not had an issue. The only downside is sometimes I like to layer my mascaras, and for whatever reason this one did not play well with others.",12 Apr 2020,,TaraTriesIt,Anastasia,Mascara,No
It‚Äôs a good mascara. One coat gives you a nice natural look. You definitely need to build up for the desired affect. I personally like a bolder lash. The formula is on the drier side so it does get clumpy. The wand is similar to the top faced better than sex mascara or L‚ÄôOreal lash paradise (I prefer the larger style wand). Packaging is beautiful and luxurious. All in all it‚Äôs a good product but nothing revolutionary.,12 Apr 2020,Good mascara,Jcor89,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"Love this mascara. Clearly defines and lengthens upper and lower lashes. My main complaint is that it can be a bit clumpy at times, there‚Äôs almost too much product on the applicator.

Does not volumize! Also it made my lashes sage... they did NOT stay curled. Very disappointed in this product.,12 Apr 2020,Horrible!,alexfschell,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I love this mascara!! It feels so lightweight but gives your lashes the volume they crave.  Even after one coat, your lashes are ready to go.  I think the only ‚Äúdownside‚Äù would be the price but it is definitely worth it in my opinion.",12 Apr 2020,Love love love!!,em1ll1e,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"First, the packaging is amazing! It‚Äôs stunning to look at and has a nice weight to it. The wand has the popular hourglass shape and the bristles do a good job at coating every lash. The formula is amazing at both volumizing and lengthening, doesn‚Äôt clump, and holds a curl. Unfortunately, it flakes. When I first got this product there were also big globs of product on the wand and the opening of the tube, but it is no longer an issue after a few uses. Overall this mascara is really good, but it‚Äôs worth getting on a sale if flaking is a dealbreaker.",11 Apr 2020,So close to perfection,mimipoo,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I received this product at no cost for review purposes. So, first, the tube is heavy enough to carry around as a self-defense tool. Upon first opening the tube, the mascara was pretty gloppy. After cleaning up the wand a bit, it went on easily but still a bit clumpy. I cleaned it up a bit with a lash comb, and I was good to go. My top lashes are stick straight, so I had to curl them to see the volume, but my eyelashes definitely looked more voluminous.",11 Apr 2020,,JessicaMailo,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"After trying this mascara for a few weeks I can say I truly tried to like it. It actually went on smoothly and my lashes looked really nice, but within an hour or two it smudged and looked like I had taken a shower in it. 
I know I live in Florida and it‚Äôs a little humid, but this formula is not long Lasting enough to even get through a day. After two to three hours it looks a mess! It almost looked like I had cried or something, it completely melted and moved around on my eyes.

"This mascara is great for long lasting and it made my lashes look very full. Honestly the only reason I didn‚Äôt give it five stars is because of how heavy the packaging is. But, the actually formula of the product I have nothing bad to say.",9 Apr 2020,Mascara,marisabrave,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"The packaging for this mascara is very nice! It‚Äôs heavy and feels/looks more luxurious than other mascara brands. However the product itself is just mediocre.  When you remove the wand the bristles are COVERED in mascara To the point where half of the bristles don‚Äôt show. After trying to make it work for a week I had to swipe the wand through a tissue and waste product to help the issue.
 The mascara for me got clumpy easily and would transfer to my upper eye area and under eye which doesn‚Äôt happen with other non waterproof  mascaras for me. 
I think It has potential, just could use some tweaking in my opinion. 

I received this product complimentary for my honest review.",8 Apr 2020,Just okay,kassiemariedahl,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"The thing I like the most about this mascara is the tube it comes in. All in all it‚Äôs an okay mascara, but I think there are just better ones out there. This can get clumpy fast if you use too much. It doesn‚Äôt give my lashes a curl and it flakes some. I can get my lashes to look nice with it but I feel like I have to work for it.",8 Apr 2020,,Taradactyl56,Anastasia,Mascara,No
Been looking for a volumizing and lengthening mascara since I had my lash extensions taken off. Saw Jeffree Starr review this so I decided to buy it. It really does give you volume and length plus you can layer it and it doesn‚Äôt clump up.

"I really like this mascara. The packaging is pretty, it‚Äôs quite heavy, which I like in a mascara. When it‚Äôs too light and flimsy it feels cheap...This one has nice weight to it, it‚Äôs luxe, and I love the rose gold colour too. The wand is nice, I like the bristles as they really grab on and coat each individual lash. It‚Äôs dark, a little volumizing, but more lengthening than anything, which I prefer.

"This mascara checks off several ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù for me. The brush is in my favorite shape, an hour glass, which is great for achieving maximum volume and evenly coating lashes at the corners of the eye. The formula is on the thicker side, which I appreciate in a volumizing mascara, and it is jet black. Wear time is reasonable - I tend to only notice transfer to my under eyes after +8 hours of wear. One coat gives me a beautifully full ‚Äúdaytime‚Äù lash look. I have noticed that if I try to apply more than one coat, the mascara clumps easily if I am not careful. As a bonus, the packaging is incredible - the tube feels opulently heavy and screws/unscrews perfectly smoothly. Overall, this is a nice mascara, but I find it to be on the expensive side for simply being ‚Äúnice.‚Äù

I naturally have long, curled eyelashes and when I look for a new mascara I try to find one that separates and gives a good amount of volume. This mascara really hit the spot. However I did notice that by the end of the day I had really bad fall out and I had some family members comment on this. That is the reason for one star removed. But all in all this is a great everyday mascara and you don‚Äôt have to put many coats on for it to look good. I usually apply about 2 coats per upper and lower lash to get the look I‚Äôm going for.",3 Apr 2020,,hsconover,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"Packaging & component is sleek and beautiful This one seems to be similar to the Better than Sex mascara, but not as wet and clumpy. It does provide lengthening and volumizing, and does provide some slight lash separation.

The formula is a little thick but glides on and doesn't look clumpy. I wore it when I left the house to do pick up groceries (hello quarantine 2020), and the girl said she loved my lashes!

"This mascara has easily become my second favorite ""luxury"" mascaras. I don't usually like spending more than $10 for a mascara, but I will defiantly make the exception for Lash Brag. It's gives me volume, curl, length, and it is a true black color. I will say, one coat is NOT enough. You definitely need two or three coats to get the best results. I really loved the way Too Faced's Better Than Sex mascara made my eyelashes look, but within an hour it would always run & it was super clumpy. So THIS one is all the best things of Better Than Sex without any of the bad stuff. 

The only cons are the price & the wand it pretty big, so when applying it to your lower lash you have to be very careful.

I really love this mascara although it‚Äôs not waterproof. I love the brush. If you use to much it will clump. I did receive this free to test.,1 Apr 2020,,BrandiWeese,Anastasia,Mascara,No
I really liked this product. My lashes looked long and full of volume after just 1 coat. What I loved about it the most was that my lashes looked so natural and there was absolutely no clumping and my lashes felt lightweight even after applying several coats of the product; like I had no product on them at all. I recommend this product to anyone.,1 Apr 2020,"Beautiful, volumized lashes",nini1922,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I would say this mascara is ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù in my opinion. It boils down to it being too clumpy for me. The brush is really similar to the Better Than Sex wand, but something about this formula makes it clump really badly. I mean it definitely provides volume, but I prefer volume without the expense of my lashes all sticking together to make 4 big ones on each eye. Maybe I‚Äôm being dramatic, but that‚Äôs how I feel about it.",1 Apr 2020,Just ok,emnick93,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"I initially wrote a review but I‚Äôve changed my mind on overall review. 
Purchased the mini tube after purchasing the large tube. Sometimes the mini tubes are different vs large. I love this mascara. It‚Äôs my absolute favorite to date. Gives my lashes maximum length and adds volume. Moderate volume and fullness. It also separates my lashes without all the clump. I‚Äôm applying two coats, maybe three at times. Love the look of my long lashes! First application lifts and lengthens my lashes. When I first purchased and used the large tube mascara it wasn‚Äôt holding a curl. But after using the mini no more issues. And I started using the large tube again and have not had any issues with holding a curl. Not certain what that was all about. It does deposit lots of mascara on wand after continued use so I do have to wipe it off the brush but it‚Äôs absolutely a 5 star mascara.",1 Apr 2020,New favorite,boww,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"Great mascara! Big lashes that really stood out, but didn't look fake. Watch out when you are applying because I noticed that this mascara formula can clump if you aren't careful. The wand is a typical shape that I see on many of the mascaras I enjoy. Give it a try, I definitely love wearing it, especially for a night out!",1 Apr 2020,,VictoriaElgersm,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"This mascara is amazing. I have naturally long lashes with no curl. This mascara gives you curl, thickness, fullness, length, and separation. The wand is similar to the Too Faced Better Than Sex and the L‚ÄôOreal Lash Paradise, however, I feel that the formula for this mascara is much better. The Anastasia and L‚ÄôOreal tend to clump, but I find that this mascara does not clump no matter how many layers I put on. It is very buildable, however, I really only need one coat her lash to give me what I need. It gives me the perfect false lash effect. It‚Äôs long lasting and the curl doesn‚Äôt fall which is a huge plus, as a lot of mascaras tend to weight my lashes down after a while. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the wand is quite big, so you have to be very careful because it‚Äôs very easy to get mascara all over your eyelid. It‚Äôs not the end of the world, however, I don‚Äôt usually enjoy being cautious with my mascara application (I like to wiggle the wand around and mess around with my lashes a bit). It makes it hard for it to be a good ‚Äúevery day mascara‚Äù, however, if you‚Äôre like me and you don‚Äôt usually use eyeshadow on a daily basis, you could easily just put the mascara on and clean up your eyelids after. Otherwise, you want to be Ôøºcareful when applying. Nevertheless this mascara is still amazing and I can‚Äôt get enough of it. I‚Äôve had SOOOO many people compliment me and ask what mascara I‚Äôm using! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",1 Apr 2020,AMAZING!! just a little messy,krysassy,Anastasia,Mascara,No
This mascara is like any other average mascara imho. It didn‚Äôt seem to add any volume as advertised. The packaging is heavy and expensive which is what you‚Äôre probably paying for because the product itself is no better than any drugstore mascara. 3 stars for beautiful packaging.,1 Apr 2020,Average and not noteworthy,fleur4her,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"This was a pretty good on first use! It made my lashes long, separated, and black. However, it did smudge a bit. In a non waterproof mascara, I prefer no smudges. It did keep my lashes curled all day. However, it became very thick after first use and the formula is very clumpy. It made it very hard to get the same look that I did the first time.

While it does make my lashes longer and fuller I did not like it after a while. It clumps together and flakes off into my eyes and under my eyes. I'll stick to my other mascara. This one is not my favorite. Used it for 2 weeks and always the same result.,1 Apr 2020,Clumpy and flakey,Hanstan,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I really loved using this mascara and would absolutely purchase it. I have naturally dark lashes, but this accentuated that further. This formula didn‚Äôt clump, it wasn‚Äôt flaky, it wasn‚Äôt hard to use, and the shape of the brush made it easy to apply (and also not get mascara on my lids)! For comparison, my favorite mascara is Too Faced‚Äôs Better Than Sex, and I think this really holds up! It stays on, and it‚Äôs not super wet on application (which is an issue I sometimes have with BTS and getting mascara on my lids). Bonus: the packaging is absolutely gorgeous. I love just looking at the tube.",1 Apr 2020,Definitely worth a try!,thecheshiregirl,Anastasia,Mascara,No

I am actually very pleased with this mascara. I don‚Äôt usually like these type of wands because they always have way too much product on them but not with this one.

I was sent this product for testing purposes. I really liked the mascara! It added a lot of volume to my lashes without making them too thick or clumpy.

I have used a lot of drugstore products that are super comparable,31 Mar 2020,Try it!,Kbiggs3,Anastasia,Mascara,No
I wish I would have discovered this sooner! I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I'm so glad I did. This is definitely my new favorite for buildable volume.

It doesn‚Äôt smudge, doesn‚Äôt flake, makes my lashes look INCREDIBLE, feels good all day long, has the most beautiful packaging, and is at a price point I would be willing to pay again and again!

"This mascara is ok. It‚Äôs a bit clumpy and I‚Äôm really not a fan of the ‚Äúhourglass‚Äù shape of the wand. All that does is leave a blank space in the middle of my lashes while each side have mascara on them. Maybe I‚Äôm doing it wrong. 
I also don‚Äôt think it adds much fullness.",31 Mar 2020,Just ok,flutiefan,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I waited until I had used this mascara at least ten times before I could write an honest review. 

- This mascara is packaged well the design the weight it‚Äôs beautiful. 
- I like the weight of brush handle in my hand when applying the mascara. 
- I like the concave shape of the actually application brush bristles. 
- The consistency of the mascara is thick and always comes out clumpy when I apply it. I have tried fully cleaning it with a makeup wipe but no matter what I do it‚Äôs clumpy. I‚Äôm able to blot of the excess with my fingers so it looks good. 
- The actual mascara lasts all day and doesn‚Äôt smudge or run down your face if you cry or get oily. 
- If they could fix the clumpy application possibly thin out the consistency this has potential to be my new holy grail mascara. 
- I only give honest reviews so I‚Äôll say I like the product very much but due to the clumping and the time it takes me to blot it off I only use this one  when I have extra time. 

Lastly, I would like to thank Anastasia Beverly Hills and Influenster so very much for selecting me to try this product as I am a huge fan of ABH. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",31 Mar 2020,,allicat75,Anastasia,Mascara,No
I loved the jet black color of this mascara! The formula is nice and 2 costs really does add extra length and thickness to my lashes.

I notice that it does what it says...provides volume. I also notice that it lengthens which is nice. The color is very black so your lashes are noticeable.

"I thought this mascara was pretty good, the bottle is beautiful and great quality, it has a good weight to it. The texture seemed smooth at first but the more you put the brush in and out of the bottle it starts to build up at the top and clump. The look of the brush with the hourglass shape was easy to use and added lift with the curves. I tested this with one, two, and three coats, the first coat is simple and adds a little lift to your lashes and separates them the second gave a little more volume and started to thicken the appearance and I enjoyed the third coast because I noticed more volume and looked thicker, kind of like false lashes but seems easy to clump together if your not careful applying it and I also noticed it was flaking throughout the day which was disappointing but my overall impression of this is pretty great and worth the price.

"This is pure crap. Just got it and was so excited to try... let down 100%. First off, the tube needs help. When dipping it in & out, so much product gets stuck on the rim aka wasted. On my lashes, ugh, spider lashes to say the least. It super clumpy, legit extra wet and disgusting. No consistency. Total return when the stores open again. Anastasia should stick to brows. Sorry not sorry. Eww",28 Mar 2020,Anastasia should stick to brows,CoJess,Anastasia,Mascara,No
This mascara is great at volumizing without feeling heavy! Be careful with the hourglass shape because the tip may cause some eyelashes to stick together and you‚Äôll need to separate after. This has become my new go-to and I‚Äôd highly recommend for the natural voluminous wispy look!,28 Mar 2020,,chloeb1,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"Such a good mascara! I tried the product for a month before I wrote a review and here are my thoughts: 1. it lasts all day without flaking; 2. it is easy to take off; 3. Easy to build up without getting too clumpy; 3. Very wet product; 4. Easy to take off; 5. It will smear a bit when you sweat. 

Overall, I think it is a really good mascara but I wouldn't recommend it to the girls who prefer a dry formula.",28 Mar 2020,,SHoward6174,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"Amazing!! First off the packaging is beautiful and it feels heavy therefore makes it seem more luxurious. The formula is really nice you only need about 3 swipes like it says! After those few swipes you have long, full, flame free lashes. Usually with other mascaras I‚Äôm brushing it through multiple times but with this I didn‚Äôt feel the need to do that. This is my first time trying any ABH mascara but I loved it so I‚Äôll definitely be checking out their other items!",27 Mar 2020,,kyla0,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"I knew Anastasia did brows right...now it was time to test lashes!  The Anastasia Lash Brag volumizing m√°scara does just that!  It gives you fantastic volume from swipe one. As soon as I opened mine, I noticed how thick the formula was. No waiting for mascara to ‚Äúdry down‚Äù to that perfect texture. The formula alongside the incredibly thick and shapely brush helped to separate, volumize and lengthen. My lashes were still soft so I had no issues with breakage. As a healthcare employee, I put my makeup to the test. 13 hour wear and my lashes were still full and looking fresh. The formula is also nice and dark for my brunette lashes. Long lasting but easy to remove with my facial soap or oil balm. The packaging is slick and very weighty. Feel luxurious. Found a winner!",27 Mar 2020,,dvinerevelation,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"LOVING this mascara! Gives length and volume. Not a super wet formula yet not dry. It's in between. Easy to do several coats. In my pic, I only had one coat on.

"Lash Brag is amazing! It is dark and really builds the volume and length of my lashes. I usually just do one coat (cause I‚Äôm lazy!) but it looked amazing with just one. If you do more than one, it looks even more amazing. I usually wear falsies and this made it possible to give my eyes a break from falsies. Didn‚Äôt flake and lasted me 12+ hours! Would rebuy and recommend :)",27 Mar 2020,Love it!,laylabrooke,Anastasia,Mascara,No
I have mixed feelings towards this mascara. Yes it gives volume to my eyelashes but it also weighs them down after a while so I end up with raccoon eyes . The wand also picks up too much product,27 Mar 2020,,marianaxo16,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"This product is pretty nice. I love the packaging, it‚Äôs super heavy and durable. The pigment is wonderful and I like the shape of the wand.

I have mixed feelings about this mascara. Although I can get my lashes to look nice it takes a lot of work. The wand picks up so much product that I have to wipe so much off before applying or it become a very clumpy situation. Once doing that however it does look very nice. This might be because it still hasn‚Äôt dried out as much yet. I liked the shape of the wand I just wish it didn‚Äôt pick up so much product.,27 Mar 2020,,samcanciobello,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"Overall a good volumizing mascara. I love the packaging - very sleek and heavy. The mascara itself is thick and can‚Äôt get a little clumpy if you‚Äôre not careful.

For everyone saying there‚Äôs too much product on the brush I received my mascara complimentary through voxbox and it came with instructions saying to scrap off the excess product. I didn‚Äôt realize this at first and i didn‚Äôt like the application but after reading the instructions it says to do that then to also do one coat over the top of the lashes. it made a ton of a difference! The pigment is great and i saw a huge difference after only one application.i don‚Äôt recommend doing more than 2 coats though! it got a bit too clumpy for my personal liking.,27 Mar 2020,You just have to follow the directions!,tmallen95,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I think this mascara is very similar to Better Than Sex (BTS) by Too Faced. Everything about it reminds me of BTS - the packaging, shape of the wand, and formula. I do think the formula is a bit thinner than BTS. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars is because I do have a difficult time separating my lashes the way I‚Äôd like to with it. The packaging is really nice and there isn‚Äôt a strong fragrance to the product, which I really appreciate!

"ABH is everything, but this mascara isnt my favorite. It does makes my lashes look darker and and they aren‚Äôt horribly clumpy. I would say that theres almost too much product in the tube, I cant seem to scrape enough off the wand to not end up with super clumpy chunks still left on the wand. I do end up taking a spoolie to kind of then the lashes out a little more. The description is pretty accurate, you really only need one coat.",27 Mar 2020,,cspz,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"As you can see, one coat alone does the job. I did try doing multiple coats - in my opinion it does start to look very clumpy after one. You can probably get away with two coats, but I would stop there. The hourglass shaped brush does pack on the pigment and the bristles do help to comb and separate each lash. I found the brush is hard for me to work with though - I ended up getting mascara on my lid trying to brush out the lashes to achieve the separation. It‚Äôs almost like I needed a clean wand to really brush them out and get my desired look without getting too messy. They recommend starting on your lower lashes after wiping excess product onto inner rim of tube, and moving on to the top lashes after that - personally I feel it is not best to start there as too much product would be deposited on the lower lash. Overall, it is a nice mascara, but doesn‚Äôt earn a spot in my top faves of all time. I recommend starting with the travel size if you‚Äôre interested :)",26 Mar 2020,decent mascara,lipsticknlunges,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this brand and have so much respect for it. I use several of their products and think they are excellent. However I was not very impressed with this mascara. I really really wanted to like it! The packaging was beautiful and the mascara itself felt heavy when holding it and looked premium. But every time I have used it there have been clumps of black in the brush and on my eyelashes after using it.  There has only been one time that I‚Äôve used it and successfully had great looking lashes. Every other time I have used it I have ended up with clumps of black goo in my eyelashes, and it‚Äôs been difficult to get out. I hope they rework their formula and fix this glitch.

"So I have a bit of a dilemma with this product. On one hand it‚Äôs amazing. It made my lashes super full, distributed a lot of product on my lashes, and didn‚Äôt flake.

I would absolutely love this product if it didn‚Äôt have all of the packaging issues.",26 Mar 2020,,Mads712,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"In LOVE with this mascara.  One coat provides such volume, meanwhile with other mascaras I have to apply multiple coats to get that same level of volume.

All opinions are my own.",25 Mar 2020,Amazing product!!,britnymillz,Anastasia,Mascara,No

I'll wear 1 coat for work, then just add a couple more if I am going out afterwards creating a bolder look. I wipe the excess mascara on the bottle before I apply, so it didnt clump.

"I teetered on the verge of a 3-4 star for this one. Although I love ABH products, this mascara has been a slight disappointment. I like that it is volumnizing, however, it is not lengthening at all. I need lengthening due to my long, fine and fair lashes to extend them out. This mascara does not seem to catch the ends to enhance length, so it‚Äôs not very multifaceted in that respect. Also, it tends to fade under my lower lash line and undereye area so it looks like I have smudging or a black eye. I think it‚Äôs a bit fiber-ish, which causes it to ‚Äúshed‚Äù from my lashes and this leads to the smudging. I wouldn‚Äôt probably purchase it on my own once I‚Äôve used this one for those reasons alone.

"This product was sent to be complimentary from Influenster and I‚Äôve been testing it out over the last couple of weeks. I love the brush on it, it fits perfectly to my lashes and it‚Äôs not too big. It separates my lashes nicely and adds some length to them. My lashes look for voluminous after applying.

"I received this product free for testing from Influenster, but if I hadn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know if I would pay the price ABH is selling it for. That being said, I reaaaally enjoy this mascara!

From first impression, the packaging is very luxe, it‚Äôs heavy and sturdy. The wand reminds me of the Too Faced Better than Sex wand, very fluffy and not a rubber wand; but I find I like this formula better. Unlike Better than Sex, this mascara doesn‚Äôt flake off. This is more of a drier formula, but not too dry. Also, this mascara builds really nicely. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily give me the length that I want, but it does give great volume (I‚Äôm not mad about it not really lengthening because it‚Äôs a bikini zing mascara) 

I gave it 4 stars just because of the price point. I would recommend trying it if you‚Äôre into high end mascaras. Once again, I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",23 Mar 2020,Great! but not life changing.,jessicaa907,Anastasia,Mascara,No
I bought the small size of this mascara because I‚Äôve been using rollerball for years and it‚Äôs definitely my go to but I wanted to try it. I generally like a mascara where the bristles are more plastic for better control but this one is your typical softer bristles. I was surprised when I put it on and it wasn‚Äôt clumpy. It applied really well and even surprisingly well on the bottom lashes. I deducted one starbecause it feels like there‚Äôs barely any product on the tube that I received. Will continue to use,23 Mar 2020,better than I thought,PatriciaSardo,Anastasia,Mascara,No
This mascara is so good!!! It made my lashes really black and really helped lift them. The packaging is freaking gorgeous and it feels like a really high end product.

"So I‚Äôm already a big fan of Anastasia Beverly Hills products. I was so very excited when I found out I was receiving this product. So I have done lash extensions in the past which has of course damaged my lashes from repeated applications and removal of extensionsÔøºÔøº. And even then this product was able to shine, adding length and volume without clumpingÔøºÔøº. The applicator allowed for an increase in volume even in the corner of my eye. The formula is extremely smooth and glides on easy to lashesÔøºÔøº. The box and the container are very cute and definitely feels heavy which is nice.Ôøº I am very pleased with the product.

"I think this mascara is nice because it can really put on some thick layers, you just have to be careful because it can clump pretty easily.

I wanted to love this mascara but it wasn‚Äôt a winner for me. I have short sparse blonde lashes and need a bad A mascara to get the job done.

"Wow- first time I wore this mascara I was asked if I just had my lashes done!! Second time, same thing! Literally the nicest compliment. This mascara is highly pigmented with a heavy duty brush.

I would absolutely recommend this!",23 Mar 2020,Compliment City!,MWildman,Anastasia,Mascara,No

I am enjoying this mascara. The wand is heavy duty and for me that is really nice! The formula is nice and works well with my straight lashes. I would recommend this mascara! It doesnt clump or flake which is a plus. It did smudge under the eyes a bit when I used with a heavier under eye moisturizer. So if you use a heavier eye cream let that sit for awhile before applying mascara. It does have a luxury feel when using it which is another thing I enjoyed,23 Mar 2020,,Nicmikey,Anastasia,Mascara,No
This product is super black and added a ton of volume and length to my lashes. I prefer applying one coat and letting it dry and adding a second coat for a flash lash effect.

"I love this mascara, i think it‚Äôs awesome and it‚Äôs my first time using any Anastasia product, so i‚Äôm pleasantly surprised! I love how black the pigmentation is, the hourglass wand makes for easy application, the packaging is gorgeous and sleek for easily traveling, and it adds so much volume, dimension, and length to your lashes. When my mom saw me wearing this mascara she thought I had on falsies if that says anything! My only con with this mascara is the price point is a little too expensive as well as it does get a little clumpy on the lashes. It is also really hard to take off at the end of the night, which is good and bad. It does flake off a little bit too as you wear it. Overall, it‚Äôs a great mascara and i do recommend it! Also, pro tip is to do about two to three coats to get the desired volume, as well as swipe it on your lashes by blinking into the wand.",22 Mar 2020,,ginachech,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"I received this product from Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes but all reviews are 100% my own. When I received my package the first thing I noticed was how nice the tube felt and looked. I liked that it has a weighted feel to it than just a cheap plastic feel. I also love how shiny it is! Now moving onto the product itself. I first tried this when I had to do some simple errands thinking a little bit of mascara wouldn‚Äôt hurt. I normally love a heavy dramatic look but this time I was trying to be more simple.  Even with the first coat I noticed how long and beautiful my lashes looked. I was trying to go for a more simple look but I honestly didn‚Äôt mind how much definition it added! I then decided to go for the three coats like it said and I loved how it looked like I was wearing some falsies!  It stayed on pretty well and didn‚Äôt flake all over the place like most mascaras. I have some sensitive lashes to and certain mascaras make my lashes itchy and I can just feel it being heavy as well. With this product I hardly could tell I was wearing any mascara considering how dramatic it looked, but overall I loved it! I do plan on purchasing this product sometime in the near future and yes I do highly recommend! I hope it works out for you as much as it did for me!",22 Mar 2020,Lash dramatic!,JennD94,Anastasia,Mascara,No

My lashes appear thicker and longer so I definitely love the way it looks when on.  The ONLY reason I am giving 4 stars is- I noticed it does start to flake off after an hour or so.

I really love the way this mascara makes my lashes look so full. The packaging is also pretty lux which is a nice bonus. I am a big fan of hourglass shaped brushes so that worked nicely for my lashes as well. My only issue is the formula does get a little bit clumpy and I can feel it in the corner of my eye especially until it‚Äôs dry which is annoying. If I run a clean spoiler through my lashes after applying it does lessen this issue though.

"I received this product for free and was skeptical at first. After opening the luxurious looking package I was surprised to find a beautiful, yet quote large, metal tube. The dumbbell-shapes brush has lots of long bristles which makes it super easy to separate your lashes when there isn‚Äôt too much product on the brush. I don‚Äôt love how thick the formula is since it can get clumpy, but the brush really makes up for it. I could see a significant improvement in my lashes after only a couple swipes! For an even more dramatic look, this mascara is conveniently buildable and you can add more layers. The one true negative aspect of this product is that I find it doesn‚Äôt hold a curl well, which I attribute to it not being waterproof. However it does give lashes a lot of volume so this is not a critical part of the mascara here.

Some pros: it looks beautiful upon application, and gives length & volume without being clumpy. It‚Äôs the least clumpy mascara I‚Äôve ever used‚ÄîNO clumps. The packaging is also gorgeous and quite heavy/luxe feeling. However, the cons outweigh the pros here. It doesn‚Äôt hold a curl, which I attribute to it not being waterproof. It also wears off very quickly, and ends up smearing all over the place. I had mascara under my eyes SO badly and even smudged on my eyelid. Very very smudgy. If ABH comes out with this in a waterproof formula I‚Äôd be excited to try it because it might be much more wearable.

I use their brow products and own most of their palettes, so when I was given a chance to review this mascara I was overjoyed. However, I was disappointed in this mascara. Its hourglass shape wand isn‚Äôt anything new, but the packaging is very pretty. Whenever I pull the wand out of the tube, a lot of product comes out and gets wasted.

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I absolutely loved this mascara. I think it‚Äôs perfect with just two coats for an every day use. If you like it more dramatic for a night out, I‚Äôd go for three coats. The reason I gave this mascara 4 stars instead of 5 is because the third coat does get clumpy. It doesn‚Äôt look all that bad though. The mascara lasts all day and is easy to clean off. All in all great product.",19 Mar 2020,Love this product!,AshElizabeth07,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"This is one of the best mascaras I have used in a very long time. It is not an overly dry or wet formula, making it very volumizing and lengthening without being clumpy or transferring or flaking. I wear false lashes on a regular basis, but I have stopped wearing them as often because of how long and fluffy this mascara makes my lashes look as well as the incredible wear time! It doesn‚Äôt feel heavy in any way and is a deep jet black making is such a fantastic formula!",19 Mar 2020,the best high end mascara!,meenarose,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"The instructions for this mascara say that you should apply max three coats and that's definitely true as any more then three coats clumps up. However you don't need more then three coats as it gives a lot of length and volume. It's definitely not a beginner mascara but it's beautiful, jet black and wears really well.",19 Mar 2020,,MeiraS,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"I‚Äôm in love with this mascara. There‚Äôs really no other way to put it. I work at Sephora as a beauty advisor and therefore have tried almost every mascara in the store and this one is definitely my favorite. I love the shape of the wand and the formula is unmatched by others I have tried. It‚Äôs wet enough to thoroughly coat each lash but not so wet that it ends up all over my eyelid. It can give a more natural or a more dramatic look. Basically whatever you want, this mascara can do.",19 Mar 2020,Holy guacamole,Glittaprincess,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"Um, I was for sure not expecting how good this mascara actually is! The formula does exactly what it claims which is time volumize your lashes!

I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",19 Mar 2020,A surprising Must have!,Ozmara,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"Right off the bat, the packaging is absolutely gorgeous. I love how heavy and sturdy it is; it feels really expensive. The applicator is well-designed, too. Whenever I put on the mascara, I am blown away by how curled my lashes become. It‚Äôs also easy to apply to all of my lashes. The formula leaves a lot of room for improvement, however. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a multitude of clumps; depending on the day, they can be almost impossible to work with or nonexistent. A lot of mascara has gathered around the rim of the bottle since I first used it. This product flaw makes the product frustrating to work with. I usually can work with the mascara after its on my lashes (it takes a bit to dry) and get out the clumps with a comb, but I‚Äôd rather not have to do that, and especially not when I‚Äôm in a rush. On the plus side, the formula is nice and dark, with only a little fallout from a day‚Äôs use. It adds incredible length and decent volume to lashes. Now, down to the summary: is it a good mascara? Despite its clumping problem, this mascara performs really well, and for that, I enjoy using it. But would I pay $25 for it? No, I feel that other similarly-priced mascaras outdo this one. Still, I‚Äôm super happy I‚Äôve received this product and will use it until I‚Äôm out.",18 Mar 2020,,eliyanave,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"Overall it‚Äôs a great mascara ladies! The packaging was cute & I noticed the mascara felt heavy compared to most. It definitely is jet black which I love!! It lengthened and volumized my lashes, one coat looked natural and volumized but I like a dramatic look so I applied more coats. Only problem I had was some flaking throughout the day & there‚Äôs some better drug store mascaras compared to this one for the price of this one but it‚Äôs really a amazing mascara if you need length and volume which we ladies want that lol I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",18 Mar 2020,,Izzyroseeee,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"Volume is amazing with this! However, the brush immediately out of the tube is clumpy as well as the application. Takes a bit of finesse.

"I have a hard time finding mascara, my lashes are long and grow in every direction. This mascara tames them and makes them look nice and full at the same time. I personally didn‚Äôt notice the length (my lashes are already pretty long) but my roommate looked at them and she said she noticed a big difference. A couple of things to keep in mind is that it is on the thicker side so I takes time to dry.... I also would not recommend 3 coats as the packaging it comes in does, 2 does the trick just fine. The only reason I‚Äôm not giving 5 stars is because it does leave some fallout under the eye which if you are going to a natural look completely ruins. If you are into smoky eyes and use eyeliner under you eye, you won‚Äôt notice the fall out that much.",18 Mar 2020,,Maggie0930,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I LOVE this product - if you are interested in length and volume, this is one of the best. The packaging is heavy and feels luxurious. Just takes swipe or two to apply evenly.

Really quality product",18 Mar 2020,Long and voluminous lashes,sarahkate22,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I got this from influencer and tbh I hate it. It‚Äôs so freaking clumpy. Most of the mascaras I buy have a lip on the inside to get rid of excess product off the wand but this one doesn‚Äôt so all the product sticks.

I recieved this complimentary from influenster. I absolutely love this brand and was ecstatic to receive this to try! I love how volumizing this mascara is and how smooth it applies to to your lash. The mascara itself takes abit to dry but the end result is worth the wait. The one thing I did notice is that the mascara does not appear to be waterproof. I overall like this mascara but wish it was waterproof!,18 Mar 2020,Anastasia volumizing mascara,christeeniee,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"I received this mascara to review. This is a complex mascara. It is thick, heavy, and tricky to apply without making a mess. It also takes a while to dry, so you have to remember not to blink too hard while it‚Äôs drying. The instructions say to scrape the excess off the wand before application. This does help a lot, but the product is still messy.  It is also hard to remove, and I‚Äôve only used two coats. I can‚Äôt imagine trying to remove three coats. With that said, if you‚Äôre willing to put in the extra work and time, the mascara is beautiful on the lashes. It does thicken and lengthen as it promises to do.  I would not repurchase because the product smears under my eyes. That is a complete deal breaker for me.",17 Mar 2020,Complicated Mascara,MamaHubb,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"I personally do not care for this mascara in comparison to others that I‚Äôve used. It goes on very thick, even with just one application. I prefer a more natural looking lash.

Loved trying this mascara. First impression wasn't great because I got it all over my eyelid and made a mess. I probably just had too much on the brush. I applied three coats to get the look I liked.

"I lovedddd this product. Im not going to lie that I was a little skeptical at first since I have been using the same benefit mascara for about a year now. Once I gave this one a shot though, I don‚Äôt think I could ever go back. It does a great job of adding body to my lashes and allows for buildable length. The hourglass brush helped reduce clumping and allow for more precision. The only negative was that I feel like it might be a little heavy on my lashes, causing them to lose their curl but nothing too drastic. Definitely my new favorite!",17 Mar 2020,My New Favorite!,Aud11,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"The tube is heavy. Looks pretty. Gives really good length, lift and fullness volume to lashes. Use two coats max. 
Anymore will clump. I‚Äôm not a fan of BTS. Anastasia lash brag gives me so much lengthening. BTS does not.  My lashes have a fairly good curl. Generally don‚Äôt curl my lashes. But have been trying a lash curler lately. When I first apply this mascara it‚Äôs a wow....long and thick lashes. Unfortunately, after just a few hours my lashes completely lose its curl and lift. So this mascara does not hold a curl to my lashes. I‚Äôve never had a mascara do this. That‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt care for it.

Definitely worth the $25. The packaging of the product was fun, I really love rose gold. While it did feel like I had mascara on my lashes, the formula didn‚Äôt make my lashes feel weighed down. The formula is very buildable, I applied it twice to each eye for better results. I wore the product for 8 hours twice so far and it held up very well and did not run.

However, when applying it, I noticed that it immediately started getting clumpy. I was able to fix it with some finessing, but it was not the most user friendly process. Even so, will say that it did volumize my lashes well. I prefer for my mascaras to volumize and lengthen. This one had the volume but didn‚Äôt do much for my length.

I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster to review. I'm a huge ABH fan but I never stray from my usual mascara so I dont think I would've bought it on my own.

I was not expecting to be impressed by this mascara. I‚Äôm not sure why that was my first thought but it was. I tried it out and was honestly blown away. It lengthened my lashes so much and was so light weight. It is definitely a mascara that I will buy again!,15 Mar 2020,,dangitsalison,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"This mascara is SO NICE. Omg just the weight of the packaging feels so luxurious. I love the shape of the wand, and I feel like it makes my lashes look so long with just one swipe!!

"I liked my results on day one, but the subsequent days, the mascara came out very thick and clumpy - kind of like the gasket that keeps the excess off of the brush was broken.

I absolutely love this mascara! I never heard about it until receiving it in the mail and now it‚Äôs my biggest rave between my friends and I.

"I received this product complimentary in an Influenster VoxBox. My favorite make up product ever is mascara I cannot go a day without it and I was very excited when I got the email for this box! I opened it up straight away and used it the day I got it and ever since! It makes my lashes look fuller and longer even though I do have long lashes, I feel that they don‚Äôt look very full they look thinned out and this mascara really helps that and looks absolutely stunning. After seeing pictures from other people I do think that this product works with a bunch of different types of lashes whether they be very thin or very curly it is absolutely stunning on everyone and helps your lashes look fuller & darker. PLUS it‚Äôs not chunky one bit! The wand is not a typical wand that I like to use I like to use the wands with very thin very short stubby bristles as it really gets every lash without looking chunky but the way that this wand shaped doesn‚Äôt make application harder or chunky which I like very much.",15 Mar 2020,I love this mascara!,allikay29,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I've been wearing this every day since I received it complimentary for testing from Influenster. I'm really enjoying it. I don't get racoon eyes at the end of the night, its not hard to wash off. I have naturally long but thin lashes and this does give them a nice voluminous boost. It is a bit chunky at times, but I don't think that's the end of the world for mascara. It doesn't flake off so I just brush them out and carry on. I'm impressed.",15 Mar 2020,Impressed,dreamerb,Anastasia,Mascara,No

I‚Äôve been using Too Faced Better than Sex mascara for a couple years now and was excited to try this mascara because of the similar hourglass shaped want and see how it compared. I could tell after just one use that this mascara makes my lashes look fuller and longer. Combination of formula and brush DOES NOT CLUMP MY LASHES!

Found my new favorite mascara and will recommend to everyone!,14 Mar 2020,Something to brag about,PinkPrincess88,Anastasia,Mascara,No
You guys...the formula is perfect. It lifts the lashes so beautifully and your lashes actually hold the volume! Unlike most brands my eyelashes typically go flat after a few minutes (without lashes) but not with this. It doesn‚Äôt weight down your lashes and it doesn‚Äôt get dried out and flaky.

"I received this mascara free from Influenster. Right off the bat, I have to say the packaging is heavy and luxurious but with a big downfall... when you remove the wand, too much product is left in the back part of the wand. If you try to wipe it off it‚Äôs a hot mess . As to how the mascara performs... it‚Äôs awesome. Because the wand stays with a lot of product you get a very voluminous look fast, but you have to be careful because you can get a big clump of mascara formula on the lashes. Would I buy it with my own money? No, simply because of the packaging which is a big problem for me. If they fixed that the mascara would be nearly perfect!",14 Mar 2020,,camib,Anastasia,Mascara,No

"i LOVE the packaging. it‚Äôs cute, the packaging is heavy so it feels expensive, and i love the colors. when i first opened it, i thought the want shape/bristles looked cheap, but i figured i‚Äôd give it a shot. i fully curled my eyelashes and applied the first coat (without any other makeup on so i could fully see what this was about) and was ultimately disappointed. the formula is clumpy, the brush makes it hard to target certain lashes (which is one of my top necessities) and the wand basically un-curled my lashes while applying. the formula felt like a cheeeap drug store brand in an expensive bottle. disappointed and won‚Äôt reach for this again.",13 Mar 2020,,livreh,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"Bomb bomb bomb , has an hour glass type wand which is great at really bringing out the lashes .

I don‚Äôt normally go for a mascara that is waterproof because I hate the way it makes my eyelashes feel and it normally flakes on me throughout the day but this one did exactly what it is supposed to do. It separated the lashes, it provided volume and lift, and it didn‚Äôt flake at all. Now, my lashes are already really long naturally, so I hate big clunky brushes and I was nervous about this one because it has a rather large spooly. If you like those then fantastic. If you don‚Äôt I would still give this a try. I think this spooly ended up being somewhere in the middle of very very large and normal size. I handled it well and didn‚Äôt end up getting it all over my eyelid and that was a nice surprise for me. Altogether I think I found my new favorite mascara.... even if it is more expensive than my normal go to. 
I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",11 Mar 2020,AMAZING. Don‚Äôt hesitate.,haeyoc,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"The best mascara! I have loved the better than sex mascara for years. I have since began to love the L‚ÄôOr√©al lash paradise as well, but this one takes the cake! Not clumpy, doesn‚Äôt smear, only volumizes and lengthens.",11 Mar 2020,,kimberrsss,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"Okay so I literally just got this in the mail from Influenster. opened it up, and put it on one eye to compare to the other with my normal go to. Wow. One swipe and my lashes look amazing. Not one layer, one SWIPE. Actually black, not charcoal grey like a lot of ‚Äúblack‚Äù mascaras. I didn‚Äôt expect anything different from this brand, but wow. Really.",11 Mar 2020,,waverdawn,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I love this mascara! I would say it‚Äôs on par with my other favorite, Better Than Sex from from Too Faced. Not clumpy at all or heavy. Since it‚Äôs the same price as the Too Faced I‚Äôd definitely consider buying this in the future. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",11 Mar 2020,,Kathryn12345678,Anastasia,Mascara,No

Received this today in my Influenster box and I love it!! It made my lashes flare out and gave them so much volume. The brush is one of my favorite type of mascara brushes so it was a bonus,11 Mar 2020,,sebnemqurbani,Anastasia,Mascara,No
This product is amazing! Very easy to use and you don‚Äôt need to use a lot to get long thick lashes. I haven‚Äôt had any problem with flaking either.,11 Mar 2020,great mascara!,hornfeck,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I love this mascara! I was super excited to try it and it did not disappoint!! It volumized my lashes so well as well as lengthening them, I only needed one coast whereas other mascaras requires a few coats, the color is a really deep black and looks amazing!! Very impressed!",11 Mar 2020,Great product!,Alessandrao,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"I loved this mascara. The wand was a great size: big enough to give your lashes great volume and length, but not too big that it gets on your skin. My eye color is brown, and I had the black colored mascara and it was a great match. I also the packaging of the mascara, it is so pretty! I received this mascara for free in my influenster box. I highly recommend and would buy this product again!",11 Mar 2020,Great Product!,mwol54321,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"The mascara went on well and had good definition, but every time I pulled the wand out, a ton of actual mascara came out too. Like, huge glops of it. When I tried to put the wand back in, it pushed even more mascara out of the tube, so upon first use, easily 1/3 of the mascara had oozed out of the tube and I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to pull the wand out without scooping out a ton of product or put it back in without pushing out more product. It made the second application very clumpy bc of the chunks on the wand. Almost like the tube was over full and the wand was forcing it out. I received this mascara for free as part of a program to review products, but even so it would be very irritating to waste so much mascara - especially for how expensive this is.",11 Mar 2020,"Good, but...",emilyeae95,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"NEW FAVE! Love how black this mascara is and is super volumizing. My lashes are naturally fairly long and curled, but this takes it to the next level. Very easy to apply, and would recommend to anyone wanting to be a little extra with their mascara choice. (Drugstore does just fine, but this one just *hits different*)",10 Mar 2020,10/10 Would Recommend,aimee95,Anastasia,Mascara,No
"This product is great. I didn‚Äôt see the mascara flake through the day and it was easy to apply. I didn‚Äôt have to do a couple coats before I saw the volume I wanted but other than that it‚Äôs perfect. The pigmentation is good, it‚Äôs very black and coats my lashes great. I highly recommend.",10 Mar 2020,It‚Äôs amazing!,CeleseSalas,Anastasia,Mascara,No
When I received this mascara I though it was going to just be another one that gave you spider lashes and clumped after a bit of wear. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. The volume isnt extreme but it really defines and lifts the lashes. This may become my new day to day mascara!,10 Mar 2020,natural looking volume,sibiliosayswhat,Anastasia,Mascara,No
