Not a right product if you have oily skin,Daria06,03 Feb 2025,"This mascara gave me panda eyes, also it dries out quickly and the applicator doesn‚Äôt lengthen the lashes",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best mascara ever,Sophoe1010,31 Jan 2025,"I have used this mascara for almost 5 years now and I will not go back to other products. This is a high quality mascara and applies lightly, limiting any clumping. The brush shape prevents clumping as well. The one con is the price.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Lengthening but not volumizing,sockmonkey14,29 Jan 2025,"Great mascara for a light, wispy look. I wasn‚Äôt impressed with the volume, though. The brush has areas with no bristles to supposedly get more product for volume, but I found the product just dried in those areas of the brush. I might try the new exagger-eyes mascara from CT.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,hanna1211,26 Jan 2025,"This mascara doesn‚Äôt provide length or volume. It clumps lashes together, dries out, and the brush is uncomfortable.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Clumpy and Smudge,carebear626,21 Jan 2025,It‚Äôs so clumpy and even on the rare occasion it looks okay it smudges off in like 5 min,Tilbury,Mascara,No
I don‚Äôt understand all of the glowing reviews,mvandendooren,18 Jan 2025,"I have tried probably half of all of the mascaras that Sephora carries, so I was excited to try this one after reading all of the glowing reviews. I have to say that for my lashes, it‚Äôs a disappointment. First of all, the formula is quite dry, and because of this, it results in a feathery, thin but soft-looking lash. Maybe that‚Äôs what some are  going for, because it looks a bit more natural? The brush doesn‚Äôt do a great job of extending and defining the lashes, which might be fine for those who have lashes that are always perfectly aligned. Mine need a strong brush that can manipulate them to make a nice ‚Äúfan‚Äù. It literally took about 7-8 minutes of coat after coat after coat to make my eyelashes look good. Aaand, I had to come back again after finishing the rest of my makeup to get them back ‚Äúup‚Äù. This while also navigating the fact that the brush is kind of flat-ish, in that it only has bristles on two ends which requires a certain mastery. I can see that ultimately the results are decent, which is why I gave it three stars, but why would I spend 8 minutes doing mascara, when it takes only 1-2 minutes using old standbys like Roller Lash and Bad Gal? I‚Äôll stick to my Benefit mascaras.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Long lash vibes,,11 Jan 2025,Goes on really smooth and lifts my lashes instantly!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Will buy every time I run out.,Josieekk,09 Jan 2025,"This mascara is really amazing! A lot of other brands have mini mascara and their smaller and more expensive, surprisingly this one isnt to bad for 15 dollars. Doesn‚Äôt smudge, more length then volume.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
worth the price!,,4 Jan 2025,i got this a week ago and have been loving it so much! this mascara gives volume and length without any clumps! this is by far my favorite mascara and i use it daily,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,jamisynlyden,2 Jan 2025,"super clumpy and thick, i tried to take some of the product off the wand and it was still very clumpy. it makes my eyelashes fall within about 10 minutes of wearing, and will rub off on to my lower eye. i do not recommend.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
nope,BrendaLisa,29 Dec 2024,I was so disappointed. It literally felt like it was dry and expired.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Mitsyy,24 Dec 2024,"i love the brush, it lets me be precise with the way i like to apply my mascara. the downside is that it will be smudged under my eyes by the end of the day, though this can be somewhat managed with a good setting spray.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
One of the worst mascaras on the market,maddieeshea,23 Dec 2024,"I like to consider myself a mascara expert as I have tried many on the market, and this is definitely one of if not the worst I have ever tried. It is incredibly dry, and absolutely not volumnizing whatsoever. If you wanted this to have any volume, you would have to apply 100 coats.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Mirvina,22 Dec 2024,"I used to love this product but not anymore. The last time I got it from sephora, didn‚Äôt last a week cause it was super dry like there was no product inside. Maybe it was used I don‚Äôt know but it was loss of money. I will never buy it again. I guess was empty",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Snowy11,13 Dec 2024,I am not the biggest fan of this it‚Äôs just not for me.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great Staple,hollaabackk,6 Dec 2024,"The sample of this impressed me so much I bought a full size ASAP. Love the brush and it‚Äôs a good formula (it‚Äôs a formula that ones it‚Äôs been used a few times it gets better, drier)",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Crumbly and short lasting,ARobb123,27 Nov 2024,I can‚Äôt even use this it just crumbles and leaves black specks everywhere. Really poor quality and doesn‚Äôt stay on.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Really Disappointed,nocw,24 Nov 2024,"I confess that I chose this mascara because it was the only one that didn't have the word ""EXTREME"" in its name, lol (well, also because CT is generally a good brand, and I have liked some of their other products). Unfortunately, this mascara was messy to apply and clumpy. It was hard to remove the inevitable smudges from my eyelids. It managaed to come off pretty easily from my lashes, however, because it regularly left me with dark circles under my eyes after only a few hours. The color is nice, and I only got a travel size- those are the best two things about this purchase. :(",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Fabulous mascara,GENXBUTEEJUNKEY,24 Nov 2024,"I love this mascara. It lifts the lashes and coats them evenly. No flaking, smudging, or wearing off during the day. I keep trying other brands, but always go back to this one.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Holy Grail,laurencollin,20 Nov 2024,"This is my ride or die. It makes my eyelashes Gorg, I constantly get questions if I‚Äôm wearing falsies. Absolutely the best.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Beautiful,sarsurraa,17 Nov 2024,This mascara is gorgeous. I have light green heterochromia eye color with a yellow hue/ring. It make my eye color stand out! I have already bought this twice. My husband wont let me wear black mascara anymore,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Beautiful Colour. Bad wand,Jackie19952,13 Nov 2024,"Amazing colour! If you are a redhead this is the perfect colour for you! It looks so natural but still gives length! However, the wand is so weird. It made my lashes very clumpy and got the mascara on my skin.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
I love this product it‚Äôs sooooooo good,jhanalh,9 Nov 2024,It‚Äôs easy to apply and open makes my lashes look so much better than they look naturally,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Don‚Äôt waste your money on this,ViktoriiaKroo,4 Nov 2024,I bought this mascara because I thought it has beautiful color but  I‚Äôm disappointed. The color is not the same when you apply it and I have long eyelashes but with that mascara it looks like I don‚Äôt have any and after couple hours you will have dark circles under your eyes. Definitely not recommend it. Don‚Äôt waste your money couplechours,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,WanderingLeah,2 Nov 2024,I super loved this mascara. But I ended up having a reaction to it two months after getting it. It made my eyes super itchy and puffy. Beautiful color and definitely did give my lashes volume. Super sad when I couldn‚Äôt use it again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
My new go to,FutureMrsGuezmi,30 Oct 2024,"Received a sample size of this. Put one coat on. I don‚Äôt know where those eyelashes came from, but this will be my new go to mascara! Obsessed!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
not for me,zoeyrae05,25 Oct 2024,"really doesn‚Äôt do anything to my lashes. Looks like i barely put any on, i used it for my bottom lashes instead of the top because it just doesn‚Äôt work. way too overpriced",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,leialexisa,22 Oct 2024,"I wish I could say better things about this mascara. I‚Äôm giving it one star because it made my lashes longer but smudged so bad. I love almost all of Charlotte Tilbury‚Äôs products but, this was a miss for me. Wouldn‚Äôt buy it again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Why all the hate?,SeekerSadie,19 Oct 2024,"Why are people hating on this mascara so much? This was the first charlotte tilbury product I‚Äôve tried and all I can say, is that I am shocked with the results. After curling my lashes, I apply 2-3 layers. At the end of the day, none of the mascara comes off and it hold my lashes up. I get so many compliments a day, and I will 100% repurchase.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

!BEST EVER!  ü•∞,TWski,18 Oct 2024,"After decades of clumpy mascara, I have found the first that doesn‚Äôt clump. BEST MASCARA EVER!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
The best natural looking mascara for my lashes!,bellaksh,15 Oct 2024,"I got the mini size to try it out and it‚Äôs been phenomenal! I have very sparse but long lashes so I was looking for a natural-looking mascara that gives some volume and this was THE ONE. It looks so natural on my lashes but also gives me just the smallest bit of volume! Here‚Äôs how I use it: I go in with the bristled side first and do a coat or two, then I use the flat side and push it up into my lashes. Then I comb it out once more with the bristled side. So good, 10/10 recommend!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not Great,godfl,14 Oct 2024,Great applicator but product is awful.  Product clumped when putting it on and flaked constantly until it was taken off.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudges so easily!,katiecoops,14 Oct 2024,The only item I‚Äôve ever returned to Sephora! Was shocked - I had dark circles and smudging under my eyes after 3 hours of wear. Also not volumizing at all. You just don‚Äôt get enough ‚Äútraction‚Äù with the wand.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Overpriced,makeups2000,14 Oct 2024,For the price point I wish I could give 0 stars! Go to a cvs and buy any other one and I‚Äôm sure it will do better!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Trash,rhondajackie,10 Oct 2024,"Raccoon eyes after an hour. Nope!
Too expensive to be this bad.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Too expensive for what it is,Mikaylajadeh,6 Oct 2024,"I love CT and I used this mascara for YEARS because it does look pretty and is very lengthening if you can finagle it. However, EVERY tube of this I've bought has been as dry as the Sahara. It's so dry that it is difficult to use and get an even coat on my eyelashes, even brand new. For 30 dollars I just don't think it's worth the money. There are better, cheaper mascaras out there.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,dfaltis,5 Oct 2024,This mascara is very clumpy and smudges easily.  The applicator applies the product in clumps on your lashes and there have been a few times that it was so bad that I needed to wash off my eye makeup and start over.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Mascara that gives you lash looks Ôøº,SNValdez,4 Oct 2024,"This mascara is my go to it, elongates my lashes thickens them. A lot of people think I have fall slashes but it‚Äôs the mascara really volumes the lashes and makes them long and beautiful Ôøº",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Looks good at first,sillynilly111,19 Sep 2024,"It looks good when applied at first, but then during the day it doesn't hold a curl at all. My curled lashes immediately fall straight. The package says it's ""humidity proof"" but unfortunately that is not the case.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Cute but smudges,melody0,6 Sep 2024,"I know what you‚Äôre thinking Charlotte Tilbury is new and trending. And have some amazing products on the market.  I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre thinking the mascara will be the same. And yes the mascara application looks stunning, however after wearing it for half a day. It smudges really bad.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Sad experience,darkhanna,4 Sep 2024,"This is the worst mascara I ever had, it looks fine in the beginning but then no matter hot or cold weather it ends up smeared around and below the eye area, which looks like I cried... Def not what I want from mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
MUST HAVEE,Paolaaagal,31 Aug 2024,"I received a sample for my birthday and I‚Äôm in loveeee
 I mean it",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,NikiN792,29 Aug 2024,"Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt impressed! A lot of product comes off the brush and I find myself wiping a lot of it off. I hate when you have to do that. It‚Äôs either too much or too little. It does give volume but overall I didn‚Äôt care for it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dagger-eyed mascara,Bigheaddental,26 Aug 2024,"So I‚Äôm seeing how my lashes look using the Exagger-eyes volume mascara and I have mixed feelings. The end result does look very good, however the product I think is kinda messy. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs too thick or if the brush is wrong for the formulas consistency. After brushing it through my lashes with a different brush I was able to get the look I wanted. Try it for yourself see what you think.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing,,26 Aug 2024,This Exagger-eyes volume mascara is beyond amazing! It makes me eyes feel so much volume and gives me that extra boost I need. My lashes look longer and feel fuller. The brush is great and gives it that extra curl.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,AnnaR10,25 Aug 2024,Mascara dried out too quickly after only one use. It also not good at lengthening and volumizing.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
BESTTT,angelolivia,24 Aug 2024,LOVE LOVE LOVEEEE. The wand pushes lashes up and the mascara formula is long lasting but not impossible to remove.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Not terrible, not the best",VivianLm,14 Aug 2024,"I have used high end and drugstore mascaras and this one just falls right in the middle. It does give me length and volume, but drugstore doesn‚Äôt better for me. For reference, I have straight Asian lashes. The first pic is pillow talk and the second pic is with my L‚ÄôOr√©al mascara",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,avert112,14 Aug 2024,This is my favorite mascara! It has an amazing wand that has absolutely no clumps and it make my lashes look so long and natural!!! It is also very cheap and super affordable!,Tilbury,Mascara,No

THE BESt,kkwl5,11 Aug 2024,I loved this mascara it came with a ton of product more than a lot of high end mascaras and made my lashes super voluminous.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
A New Fav!!,ShelbyAshlynn,10 Aug 2024,Really enjoy this mascara! Layers well and adds amazing length without being overly clumpy. My only complaint is it smudges on my combination skin close to the end of the day. Still would recommend!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Perfect for redheads,hvc322,7 Aug 2024,"It‚Äôs really hard to find a good mascara that is also a pretty brown color. This one was my fave, and now it‚Äôs not available anymore??? Sephora please bring this back!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
PLEASE CHOOSE ANY OTHER MASCARA,emilyjenks123,5 Aug 2024,"This might be the most awful mascara I‚Äôve ever used. I had to wipe the under of my eyes a minimum of eight times throughout the workday to prevent myself from looking like a raccoon. Could not be more disappointed. Please, CHOOSE ANY OTHER MASCARA",Tilbury,Mascara,No
BEST MASCARA I‚ÄôVE EVER USED!!,KaylerBeattie,5 Aug 2024,"I love how this mascara curls, lengthens and separates my lashes and doesn‚Äôt flake. It‚Äôs literally perfect lashes in one coat.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
No clump dream,teej11,31 Jul 2024,I actually love this mascara. I am a fan of minis in all mascaras Becuase I feel like I can control the brush better. But if you like your lashes to look natural but enhanced this is it. It doesn‚Äôt make my lashes clumpy at all. The brush is so nice and keeps all my lashes seperste while adding just an extrasomething. I don‚Äôt like real thick mascara. This is also didn‚Äôt smudge on me as my day went on like a lot of mascaras do that aren‚Äôt water proof,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,carlyyyym,31 Jul 2024,I honestly expected this to be better than it was. I was really excited but I thought the formula was too dry for my liking. It also doesn‚Äôt hold curl at all and flakes. Save your money and go to a different mascara.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
cute,xostxoelxola,31 Jul 2024,Love this product but after a little while it smudged under my lower lashes,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love love love,r2d2gurl,30 Jul 2024,"Love it.  Totally made my eyelash standout and no clumps 

Totally recommend it",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointed,KatherineeeH,11 Jul 2024,After using this product only once I am extremely disappointed. The product came dried out and unusable. I don't know if this was just an accident for it to dry out or if this is happening to everyone who has bought it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudging nightmare,OmiRose,8 Jul 2024,"This mascara was not made for long eyelashes. It smudges and it is not humidity proof or sweat proof.   I tried the mascara with and without setting spray and both smudged. 

The people giving this mascara a high rating seem to have micro or almost non existent eyelashes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,SaltedPotato,8 Jul 2024,"My favourite mascara was out of stock, so I tried this. The first wear I was fairly disappointed, it applied great and made my lashes look great... however, 1 hour after wear, I had raccoon eyes. I'm only doing office work, and I don't wear any other eye product. 
Just to make use of it, I can apply a thin coat to my top lashes, and it holds a little better. It's still not great, but I may as well use it up. I'm not a fan of returning products.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Mayah17,6 Jul 2024,BRING BACK BERRY BROWN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
WORST,Beautelley,2 Jul 2024,This product dried in a few days and the brush is not at all worth anything. I've bout a mascara on amazon that was 10 stars better than this one. the only downfall to that one is that it was liquidity and I had to take caution when applying. Sales reps in Sephora really just selling products...,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dried out in a matter of days,Pharmproaz,1 Jul 2024,I have used this product for a few weeks.  It was great for th first ew applications but now it is totally dried out.  I tried adding a little bit of hyluronic acid serum and I got a few more days then it was all dried out again.  I through it out and went back to my old mascara.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Brown berry color is gone?!,alleejce,30 Jun 2024,Stopping selling the brown berry color was the worst mistake. It‚Äôs truly the best. Severely disappointed. Esp since it isn‚Äôt discontinued- you can buy it from ULTA and the CT website.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Never going to buy anything else,brittaneygirl,26 Jun 2024,Im absolutely flabbergasted on the quality I‚Äôve tried endless amounts of mascaras from Sephora but this so far is my #1. I bought this to use at my wedding because I absolutely love a brown mascara I believe it just looks so delicate. Now it is a must daily use in my makeup regimen. The bristles separate your lashes so well and the formula is not clumpy . Can be layered  the only downside that is also a  plus is that the brush is very long so that sometimes it can hit the inner corner of your eye but also it is a flatter type brush so it is less common and easy to get into smaller areas like lower lash line and inner eye lashes,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,1i11iana,25 Jun 2024,"it's is a no!
I tried this, and it is so crusty and clumps easily. this leaves crumbs under my eyes too. I've seen alot of people say that they love it but I don't.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Don‚Äôt waste your money,Paisla,18 Jun 2024,This product sucked. The spoolie is the worst thing I have ever used. The packaging is cute and all but not worth it. It says volumizing and lengthening but it doesn‚Äôt do any of that. Will be returning.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,avert112,18 Jun 2024,I love this mascara so much! It has such an amazing applicator and has such a nice formula! It is so nice because it is not clumpy at all and makes my lashes look so long! ÔøºÔøº,Tilbury,Mascara,No

I‚Äôd say but it!,Megan2373,13 Jun 2024,"Ms. Charlotte Tilbury stop being the best!!! It‚Äôs unfair to everyone else! Love the brand and this product, but not my favorite from them.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Nope üëé,2puppies,4 Jun 2024,I bought this for the colour. I was hoping the wand and product would live up to the hype.  Nope üëé it  doesn't lengthen or volumize- It did the opposite. And I had an allergic reaction!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Wasn't a fan,kmbx96,4 Jun 2024,"After countless reviews on Sephora's website and TikTok, I was excited to try this product. Sadly, I was disappointed. The application is a two-step process: paint mascara on, then brush out the lashes, and I really did not care for this. I don't feel any mascara should be this elaborate, let alone one that costs $30. I understand the thought behind it, but ultimately, this process makes application difficult and lengthy. The product smudges throughout the day--this may or may not be due to how I apply it, though. My conclusion is that you're basically paying for the name of the brand, rather than a good product.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love it,beautyaddict81,2 Jun 2024,"I had gotten a free sample of this mascara and made my lashes look in sane so long , I only subtracted 1 star because they fell half way through the shift , but it‚Äôs amazing stuff and will buy the full size , no smudges ! Perfect",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Just okay,StarZo,30 May 2024,It's okay. It gives length. It's good after the first 4 uses. After that the mascara just starts coming out weird if that make any sense.  I wouldn't buy this again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not impressed,fresca,30 May 2024,I thought I would have been more impressed with CT mascara‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Raccoon eyes and lashes started to fall out,mavieenrouge,30 May 2024,"Absolutely loved this mascara the first time I tried it. Applied beautifully and made my lashes long and defined without being clumpy and thick. Unfortunately it smudges all over my under eye area shortly after applying. Powder, setting spray, different concealer - nothing helps. Mascara got more and more clumpy and harder to apply with every use. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, it also caused some of my eye lashes to fall out. It took a while to fully fill back in once I switched to a different mascara, but I immediately stopped loosing lashes when I switched. So there‚Äôs that.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Would never purchase this again,Carla179,29 May 2024,Honestly very disappointed in the mascara especially considering the price point. The mascara transfers through out the day and overall doesn‚Äôt give my lashes the wow effect. Do not recommend.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
A must have in my routine‚ú®,JombaJuice,28 May 2024,"Wanted to switch some things up in my routine, mascara being one of them. The best one i‚Äôve ever tried which is not clumpy.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not a fan,SuzanneR13,27 May 2024,"Always seem to be on the hunt for a great mascara. This one still isn't it. Brush is awkward to use, very clumpy application and guaranteed racoon eyes. Can't say I noticed any more length or volume than L'Or√©al mascara (that isn't so clumpy and about 20 bucks less).",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Wish I didn‚Äôt buy,maskedelmo,26 May 2024,"I love all her other products but this needs work. It said it lifts and lengthens but once I got home from buying this, i was disappointed to see that it wasn‚Äôt lifting my lashes once so ever it made my eyelashes feel wet and overtime causes lining under your eyes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Annika86,19 May 2024,Nice colour for green eyes. Great volumizing mascara. The main problem is it runs easily and smudges.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
MUST HAVE BUY ITTTT,Kenzislays,12 May 2024,I loved this bc it‚Äôs SUCH a CLEAN GURL mascara because it look sooooooo natural it like basically put false lashes on but natural WHATTTTT GO.BUY.IT.!!!!!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Soft and natural look,sixeyes,10 May 2024,This might be one of the best mascara formulas I‚Äôve tried and the applicator complements it perfectly. The end result is a length and thickness to my lashes that isn‚Äôt overly clumpy or crunchy.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Raccoon eyes!,Tigermom96,9 May 2024,This mascara does not last and gives me horrible raccoon eyes. It‚Äôs think amd clumpy. Hate I wasted $29 on this horrible mascara.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
New Favourite,EmilyOntario,9 May 2024,"I‚Äôve been true to my drugstore mascara since Y2K but received a trial size of this mascara. It would take A LOT to get me to switch (and pay 4x the price!). Well, it gave me A LOT of beautiful, full lashes. . #converted",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Ideal brown mascara,AnnieMcCubbin,4 May 2024,"After tirelessly searching for the perfect brown mascara, I stumbled upon Charlotte Tilbury's Pillow Talk mascara in the shade berry brown, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The quest for a true brown mascara seemed never-ending, with previous purchases yielding disappointingly black lashes that barely differentiated from standard black mascaras. However, this gem truly delivers on its promise ‚Äì it's genuinely brown on my lashes, a rare find indeed!

Finally, I can confidently say I've found the ideal brown mascara. But, as fate would have it, there's always a catch. In this case, it's the tendency for the mascara to collect excess product, leading to pesky clumps if not carefully managed before application. It's a minor setback, but one worth noting.

Overall, Charlotte Tilbury's Pillow Talk mascara in berry brown is a winner for those in pursuit of the elusive true brown mascara. Despite its tendency to clump, its rich brown hue makes it worth the extra effort. Check out the accompanying image to see the results for yourself!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Nope,anicm,1 May 2024,You can find cheaper drug store alternatives that do way more than this. Skip it,Tilbury,Mascara,No

The brush is great.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Glides on lovely need waterproof version in brown,cleannatural,28 Apr 2024,"When shopping at Sephora, this sample was popped into my bag.  Love how it applies ( not clumpy or excessive) and the brown color looks more natural.  Brush worked great to separate lashes.

,aaliyahlyn,12 Apr 2024,After using this mascara for a month or so I have some pros and cons. The mascara does an excellent job separating your lashes and covers them very good. The mascara isn‚Äôt dry at all and lifts my lashes. The only con is that it bleeds,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointed,,9 Apr 2024,It applied nicely at first but within a couple hours it crumbles and flakes off onto your lid and under you eyes. I expected better from Charlotte Tilbury it‚Äôs disappointing. I‚Äôm glad I only bought the mini,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Unique color but bad formula,bmakeup426,6 Apr 2024,"This color is beautiful and super unique. I love it with my green eyes. However, this mascara did not hold my lashes and they fell almost immediately after application. After a day of wearing, I would usually be left with a good amount under my eyes. I also had to throw my tube away because it dried up so quickly, both on the brush and in the tube itself. I want to repurchase because of the color, but haven't because I know I will be unhappy with the formula.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Wish I loved,ShaanShann,30 Mar 2024,wanted to love this. the color is fantastic but the brush and the formula are the problem. the formula doesn't last and the brush barely adds fanning and volume. unfortunately returning.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great for this redhead!,natkat19,20 Mar 2024,Dream pop is perfect for redheads! It doesn‚Äôt look like a crazy color when you put it on. It looks great because it‚Äôs less harsh of a color than black against my fair complexion. Will def be repurchasing!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Started off good but went downhill fast,Regmeralda,19 Mar 2024,"I was really happy with this product, until the end of the day when I looked in the mirror and had tons of mascara under both eyes. Goes on nice and the brush is great but the product doesn‚Äôt stay put.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

The Worst!,vanlib,13 Mar 2024,"This mascara was so disappointing! It has a useless brush, does nothing for your lashes and within a couple of hours you have dark smears under your eyes. Total waste of money.  Will be returning",Tilbury,Mascara,No
LOVE,josphammy,11 Mar 2024,LOVE THIS MASCARA i wanted my eyelashes to stay curled all day and it definitely did just that the brush is kinda weird i never saw a brush like it and if i poke my eye it hurts alot cause the brissles are very dense. the reasoning for the missing star is the price. definitely a little overpriced but i understand its ct,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Beautiful Color Tricky Brush,BridgetRB,10 Mar 2024,"I really wanted to be able to give four stars but the brush is just so tricky to use, for me. The color is amazing though and it didn't transfer into my eyelids like most mascaras do",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Perfect for a softer look,WinnieLeigh,10 Mar 2024,Honestly I was a little nervous with how purple/maroon it looked on the brush but love the effect. Some days I want a softer look and this does the trick.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not good,feraragon,9 Mar 2024,"Charlotte tilbury products are always a hit, I had high expectations of this mascara. It is a mess, I‚Äôd doesn‚Äôt seem like you are wearing anything, so I thought ok this will be for my more natural looks, but then it smudges all over my eyelid in no time. Not worth it. Thank god I bough the mini size.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Good, but a little pricy",Bryynnn,7 Mar 2024,"This is honestly the perfect color for my lashes, but there are really amazing drugstore options that work almost as good, as this, and are half the price. However, if you have the money, I really like this color on me and I think it's a good option for mascara, just a little pricy.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
The BEST Mascara EVER,TammyRPG,7 Mar 2024,"This is hands down the best mascara I‚Äôve ever used. Not clumpy at all, and I swear it‚Äôs like having false eyelashes after applying.

One of the best mascaras I've ever used!,BbfluxBARBIE,3 Mar 2024,"I typically use tubing mascaras as I love how long they last and how they tend not to flake (I use Blinc).   That being said, this is the absolute best non-tubing mascara I've ever used.   The wand is fantastic with a flat center between two combs so you can thicken the mascara then slightly turn the wand so the comb end, which evenly spreads the formula through your lashes.   The result is beautiful!   I've had this tube over a month now and NO CLUMPS.   Not sure what other people are doing or if they just don't know how to use the wand properly but I have had ZERO issues.  In fact, I'm definitely buying this on repeat from now on.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Hit or Miss,angelbabyxox33,2 Mar 2024,"Coming from someone with pretty long lashes, I was pretty disappointed when I put this on. the first time I wore the mascara, it looked amazing without a single clump, but the 2nd wear it didn't do much at all. It kind of just clumped and I believe that there are much better mascaras at the drug store for cheaper, but everyones eyelashes are different.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,BrieVDP,26 Feb 2024,"I get complimented on this mascara (berry brown color) constantly! It‚Äôs subtle but impactful. My only complaint is the wand. The wand n sucks. I wish it had the wand of the Ilia limitless mascara. It takes several brushes to apply,  so it adds time to my",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Sadly disappointed,Spaghettina,24 Feb 2024,"I have been wanting to try this for a while, sadly it really didn‚Äôt work for me. The color looks just weird, kind of red but not flattering. Will go back to Too Faced brown mascara, still my fav.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Nope,sarahtuch,23 Feb 2024,It was cute once. Just once. Then it flaked and clumped my eyelashes and it feels like there‚Äôs no product in there? Doesn‚Äôt hold a curl or add volume at all so no idea what that claim is.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

My favourite,apoloziuk,16 Feb 2024,My favourite mascara right now. Amazing colour for green eyes and I like how it makes my eyelashes longer. I‚Äôve heard some people saying packaging is not closing fully and it‚Äôs drying faster. So I always make sure I close it really good.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not for me,anbelblack,16 Feb 2024,I usually love Charlotte Tilbury but this was not great. It left black smudges under my eyes and on my eyelids. I was constantly having to check a mirror the day I tried this.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
HATE THE WAND.,MorganOx3,13 Feb 2024,"The ""Dream Pop"" color is great and looks great with my red hair. I also really like the formula. However, the wand is awful.

,meganreilly11,12 Feb 2024,"As a mascara lover, I saw this wand and was immediately interested. I couldn‚Äôt have been more disappointed. Drying, does not lengthen, flaky, and transferred easily onto my eyelid. Easily the worst mascara I‚Äôve tried this year.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

pretty bad,ilovecats8,11 Feb 2024,"Wow, this mascara is definitely not worth the hype at all, it made my lashes clumpy and stuck together, the formula was dry as well. Unfortunate cause I wanted to like this mascara, cute packaging tho",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not worth the price,slc188s,10 Feb 2024,"Not easy to apply, didn‚Äôt look like I had mascara on. Very flaky and lots of fall out. I had forgotten I bought it so by the time I tried it I was beyond the return window.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Doesn't dry, leaves smudges",CurlyQCutie,9 Feb 2024,"I give it credit for giving good definition and Volume, but it never dries. Takes forever, and therefore causes smudges under my eyes. I really did love the application  and thought I found my new mascara, until finishing my makeup and seeing that it remained tacky 6 hours later",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Made my lashes 10x longer,lizaruw,8 Feb 2024,This made my lashes SO long I loved the length it gave them without drying them out. One thing i would say is that it goes on very wet so I like to brush my lashes out after I apply but nothing wrong with that. I love this product and would 10/10 recommend!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Pass.,flashb,6 Feb 2024,So underwhelming. Barely does anything even after 10 swipes. Every drugstore mascara I have ever used has been better than this.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Should not be part of your routine,Poshdoll217,4 Feb 2024,"Waste of time buying this . 
I get my lashes done but wanted a mascara in between appointments. Made my eyes super blood shot and itchy. 30 minutes of applying it was already underneath my eyes, look liked I had been out all night. 
Disappointed",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Worst experience ever Ôøº,AmouraSkye1,3 Feb 2024,I really wanted to try this mascara. I ordered it online. It came to the house a couple days later the mascara was dried out in the mascara one got stuck in the tube. I will never order mascara online. Only in the store. Ôøº,Tilbury,Mascara,No

My Go-To,KatieLohan,2 Feb 2024,"I absolutely love this mascara because it makes my lashes look so natural and beautiful. I have never ever been worried about clumps while using this. I use it everyday and when I try something else I just go back to it. Occasionally it gets under my eyes over the day, not recommended as pool ready. Overall great product worth the money.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not worth it.,Gracielynne23,29 Jan 2024,"Love the mascara and the wand, only problem is it sheds like crazy, very disappointing for it being a higher end mascara. I‚Äôve only used covergirl mascara (which I was not a fan of for the same reason) and sky high (which I love for its longevity but I wanted something higher quality) so this was in the middle of those two for me. The formula itself feels light while noticeable making my lashes longer and darker.  Overall three out of five stars for not being an all day mascara,",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Good but not great,NIcoleargenal,25 Jan 2024,"I love the way it goes on and makes my lashes looks. They don‚Äôt clump and it does elongate them, however, the formula runs under the eyes regardless how careful you are applicating.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudges and messy to put on,gotitfrommymama,25 Jan 2024,This is the worst mascara I‚Äôve ever had and I‚Äôve been wearing mascara for over 30 years. I used and then went to my interview when I came home and looked in the mirror I was so embarrassed. It was all over my upper lid and lower lid. I looked like I was crying. I‚Äôve never had a mascara do that.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Will run and burn your eyes!,Baloosmom,24 Jan 2024,The first time I used it we went to dinner and by the time we got to the restaurant my eyes were on fire from it running. I wiped it off probably 50 times and it continued to run with just water. So embarrassing!,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Never buying this again,minibrat,18 Jan 2024,Unfortunately even with primer on it‚Äôs a flaky mess. It goes on great and as soon as it dries you need to reapply it because it just crumbles all over your face. Even if you wipe you eye it falls off.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Pls make a water proof version!,emmawrubles,17 Jan 2024,"LOVE the wand of this mascara! lengthens and creates an illusion of a thick last line. However, I find the formula definitely smudges on upper and lower lids. I wish they had a water proof one",Tilbury,Mascara,No
worth the price my lashes look amaaaze,FrancescaP07,16 Jan 2024,"provides more length rather than volume, must buy if u like long but clean lashes. separates lashes and prevents the clumpy look.

COLOUR IS GORGEOUS !!!!!,nickyfog,15 Jan 2024,"Colour is brown at first glance but in the sunlight and in certain lightening it is definitely burgundy which is so unique. It is a little liquidy (wish it was a little more of a dryer formula) and I hope they come
 out with a waterproof version) Also -1 because this will start to get clumpy if you overdo it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Nothing spectacular,allisonvillegas,9 Jan 2024,"A pretty normal mascara, nothing special, it is good, but it‚Äôs not worth the price.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

I love Charlotte Tilbury in general and all the other products in the set, but wow this mascara was really disappointing. As soon as I put it on I regretted it. The product immediately made my eyes burn and flecks started getting in my eyes within seconds. I looked forward to taking my makeup off all day. I‚Äôd use the mascara again as a last resort, but unless I get desperate I won‚Äôt be reaching for it. I do not recommend.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Over-hyped lousy mascara-drugstore mascara better,juler,5 Jan 2024,"I bought a full-size mascara on Mercari. This apparently was a mistake, figured the seller had just let it dry out from disuse etc. So I bought the mini size on Sephora to compare. Well, what a disappointment. This mascara is very dry-barely does anything. I tried, I gave it every chance, but I've found most drugstore mascaras are better. You can apply 3 layers and still barely notice this mascara. The brush is not really a brush. Hard to describe--lets just say this mascara does not work well at all. I bought a mini of the ""better than sex"" mascara as well--Now there's a great mascara! Ms. Tilbury should put more effort into her products and less into her advertising. I have been disappointed in many of her products.--the ""wonder"" cream--not much of a wonder-I also have the pillow talk lip liner and lipstick--They are alright but nothing special. Just don't waste your money on this product. You will be as let-down as I was.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
It‚Äôs ok,Geslina,4 Jan 2024,"It‚Äôs a beautiful shade, and an alright mascara, but just not dark enough to really have any impact.  I think if you are really young and have nice thick long lashes, it would be great.  My lashes are longish, but fine and lighter towards the tips, so I need a darker brown that has a little oomph.  If I apply this heavily, to try to build it up, it just starts to look clumpy.  Won‚Äôt purchase it again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Awful,TifaLee,4 Jan 2024,"I tried this the day I got it and it was so dry. Nothing seemed to help, even soaking the tube in warm water. This is not worth your money. Color is gorgeous, I hope I can find another mascara in this shade.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Nothing better,glowgirl811,3 Jan 2024,"Okay, tell me why this only has 2.7 stars???? This is my fav mascara. I have tried other mascaras that were more expensive and nothing, and I mean nothing is better than this one. My eyelashes have never looked better. The length and volume is so beautiful!

ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE HYPE!,supercoolguy69,30 Dec 2023,"I got the travel size and was so excited, I never had tried any of the CTB products but this is a must have !! I have a ton of mascara but nothing compares to this one, it feels so lightweight on my lashes and makes you look sexy, so very flattering. Although I will say you have to have a good mind with mascara to be able to apply it correctly without any clumping (so like meticulous strokes and taking your time with application). It also smells really good, like a sweet perfume! so yes 10/10 do recommend, can def see the hype about the brand !! ü´∂üèº",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Beautiful Brown Lash Mascara,anniekatherine,20 Dec 2023,"I love this formula & get so many compliments on my eyelashes! 
I will say the wand is not favorite; I prefer them fluffy all around, but once you get the application process down, it creates beautifully long & full lashes. I love the brown <3 
It also doesn't clump. Definitely a favorite",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dry formula!,Rox12345,13 Dec 2023,Got this mascara because of the hype and wonderful reviews all these gurus were giving but when I tried it the formula was very dry! Made my lashes clumpy it was not flattering at all. I returned it,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Beautiful Formula BUT it Runs,Bonita2023,12 Dec 2023,"I have short and sparse lashes that need volume. I was gifted this mascara and the formula feels thick without feeling heavy and the brush achieves exactly what I needed it to; after applying this mascara, I look like I have double the lashes that appear longer without looking ""spidery"". My complaint is that this mascara runs and within an hour I look like a raccoon. I wanted this to work so badly I even adjusted the other products hoping it was my underage concealer or foundation and nothing helped. So, sadly I cannot use this mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Love the color, dislike applicator",ehallett,12 Dec 2023,"I haven‚Äôt experienced any formula issues like some other reviewers. The flat applicator is not great‚Ä¶one slight tilt of your hand at the wrong angle results in a blob of product on your lashes. I really like this color, however, and find myself reaching for it often. experienced",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Do not buy.,casie8586,11 Dec 2023,"This mascara is terrible.  It doesn't volumize or lengthen, I can barely get my lashes black.  It's a very dry formula and the brush makes it worse.  It's flat on the sides with a couple of rows of rubber bristles on opposite ends and no matter how long I work for it my lashes are stubby and faint.  It does wash off really well at the end of the day but if you accidentally get some on your face rather than the lashes during application, good luck because it does not come off.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Don‚Äôt buy this.,Maibeauty18,2 Dec 2023,This mascara is horrible. The brush is strange and it results in super clumpy lashes. Then it‚Äôs a mess to try and clean up your lashes from being clumpy. I do not recommend.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

It's a no.,BlugrassRedhead,2 Dec 2023,"I really didn't expect a high-end mascara to dry and flake worse than any drugstore brand I've ever used. Tiny black specks on my face all day! Very dry and the wand did not separate my lashes at all. Nothing but a overly hyped, marketed product. I will stick to the vitamin infused mascara from Almay that you can find anywhere under ten bucks.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Beautiful Mascara,JJRoservt,30 Nov 2023,Very beautiful pop off color. This is something I like to wear for everyday since it is less dramatic than black mascara. This pairs very well with my lash primer. It does not flake and holds a nice uplifted curl.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

not worth the price,Goretti8,27 Nov 2023,This mascara is one of the worst mascara I‚Äôve ever tried. It was so clumpy on my lashes and the product just flaked everywhere after it dried so wand is also not useful at all. way better mascaras for this price,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Sadly...not a fan,gennylou,26 Nov 2023,I had high hopes for this mascara...the CT line of products is typically spot on...this mascara missed the mark. Try as I might...little to no lengthening properties and is very flaky.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

5 stars for me,JustineBlackmon,24 Nov 2023,"I‚Äôm surprised this product doesn‚Äôt have better reviews bc I‚Äôm obsessed and it what I‚Äôve been reaching for almost daily!! I‚Äôm obsessed, gives length, gives volume and I just love it",Tilbury,Mascara,No
I use it for my everyday look.,logan108,23 Nov 2023,I have blonde lashes so black mascara looks weird on me. This is very natural and I use it as my everyday look. No one can tell I‚Äôm wearing it unless you look very close.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointed!,peony88,23 Nov 2023,"After using this product over the past few weeks, I realize that I don't like it because it did not make my lashes longer, it became flaky after a short time and was falling out under my eyes and cheeks. I tried repplying but it still did not make a difference. This mascara was really disappointing. I do not recommend this product.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Get the brown one!,Tach85,21 Nov 2023,"I suggest getting the brown mascara because it looks gorgeous on top of a white primer. The black mascara gives good length, but it made me look like a raccoon in less than half an hour.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dries Out Within a Week of Use,cremedecosmetics,20 Nov 2023,I didn't love the super small brush; it dried out within the week! It's one of the worst-performing mascaras I've ever purchased.

Lovely colour ‚Ä¶ terrible mascara,MuellerJD,19 Nov 2023,I find it is flaky and doesn‚Äôt stay in well. Color is beautiful though.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dries out in a month,mdendy,18 Nov 2023,Completely dries out within a month- terrible consistency I noticed after just a few weeks- clumpy. And it‚Äôs advertised as brown however it‚Äôs literally purple/burgundy. Couldn‚Äôt be more unhappy with an expensive mascara with pretty good overall reviews- don‚Äôt waste your money on this ‚Äúbrown‚Äù one at least.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Bad product,AceK,17 Nov 2023,"Not too sure what this product is for. Doesn't lengthen, doesn't volumize, smudges everywhere. Just a bad product.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Paint for your eyelashes,avesroseeee,8 Nov 2023,"I was so excited to use this because this brand is inclusive to red-heads/ pink people. The color is truly fantastic. Totally brings out my blue/gray/green eyes.
HOWEVER, I have had this product for 3 months now and it has totally dried out.. It does not do any volumizing or structuring for my lashes, it is simply just color. The word 'Paint' runs through my mind as I continue to use it because that is all its good for.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,oliviasherwood,8 Nov 2023,not what i was expecting. i‚Äôll put it on go about my day and its under my eyes by 12:00pm. they need a better formula.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,nazchow13,7 Nov 2023,"i like this colour but the brush puts me off, it‚Äôs more lengthening than volumizing",Tilbury,Mascara,No
New favorite,KarenH313,7 Nov 2023,I have been using this for a week and a half and I LOVE it. I wanted a brown mascara for my blue eyes and while this isn‚Äôt exactly brown it‚Äôs super complimentary.

still looking for a good cf mascara,e11even,6 Nov 2023,"horrible smudgy formula, terrible brush design. clumps insanely and have to comb it out with a lash brush to the point where i could have used any other mascara and it would have been the same",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Lash Extension Effect,perfaesthetic,28 Oct 2023,"The brush and formula are magic. People who find it hard to use must not wear makeup often... If you're a frequent mascara user, this is game changing. The brush separates every single lash with absolutely 0 clumps and gives you the most insane length, volume, and curl. I've never used anything like it. It quite literally ""pushes up"" and curls like no other mascara I've ever had before. I'm often asked if my lashes are real when I wear this! I wish I tried it sooner because my lashes never looked so good.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,greenleg,27 Oct 2023,Did not like it at all ended up with chunks of mascara on my eyelashes and had to get it off with a eyelash brush,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Glad I bought the small one to try!,LeeKei00,23 Oct 2023,"Thee worst mascara I have used! It does nothing for my lashes! It made my lashes look like spider legs. It didn‚Äôt make them longer, or give them volume.I understand this mascara isn‚Äôt waterproof, however if your eye even thinks about watering it runs and smears. Super disappointed!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
best on the go mascara for touch ups,ilovesephora44,21 Oct 2023,"one of my favorite mascaras! i love how it applies, especially the brush!! its flat, but the sides are spiky and separate my lashes really well! i do think that it actually is humidity proof, because when i wear it to amusement parks it doesn‚Äôt smudge !Ôøº",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,AnnaP15,19 Oct 2023,Got this as a sample from a previous purchase. It does lengthen; however it is a very wet formula. applying second coat and my lashes started clumping together. Will use as a bottom lash mascara rather than top lash,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Delyse13,17 Oct 2023,It's a good mascara but the wand is so hard to use it gets stuck on the roots of my lashes and is impossible to not make a mess of,Tilbury,Mascara,No

,LoveCoca,12 Oct 2023,The driest mascara I have ever attempted applying to my lashes. Literal garbage.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not for those with oily eyelids,KL03,10 Oct 2023,"I wanted to love this mascara as I've seen stunning results on others. 

unfortunately for me this formula is far too wet. As a result it transferred all over and smudged so easily. Within about 2 hours of wear it looks awful. 

The search for a transfet-proof mascara for oily eyelids continues.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Beautiful,annabelle95,10 Oct 2023,This is my favorite mascara ever! And honestly I think the wand isn‚Äôt the greatest‚Ä¶ like kinda even sucks. The wand has a flat side that I use to apply the formula and turn the other side and has the bristled to brush them out. But this mascara has my whole heart because of the beautiful color that makes my eyes pop. I get compliments on my eyes every time I pair this with the eyelinerhas my whole heart,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,alexaiscool,10 Oct 2023,This mascara makes your natural lashes look so beautiful‚Äî I feel as though it‚Äôs your lashes but better!! The mascara also lasts all day and layers which others really well!! My only gripe is it smudges an awful lot under my bottom lashes even when I only have mascara on my top:( for this reason I most likely won‚Äôt be repurchasing.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
save your money head to walgreens,sydneydrew,8 Oct 2023,"Luckily received a free sample I would never pay nearly $30 for a mascara that flakes smudges and clumps, this mascara is just not it and is overall a very basic mascara, you‚Äôre better off at the drug store",Tilbury,Mascara,No
A must have,moee323,6 Oct 2023,Love how this mascara stays all day and holds my curl. 10/10 will repurchase time and time again,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing,ywbbehs,3 Oct 2023,I freaking love this mascara. I honestly don‚Äôt know why it only has three stars. It curls and lengthens my lashes beautifully. I‚Äôve been using it for months and the bristles on the wand haven‚Äôt been damaged at all. AND it lasts all day,Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Must-have for natural, full looking lashes",brightpearlie,3 Oct 2023,"I‚Äôve always wanted this product, when I finally got it, I was not disappointed.
This mascara is amazing!
It gives my lashes a natural look and makes them full.
I love the color and the applicator, because it makes it very easy to apply the mascara.
I really like the packaging too, the handle is made out of a material that is cold so it is satisfying to hold in my hand.
Love Charlotte Tilbury for this!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Game changer!,redlipstickxx,29 Sep 2023,I‚Äôve tried seven different mascaras that didn‚Äôt work. A Sephora worker recommended I try the sample of this mascara since I have hooded eyes. This mascara is a game changer! I plan to buy the full size.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Why isn‚Äôt this viral!?,BreStewart,27 Sep 2023,The title says it all. This stuff is AMAZING. Doesn‚Äôt flake off even when I‚Äôve partied all night and slept in it! Wake up without Britney Spears eyes!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Samnoftall,25 Sep 2023,Not worth the hype packaging is cute but not much show off from product,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not sure if worth the price,cdavis85,23 Sep 2023,"Such a pretty unique brown that really coats the lashes. That being said, this is really lengthening but I don‚Äôt see much volume like the title claims, and I naturally have more lashes and I saw no improvement",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Disappointment üëéüèª,susanarivera,20 Sep 2023,"I bought this over a year ago because I always wanted to try a brown mascara and I was so disappointed. It does not last at all, you can barely see the color and it does not give any volume or push to the lashes. 
I expected more from this brand.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,mswntrs,19 Sep 2023,"love the wand and used to love the mascara, but it seems to dry out in a week. I thought maybe it was just the smaller size, but happened with this one. not worth the $",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Unique color, good wear.",kihar,18 Sep 2023,"The color is great for blue and green eyes. I often have mascara issues‚Äî mostly flaking but sometimes just smudging. For me, this stays in place.

Don‚Äôt buy,lscutt,18 Sep 2023,Worst mascara I‚Äôve ever used. It smudges nearly IMMEDIATELY- I‚Äôve tried applying multiple different ways and it always ended the same way,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smears,Maureenxxx,16 Sep 2023,"I didn't like this product much. Brush is flared but flat. Color is okay, as advertised. However, the thing I really didn't like was that it smeared. Every.Single.Day. Didn't matter when I put it on or what I did - it smeared. Even when I cleaned up around lunch, by the end of the day it had smeared again. Would not buy again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
IN LOVEEEEE,babyinfluence,15 Sep 2023,"From the first application I knew that I loved it, I already have long lashes but with this mascara it even makes them longer and voluminous!! I‚Äôm never buying another mascara other than this. Really amazing .",Tilbury,Mascara,No

"Smudges, Doesn‚Äôt last",JordanKohler,12 Sep 2023,"It smudges very easily and does not last long. The product does not allow your lashes to appear longer, thicker only darker. If this product lasted longer it would be good.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

My favorite mascara for top and bottom lashes,calbabe,9 Sep 2023,"I've tried almost every mascara these is, and this is my favorite. It coats every lash, top and bottom, and does not smudge.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
NOT waterproof/smudgeproof,wm1965,5 Sep 2023,"I was told this is a waterproof, but wash-off mascara (ie no make up remover needed) I found it was quite clumpy and it did leave rings under my eyes at the end of the day - thus not really waterproof",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Terrible,ashfay86,4 Sep 2023,"I am a huge mascara girl and I‚Äôve tried many different brands. This mascara is one of the worst mascaras I have ever tried.

,laurenpohlman1,25 Aug 2023,"i swear i have to wipe off a good amount of mascara on the brush because there's too much when taking the wand out of the tube. lashes get clumped up real easily, flakes and smudges throughout the day. i'd go back to my loreal telescopic any day over this. expected more out of this CT product, overall very disappointed.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
This brown on dark hair is a no.,maryoom,25 Aug 2023,I‚Äôm sure the black shade is fire but the brown shade was not it for me. I have dark brown (almost black) hair and prefer brown mascara because it softens my eyes abit but this mascara almost made my lashes look non-existent. It looked horrendous but maybe on lighter hair this will show up better. Opt for a darker brown if you want that softer eye look. The wand was great though I think that part was great.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
wouldn‚Äôt get it in black but love dream pop,maddiebagot,24 Aug 2023,i love the color of the dream pop but the formula and the brush isn‚Äôt the best out there. the brush is weirdly flat and the formula can be a bit spidery. love it only for the color that looks great with hazel/green eyes or a brown smoky look,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Flat and short lashes,madisynkinsman,24 Aug 2023,"I love this brands products, but this was a miss for me. My lashes are naturally decently curly and I feel it straightened them out bc of the brush. It made them appear shorter than they are.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Never again,HB24601,19 Aug 2023,I received it as a sample.  It‚Äôs the worst.  Flaked all over my undereyes.  Not impressive enough at volume and length to make up for that!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
My go to mascara,AmandaJaya,16 Aug 2023,I‚Äôve tried many brands of mascara but since I found this one I keep buying it over and over. I have been trying others but I don‚Äôt feel that I get the same results. It builds really well and my lashes look long and full.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

less than drug store quilty just don't.,romaprincess,7 Jul 2023,listen I don't know what some of y'all did to make this mascara work besides being blessed by eyelash gods but you're paying for the name for a less than drug store mascara.  I couldn't even eyelash curler these to death to make it look good now I just stare at my smudgy flaky expensive mascara being mad I'd even buy it. try huda beauty mascara that will redeem your mascara life this isn't it and doesn't even belong at the drug store super disspointed.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

"Not the best, not the worst.",mynameisntkatie,27 Jun 2023,"I really wanted to like this mascara because I‚Äôve been looking for a maroon/berry one, this one doesn‚Äôt hold up sadly.

I like it but don‚Äôt love it,lyssnorton,27 Jun 2023,"I like the mascara, especially cuz the flat edge of the brush and spiky sides let‚Äôs you really reshape your lashes and gives them lift and volume, but the formula is wet and smears like crazy :(",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Stunning colour.,AngBean,26 Jun 2023,"Firstly, I get compliments every time I wear this mascara. The colour is very unique and beautiful. The formula and applicator is good, not great, but workable considering the gorgeous colour. Four stars just because I believe a few tweaks to the formula and applicator would make it just about perfect. But the colour definitely makes up for those slight imperfections.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,jlr22,25 Jun 2023,"I would give this mascara 0 stars if I could. I hate everything about it, but mostly how it looks on my dark brown lashes. The reddish color just clings to the ends and it looks really odd.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Pretty but doesn‚Äôt last,gvllian,21 Jun 2023,"I want to love this product.

Holy lashes!!!,BarnieBee,18 Jun 2023,For those (like me) who have lashes so fair and short they might as well not exist I cannot recommend this product enough!! The Dream Pop color is *perfect* for creating a natural but better look. The photo attached is after 2 coats. With additional coats it would be perfect for an evening out for us pale people! Love it so much!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
It‚Äôs ok‚Ä¶,cloudfluff,14 Jun 2023,"I was excited to try this product but was disappointed. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love the cute and girly packaging but the formula is not it. For the price, I was expecting a little more. It‚Äôs definitely not volumizing! It‚Äôs just lengthening and not by much either. If you‚Äôd like a very natural everyday lash look, this would be great for you!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointing,lb12,13 Jun 2023,"Flakes everywhere within a few hours. Love the wand and application, but the smudging and flaking are way too excessive to continue using. I‚Äôve used this in warm, humid weather and cold, dry weather- it‚Äôs all the same. And I ONLY wore on my top lashes, never bottom, and it still ran and flaked down my face. Would not recommend.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudges!!,Reese2020,13 Jun 2023,The wand was a learning on how to use and not make my lashes look clumpy but I can‚Äôt get over the smudging. It will look good for maybe a few hours but it will smudge and transfer to your under eye and on to your eyeshadow on your lid,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Solid Product,StephTuts,12 Jun 2023,I accidentally purchased the berry brown.  I didn't feel it was dark enough for my liking but just personal preference. I did end up purchasing the black.  I do like this product and would say it compares to my favorite brands: Thrive and Chanel. I like the flat applicator for 2 different application options.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best Burgundy Mascara,VBoss,10 Jun 2023,"Loove the color of this mascara, it really makes my blue eyes pop. And the color is apparent enough that my SIL asked me if i was wearing burgundy mascara. The wand is a slight learning curve though. I use the flat side to applyy the product to the lashes and then the side with the brush to seperate and place them after.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,ParadiseDolly7,10 Jun 2023,"I‚Äôm not one to write a review but after searching relentlessly for a good mascara. I decided to try to one out. I have short lashes and usual opt for false lashes, but let me tell you the volume and length is WOW. You will not regret buying this!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointing,Talulahsmom,9 Jun 2023,"I am so sad, because I wanted to love this mascara! I love the color, but the mascara itself is terrible. It is not buildable, it clumped my eyelashes immediately, and I hate the wand. So sad!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,melkatte,8 Jun 2023,"Love the formula, volume, and length I get from this mascara. It‚Äôs also buildable. I recommend it if you are in the mood to splurge.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
The Best!,michi5,6 Jun 2023,I got this product in my rewards and I absolutely love it. I have short lashes and this wand lengthens my lashes and lifts my eye look. I have not used a mascara that makes this impact in my look before.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
The best mascara,kenny76468965,5 Jun 2023,I actually found this at winners and decided to try. BEST MASCARA TO EVER TOUCH MY EYELASHES. LOVE LOVE LOVE. It makes them look so good and curled. BUY IT!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Skip for Asian lashes,jels01,3 Jun 2023,"Started off great for the first hour or so but sometime throughout the day, I ended up looking like a hot mess. I curl my very straight downward Asian lashes and apply 2-3 coats whenever I use mascara. It smudged all over the top of my monolids and even under my eyes. By the end of the day the heavier wet formula pulled my lashes down.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Too Flakey :(,sucreholic,2 Jun 2023,"I picked this up 'cos I LOST my holy grail, CT Legendary Lashes Vol. 2, SOMEWHERE and all my other mascaras were not cutting it lol. I wanted to see if this one held up, since reviewers on here seemed to prefer this one to my fav? And unfortunately, it does not. I'm not a fan of the brush, which I thought would do well @ least on my bottom lashes but it DIDN'T, and the formula itself gives me terrrrrible flaking throughout the day. Absolutely decimates my undereye area. I've tried a lot of mascaras and CT products over the years, and this one is my least favourite on both counts!! Sorry :(",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Fantastic Mascara,sharka,30 May 2023,"This is a fantastic mascara. It's a beautiful brown, makes lashes long and full, the color is very rich, no smudging so far. I do use the Milk lash primer with all mascaras. I am so impressed with this mascara that I will be purchasing the black one to try as well. Typically I use Benefit's BADgal BANG or Sephora Big by Definition. This CT is my new addition to the 2 favorites.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointment,Stubeane,28 May 2023,"I wanted to love this mascara but didn't. It is super clumpy, somehow smudges/runs and is difficult to wash off. Will not be purchasing again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Good color for redheads but smudgy,lolomojo,27 May 2023,"Great color for redheads in particular. I love that it looks less harsh on me than dark brown or black. However, this is one of the worst smudging mascaras I‚Äôve ever used. I like the color enough that I‚Äôll likely get a lash primer to use with it, but it lost points for me for not being a standalone product.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
The best mascara I've ever tried,MEDalton,27 May 2023,This is hands down the best mascara I've ever tried. It goes on so smooth--with no clumps at all. I highly recommend!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not for me,mrsJlew,26 May 2023,It makes lashes look fake and clumped together. It doesn‚Äôt make them have full appearance.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Flop!,weeva,24 May 2023,"If I could rate this 0 stars I would. So hard to apply and once you do apply it, it has dried down way too quickly to work with. Once applied and looking somewhat decent at best, you have a 45 minutes before it flakes offgood 45 m",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudges,Vichka,22 May 2023,"Offers nice length and volume, but smudges under eyes within 2 hours. Won‚Äôt be repurchasing.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not for straight lashes. Smudge galore!,Hayehaye,20 May 2023,"Not for straight lashes, even after it‚Äôs curled. It‚Äôs a thicker mascara that pushes the lashes up for a short while but eventually falls and leaves smudges on my lower eye. Best for lashes that stay up w/o help. Multiple failed attempts.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
straight lashes!,jnj707,19 May 2023,"i have straight lashes and this does the opposite of what it says. does not push ur eyelashes up sadly. in fact even when i curl them, they droop back down after using this",Tilbury,Mascara,No
OBSESSED,hawtgirl77,18 May 2023,"By far best mascara I‚Äôve ever used, and I own over 20. It doesn‚Äôt make your lashes look so thin it‚Äôs invisible and gives the clumpy but not clumpy affect that I‚Äôve been looking for all my life.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Berry Brown is So Good,Nicxlette,11 May 2023,I was WAITING for this to come back because I was dying to try out berry brown. Now honestly ‚Äî I do get slight raccoon eye if I don‚Äôt bake but I think it‚Äôs so pretty nonetheless!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love the length and volume!!,ilovesephora589,10 May 2023,"Pros: This mascara gives fluttery lashes in just 1 coat! The packaging is also very high quality and chic. 
Cons: If you want long lasting curl, this mascara does not compete with others.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love love lovee,CharlieeChar,9 May 2023,"I freaking love this mascara. As someone with green eyes, I got so many compliments the first time I wore it and I keep getting them !! It‚Äôs super easy to remove and it doesn‚Äôt smudge.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
New every-day mascara,madisonlindsay,9 May 2023,"I‚Äôm very picky with mascara, and I‚Äôve been on the hunt for the perfect brown mascara that shows up on my darker eyelashes and makes a statement - but isn‚Äôt too bold, and this does just that. It separates my lashes nicely. The only downside is that it does not hold a curl very well.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,infinitehope47,8 May 2023,I almost never purchase such expensive mascara but this one made me reconsider. This is amazing! I love the size of the brush for my smaller eyes. This is also one of the only mascaras I‚Äôve tried that hasn‚Äôt flaked off throughout the day.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love love love this brown mascara !!!,luvmycozmetics,7 May 2023,"Best brown mascara !! The wand is nice and thin which I love, the colour is perfect with my strawberry blonde hair and it stays on all day and washes off nicely at night. My new favourite mascara !!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Raccoon eyes,Angelash1,5 May 2023,From now on I will start trusting 1star reviews better!! Truly the most raccoon eyes from lashes that don‚Äôt even look great mascara ever!! I am baffled,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Worth the Price,sunbum1018,5 May 2023,After using this product in the matter of 6 hours with me running errands sweating and crying the lashes have not only stayed lifted but there was no flaking of the product. It‚Äôs worth switching from my all time fave better than sex mascara,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Buy itttttüòç,nadiyaloz,5 May 2023,"I don‚Äôt get the bad comments, it‚Äôs literally amazing! Curls, elongates the lashes very well. Doesn‚Äôt flake, stays on. Easy to apply. And the color dream pop is to die for, so unique looking. Gives you a sexy kinda vibe. Love it!!!!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Does not hold curl,DaisyDu0716,4 May 2023,"First of all, I LOVE the colour of this mascara. However, my lashes fell stuck straight as soon as I put it on. I even tried curling my lashes with a heated eye lash curler (which always works amazingly, especially with waterproof mascara) and they still went board straight. Disappointing.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Ezquivel25,2 May 2023,Love this mascara love the color glides smooth and it‚Äôs cute color product,Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Goes on lovely, by 12pm, all over bottom lash line",BirdieGirl1996,30 Apr 2023,"My opinion on this mascara is so mixed. Here‚Äôs the good:  First, I love the wand.  The shape is great.  Second, I love how it looks on my eyes when I put it on.  It makes them look long and luxurious without it being overkill for those days when I want a more natural look. Third, it doesn‚Äôt aggravate my sensitive, dry eyes. Here‚Äôs the one negative- after a few hours, about four of so, I have raccoon eyes.  The mascara that looked so pretty on my eyes at eight am, now has formed a dry, dark grey half circle under my bottom lashes, where I have not even put the mascara. Certainly, this can be a look under certain circumstances, but not where I work. I am going to try with a lash primer, because I really want to like this!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,OmiHeidi,29 Apr 2023,"This is the worst mascara I have bought. It is very wet and a shiny black which literally clumped my lashes together. I did try it one more time with the same result. I was told it was the best mascara, what a huge disappointment.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
I don‚Äôt get the hate?,msca3,27 Apr 2023,"Seriously, did everyone get a bad batch or am I a fluke? The color is gorgeous- it does pull a bit redder while it‚Äôs drying down so don‚Äôt let that scare you! I prefer a silicone wand anyway, and I love the way it catches every lash and separates them, I can definitely build up the intensity depending on my look, and it has yet to flake on me. Also the component itself has a nice weight to it, very lux, I just wish the brown came in a travel size!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Horrible,skyessworldd,26 Apr 2023,Took me 30 minutes trying to apply this because it was dried out and had nothing in it. Was excited to try but very disappointed.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointing,AlisaKeehl,24 Apr 2023,"I like Charlotte Tilbury products but this one was a huge disappointment. It does nothing to your lashes, gives no volume or length at all. I had to return it",Tilbury,Mascara,No
My new favourite!,sienna38,22 Apr 2023,"I have dry, sensitive eyes, so it's hard for me to find a product that works well and doesn't contribute to irritation. I've been using Clinique for years, but lately developed some reaction to it. Tried this mascara because I loved Legendary lashes, but only need a mini size. This one works great - no reaction, lashes look longer and thicker, great separation. I literally have nothing negative to say about it, so I thought I'd write a review because its low rating is shocking to me.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Waste of money,girlyeyes,21 Apr 2023,Everything about this mascara is horrible. I have pretty decent lashes and this does absolutely nothing to lengthen or create volume to them. It is very dry and flakes under my eyes. The applicator/wand is the worst I've ever tried.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Container was empty,sixofharts,20 Apr 2023,"I thought I‚Äôd give the CT brand a try so I bought the travel size for a quick trip out of town. I went to use it and found that it was empty, no useable mascara at all. I was quite disappointed.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
smudgy,chers,19 Apr 2023,"always smudges under my eyes after a few hours of wear. I like the applicator and think it looks good on the lashes, but not worth it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Color is GORG,ellieakline,19 Apr 2023,"these ratings are super harsh.. i‚Äôm
the pickiest when it comes to mascara formulas, and this one doesn‚Äôt really bother me. it‚Äôs not my favorite, I love tarte tartlette because tubing mascaras work best for me, but if I had to pick an alternative this mascara could probably do the job. not to mention the color is absolutely gorgeous on green eyes! it dries kind of quickly but other than that my lashes looked great after applying this mascara",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Will Never Buy Again,Angeezy5,18 Apr 2023,"The brush is awful, it doesnt distribute the mascara and just clumps up, don't buy this mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Causes clumpy eyelashes,natchi1990,18 Apr 2023,"Really disappointed in this mascara, made my lashes clump immediately on application. Not worth the price.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
plz do not buy.,abbyc118,17 Apr 2023,this is the worst mascara i‚Äôve ever put on my lashes. it‚Äôs extremely dry and by the end of the day it had all fallen off and left residue under my eyes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Kelsey13xo,16 Apr 2023,i had high hopes for this mascara. it is absolutely terrible. it does NOTHING to your lashes but make them stiff. the brush is terrible and the formula is awful. i regret even buying the small size. my go to drug store marches puts this to shame,Tilbury,Mascara,No
OK BUT COULD BE BETTER,Cherry0901,16 Apr 2023,It took me a while to get used to the applicator and I still don‚Äôt like this product. The formula isn‚Äôt friendly on straight Asian lashes and the product smudges after 30 minutes. WILL NOT BUY AGAIN,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Hard Pass,kaceeeeeeeeeee,15 Apr 2023,"It was time for a fresh mascara, so I visited my local store and low and behold the store wasn‚Äôt stocked with really much of anything so I thought I would give this mascara a try to my disappointment. It did nothing but transfer onto my brow bone and it is absolutely terrible. I am a big Charlotte Tillberry fan and I use most of their products, but this one was very very disappointing.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
HIGHLY recommend,alliekg,12 Apr 2023,"I have been using this for over a week and I absolutely love this mascara! I have used and tested several different mascaras in different price and wand ranges (Chanel, Better Than Sex, Elf, Telescopic, etc.). This mascara has worked the best and has even worked better than my usual favorite which is Chanel.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Love the wand, but the formula is so dry!",gcgcgc123,11 Apr 2023,"I got a sample of this and it was AMAZING, but when I bought the full size the formula was horrible. It is such a bummer because the wand works SO week. Seriously I get compliments on my lashes anytime I use the mascara. But the formula is so dry and clumps very easily that is is hard to use. I‚Äôm considering trying to clean off the wand and is it with a different mascara formula. So if you don‚Äôt care about the formula give it a try and you won‚Äôt regret it, but definitely keep in mind that the formula is horrible.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Do not purchase this,maexo95,11 Apr 2023,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. This is the WORST mascara I have ever purchased. Even with an eye lash curler, my lashes fall and have no length no volume nothing. I have purchased better mascara at CVS. Do not waste $31 on this mascara, bad girl bang is 10000% better.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,roma21,10 Apr 2023,The worst mascara I ever have . Not recommended at all,Tilbury,Mascara,No
DO NOT BUY,tephiemaeee,10 Apr 2023,"Such a sad disappointment! The one star is for the gorgeous color. I am an avid hourglass extreme caution mascara user, but want brown for the summer. I was so excited about this color, but the mascara is like using a cheap drugstore brand, if not worse! It does NOTHIng. In fact, I think my lashes are better w out it! It is not buildable, it doesn‚Äôt lengthen and it certainly doesn‚Äôt curl. It‚Äôs AWFUL. I feel like Charlotte tilbury products are way over hyped and this didn‚Äôt fall short of that stereotype . Huge flop. Good thing Sephora allows returns!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
WORST MASCARA,payjxo,8 Apr 2023,"this is the WORST mascara i have ever purchased. the bristles are small & sparse only on the edges of the brush, the rest is completely flat. also there isn‚Äôt much product & it dries up quickly.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dream pop is a dreamy shade,gemmabean,4 Apr 2023,"Ok so first of all I love this mascara mainly for the color. I saw it used in a video and the artist had blue eyed and it was a stunning look, I have brown eyes and it's just as stunning. It makes my eyes look warmer and brings out greens and golds that black mascara otherwise hides. The applicator isn't the greatest like others have said (but I did get better at using it over time) and if you apply to much it can be flakey, but honestly I haven't found a mascara yet that hasn't had its issues. To help with these issues I just use an extra spooly to evenly distribute the product and make sure there isn't an area with it globbed on (the only time I really had flaking is when one section of my lashes had too much product on it). For me the weird brush doesn't out weigh the absolute stunning color. I pair it with a dark brown liner and when I want to get real fancy do a smuggy brown smokey eye. I have gotten so many compliments since wearing the shade dream pop. Drug store maroon mascaras or brown/blacks just don't compare so I am willing to put up with doing an extra spooly swish.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Faulty product.,Paigelancelot,3 Apr 2023,Used this mascara and loved it. Bought it a second time and the wand came broken and I was told I couldn‚Äôt get a replacement. Very unfortunate.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Meh save your money,Dee824929,3 Apr 2023,I wanted to love it! First it came almost nearly empty‚Ä¶idk if they‚Äôre just packed like that. Second it weighed my lashes down. And lastly I cried with it on and I felt like my eyeballs were going to explode. I wish I was exaggerating but I‚Äôve cried with mascara on and it‚Äôs stung but it‚Äôs gone away fast. But thi mascara had me crying and in pain because idk if it‚Äôs the chemicals in this but they were BEYOND strong. Overall this mascara was a 0/10 and it was so expensive for nothing !,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Could be better,ii2000,2 Apr 2023,"Helps your lashes look really long and natural. Great for lengthening but doesn't offer much volume. In addition, I notice my lashes don't stay curled and the formula flakes throughout the day.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
A new staple,bLtSammich,2 Apr 2023,I LOVE this mascara. The berry color is absolutely phenomenal and makes my blue eyes pop. It doesn‚Äôt flake or smudge and is able to hold a curl. I will never be without this. I love everything about it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

,lilymac14,28 Mar 2023,Great results! My lashes look so much longer. I‚Äôve gotten so many compliments!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Do not buy!,cortezthekiller,25 Mar 2023,"This is the absolute worst mascara I have ever tried. I bought the brown berry shade so can't speak to the black one. The product literally evaporates off my eyelashes. It doesn't transfer so I don't know where it goes but within an hour it looks like my lashes are completely bare. It also immediately straightens my lashes. My lashes look good without mascara on, this product makes them look bad. Even when I curl my lashes this makes them droop low. It's so weird. Something in the formula must have a straightening effect on my eyelashes. I only apply two light coats so it's not like I've weighed them down. For the high price this mascara is outrageously bad. Buyer beware.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Leaned towards drugstore mascaras and bigger wands,emmali30,24 Mar 2023,"Was super hesitant to buy this mascara because it was everything that I didn't look for when buying mascaras. I disliked high end mascaras because (from experience) felt that they didn't do anything for my lashes so I loved drugstore mascaras, specifically Maybelline Lash Sensational. Another thing is that I love mascaras with big bristles and a big, hourglass shaped wand so I was extra hesitant to buy this one with such a tiny wand and bristles. But I bought it and instantly LOVED IT. Was surprised it did so much for my lashes, even more than drugstore mascaras in fact! Was so pleasantly surprised with this. Also, the color is absolutely stunning. I have black hair and black lashes but the brown color of this was still quite evident. Especially standing in natural sunlight, your lashes will be a beautiful burgundy/red color. This mascara definitely draws attention to the eyes. Stunning and will absolutely be repurchasing!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Holy Grail Mascara,krisper29,23 Mar 2023,"I love this mascara it‚Äôs one of my top 3 favorites! It gives me separation, lift & length. I don‚Äôt get mascara under eyes throughout the day, no clumps & it‚Äôs easy to wash off at night!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
What a Mess!,MLSonk,23 Mar 2023,Clumpy mess. Looked like tar going on. And was a mess to remove as well. Such a shame because I usually love Tilbury products.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

It‚Äôs alright,ZillyW,21 Mar 2023,"I wanted to love this, but honestly it can clump really easy. You either have to do very few coats carefully or you want the clumpy look. There‚Äôs not an easy in between and I‚Äôm pretty decent at applying mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,VIBRougeDani,20 Mar 2023,The color is unmatched for my amber/hazel eyes. But the formula is so clumpy/flaky and dries out so fast. I recommend adding a few drops of argan oil directly to the tube when it starts getting too dry.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not a winner for me,bread1337,19 Mar 2023,Not for me. Super clumpy when applying and would flake off. The applicator was cool but it just didn't work out for me. I threw it out before even finishing the tube because it was such a pain to deal with.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

A must have!,BrightonJ,16 Mar 2023,I just bought my second one! Best mascara I‚Äôve found. You have to get used to the wand but once you do it separates and lifts so well!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Flakey Panda Eyes,VaporTrail,15 Mar 2023,"I love some of the CT products, but this is not one of them. It flakes so badly even minutes after application, and there's nothing notable about it otherwise. I've honestly used better drugstore mascaras than this. Don't waste your money.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudges terribly,allmother,15 Mar 2023,"Very kind of Sephora to give me a deluxe sample so I could become thoroughly acquainted with how much I dislike this mascara. The brush is interesting and I get great volume from it but an hour later I look like I‚Äôve been punched in the face from how bad it smudges. My skin isn‚Äôt particularly oily, I wait until long after my skincare absorbs, and I rarely wear foundation or anything else that would affect its staying power. It‚Äôs just an awful formula.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Favorite!,kait839201,14 Mar 2023,Closest thing I‚Äôve ever used to flash lashes! I absolutely HATE false lashes but this mascara make my natural lashes look just like extensions! This is my go to favorite! I really like the wand too!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
absolute best mascara ever!,erica2022,11 Mar 2023,"I have tried every mascara out there and this is by far the best. It separates lashes, it lengthens lashes, it volumizes lashes, it darkens lashes to the deepest black and it does not flake or smear!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Definitely a must have

,chloebell12903,9 Mar 2023,If you are looking for purely thickening and darkening this is not bad but it adds no length there are much better drugstore ones,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dream pop is so pretty!,Antisocialite21,8 Mar 2023,"Using the wand was a bit of a learning curve, but once I got the hang of it, it worked very nicely. It doesnt make my lashes look the longest or the fullest, but the colour (dream pop) is so pretty.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Buy something else,lemonsodapie,8 Mar 2023,"I checked the reviews first before I purchased. I was in-need of a new mascara and thought I‚Äôd try a new one. I was skeptical because of the mixed reviews for this product but I still went with it. The first time I used it, I didn‚Äôt know how to utilize the mascara wand and after wearing it for 2 hours, it smudged under my eyes. I gave this another try today and maybe if I applied it the way it‚Äôs supposed to, it wouldn‚Äôt smudge! but it‚Äôs a no-no. The only good thing about this is that it makes your eyelashes pop out with how black the product is but other than that, save your money and grab something else.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Did Not Like At All,Maureenxxx,6 Mar 2023,This mascara smudged under my eyes every single day. It took a long time to wipe off. I did not like the flat brush. It did nothing to enhance my eyelashes,Tilbury,Mascara,No
AMAZING,xJLK821x,4 Mar 2023,I‚Äôm a little confused by other comments but personally I love this mascara. The formula is wet but when it dries your lashes are soft. It‚Äôs also super easy to remove. I love how pigmented it is! Lashes are super dark. I Recommend,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Must have,MyMaione,3 Mar 2023,By far the best mascara i have ever tried.  It‚Äôs hard finding the right mascara that isn‚Äôt thick or clumpy and stays on your lashes nicely all day.  Everyone compliments me on having fake eyelashes but it‚Äôs really just the mascara.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

"Wanted to love, too messy",melsyp,27 Feb 2023,Received this as a sample. I wanted to love it but it‚Äôs just so messy. Transfers to the skin very easily and is really hard to get off once it‚Äôs on the skin as it smudges a lot and then looks dark around the eye.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Terrible,drycreek,26 Feb 2023,"Terrible. The formula is so thick and more like a paste, it‚Äôs too thick to get it on the lashes. The wand is more of a rubber material it does not pick up the formula. Really bad.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Raccoon Eyes What!?,KateRussHaines,26 Feb 2023,"I was so excited to purchase this mascara and to say I was disappointed is an understatement.

Too red for me.,japanese,24 Feb 2023,"I wanted to like this color so bad. However it‚Äôs very brick red. If you like the color, then this is for you. I was looking for a natural brown mascara. But I kept it",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Best Mascara,kec91,21 Feb 2023,"Everyone stops to ask what fake lashes I wear. When I tell them they are my natural lashes, they ask what mascara I use. It‚Äôs how you use the brush that makes them look like falsies. You have to use the flat side first to load it up and then the bristle side to comb them through. I had multiple friends dislike it until I shoeed them how to use the brush. Now it‚Äôs all they use!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,trishabeans,19 Feb 2023,I got the berry brown shade and it‚Äôs absolutely beautiful. It‚Äôs my go to daytime mascara. I have very fair skin and red hair and this shade compliments me perfectly,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not worth it,SavannahFarris,19 Feb 2023,Mascara does not lengthen and barely give you any volume. It also does not last more than an hour. Not worth it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Just OKÔøº,lilivancamp,19 Feb 2023,ÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº Nice if you would like a subtle look however as very little volume and basically no lengthÔøº,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Don‚Äôt waste your money,chlovr,18 Feb 2023,Worst mascara I ever bought. Don‚Äôt waste your money. Pharmacy mascara will do a better job! It makes my eyelashes look so short and sick. Hate it! I was looking for the caliray mascara (my usual) but it was out of stock.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Lilysav,17 Feb 2023,"Terrible. First time opening, it was incredibly dry and wouldn‚Äôt even go on. Left flakes all over my under eyes. Not worth any $.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Great mascara but too flaky,kk20172023,12 Feb 2023,Amazing mascara but can‚Äôt recommend it because it flakes and gets smudged too easy. I literally have black under my eyes within a few hours. It really is a bummer.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
could be better ;(,lesliiiys,10 Feb 2023,"3 1/2. Love the color but hate the formula, it's so dry and clumpy, (literally researching ways to make it better and not as heavy because I just love the way the color pops but the formula is so bad, it's horrible).",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Big let down,juglenn,9 Feb 2023,Unfortunately this is not a good mascara. The formula is pretty dry and the pretty brown color I was influenced to buy (jokes on me) is very subtle and hard to notice even over a white primer. Way overpriced and doesn‚Äôt lengthen.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Absolute disappointment,SpiritoLibero,7 Feb 2023,Again influenced to buy Charlotte Tilbury mascara and this one is worse than the first one she put out. Complete waste of money. If I lived near a store I would take it back but to much of a hassle otherwise.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Game changer! My new holy grail,Mochibug,7 Feb 2023,"I was looking for a true brown mascara because I have light hair/skin/eyes (blonde, blue for reference) and felt like black mascara always looked way too harsh on me and had trouble finding a brown mascara that actually looked brown instead of brown-black. Decided after a thorough internet sweep of brown mascaras to try this one and I am absolutely obsessed! It looks so soft on me exactly how I‚Äôd hoped, I feel like it looks like it was made for me and makes me feel so beautiful. It‚Äôs also really buildable so you can go for a natural or dramatic look without it looking too harsh if you have light lashes. The formula and brush are great in my opinion, I was worried it would be difficult to use after reading some reviews but I find I always get a great application. The brush is great for coating the lash and combing out clumps and is great for a clean application on the bottom lash as well, I also find it‚Äôs the least messy out of any mascara I‚Äôve used and doesn‚Äôt leave a mess on my eyelids after I apply it. The formula is wet and slow drying enough to coat the lashes well and comb out clumps but quick drying enough that it doesn‚Äôt make a mess which I love! If you have straight lashes like me that don‚Äôt hold a curl the hold is decent but not as good as a waterproof mascara, although I find it stays looking beautiful all day regardless. It‚Äôs also super easy to remove which is great for my sensitive eyes but isn‚Äôt smudgy and stays on all day! This mascara has seriously changed my life, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever go back to black mascara, it looks so natural on me but makes my lashes look so long and full! If you‚Äôre looking for a brown mascara this is the way to go!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
It dries out fast,MarinaBobina123,6 Feb 2023,"I got a sample of this in the mail and liked it so much I decided to buy it. My first tube stayed hydrated for about a week and a half before drying out. So I got a second tube thinking the first was a dud, but the second tube also dried out after a week and a half. I know its not me because I havent had this issue with other mascaras before. Its a shame because for the week that it is hydrated it looks absolutely amazing.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Try if yourself,maycow,5 Feb 2023,I really wanted to love this but I‚Äôm dissatisfied :/ you can‚Äôt really see the color after going through with the wand multiple times. Unless you stare long enough. Also not a fan of the formula. A for effort though.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Lashes Fo Dayz,Lissi18,2 Feb 2023,"LOOKS GORGEOUS!! It‚Äôs my favorite mascara for any kind of look. The contrast of the colors is wonderful! I have pretty good sized natural lashes, and it makes them look even longer! It‚Äôs not clumpy at all either!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not the best option at Sephora,wondergir1ie,2 Feb 2023,Wanted to love it but‚Ä¶. Wand was difficult and made getting the mascara on my eyelids always a possibility.  Then 2days of wearing I got an eye irritation that caused me to look 1/2 asleep.  No thanks returned,Tilbury,Mascara,No

TRY THIS!,AllyPagan,1 Feb 2023,I love the wand and the formula! It doesn‚Äôt flake or fade throughout the day nor does it smudge. It also stays true to the name I get the length and volume in one!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Flaky AF but NO ONE has a color like this,itskatienyc,31 Jan 2023,"Saw a beauty guru wearing this mascara on tiktok and HAD to find it. I searched EVERYWHERE for a dupe and everything I found still looked black on my dark eyelashes. I gave in and bought this original CT one and I am AMAZED at how pigmented it is. It‚Äôs almost a brick red color rather than brown. Be warned tho, it flakes like crazy if you wear it all day. it‚Äôs best for a different look for a night out than daily wear.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Do not purchase this mascara,DaniGirl7,30 Jan 2023,"I received this as part of my birthday gift last year. It is amongst the worst mascaras I‚Äôve ever used.

Do not recommend.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Terrible,JusAH,29 Jan 2023,Got the sample mini and it was great! So I went for the full size and it was awful - clumpy and too much product. I returned it - going to stick with my go-to Ilia limitless mascara,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Amazing. I love.,Sienanana,25 Jan 2023,"I love this mascara so much. It gives a very natural look while still managing to lift my lashes and make them very noticeable.

"Only okay, not worth the $$",Wendy5733,21 Jan 2023,"Definitely not volumizing. Does a decent job at lengthening and is very light feeling, but doesn‚Äôt really layer well enough to give you any volume. It‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre looking for a very natural look, but not for me",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Absolutely Not!,Beabebe,19 Jan 2023,"I really wanted to love this mascara because I absolutely love the undereye color corrector, however, I absolutely hated this mascara!

Better Options Out There,CountryGirlxo,16 Jan 2023,"While the effect on the lashes is good (but not shockingly better than another product), this product constantly transfered to my eyelids.

The title of what the mascara claims to do is misleading, it doesn't lengthen or have a volumizing effect on the lashes. The only positive is that the colour is extremely black and the formula is creamy, which can smear easily if you have watery eyes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dry As A Bone,chaychan,14 Jan 2023,"The mini size is super dry right out of the package. No mascara was ever brushed onto my lashes because there was absolutely none to be found in the bottle. I dabbed the wand onto my hand several times and only a small speck of mascara showed up.

Would give 0 stars if I could.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

My fave mascara ever,Lenacpl,30 Dec 2022,My holy grail mascara. Looks like I'm wearing natural-looking falsies when I use it -- super buildable without being clumpy. I know it's not for everyone -- my mom tried it and didn't like it -- but it works super well on my lashes. I guess it really comes down to your own lashes and the look you're going for.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Personal opinion: Not worth it.,CBP4,29 Dec 2022,"This product was recommended to me as a red head. I thought it would darken my lashes but still look natural. While it gives my lashes a bit more volume, it's hard to tell I'm wearing any mascara; the colour looks completely natural. If that's the look you're going for, it's a great product. If you are hoping to darken the shade of red you already have, go for a dark brown. This won't do the trick.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

not good,bluecaroline,19 Dec 2022,One of the worst mascaras I've used. I have pretty straight eyelashes so I am always looking for something to help give them volume and hold a curl.

Love it!,Elibad,13 Dec 2022,"I love this mascara.  I have long naturally curled lashes that can actually be a bit of a pain to put mascara on but the wand in this mascara is prefect.  I can use the flat side to get all my lashes covered with with  swipe for the tips then use the brush to comb it out and get them to sit the way I want.  My only wish would be a waterproof version, I tent to be oily and sweaty under my eyes and due to the length, my bottom lash often make contact with my skin and this leads to racoon eyes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Mascara up under my eyes every afternoon,KelsChristal,4 Dec 2022,I really like the design of this product. The brush is flat and different from a normal mascara brush but my lashes look so long after using it. I love the look I get right after using it but every day I end up with mascara under my eyes. I haven't had this problem with other brands at a similar price point so I won't be buying this one again. I really wanted to love it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
If you like the undead look this might be for you.,metalgrrl,3 Dec 2022,This was a little tricky to use because it came out so dry. When I finally got it on it looked okay so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. Hour 5 in my shift at work I finally see myself in the bathroom mirror and I looked like a zombie - the mascara smudged onto my lower eyelids. I wasn‚Äôt sweaty or particularly busy at my job. Cleaning up my messy smudged eyes was very difficult because this mascara is tenacious it may as we‚Äôll be waterproof. This was a waste.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

"interesting but didn‚Äôt love the look, returned it",glowingfairy,21 Nov 2022,"I think this is just popping up in your FYP because it‚Äôs different. I like the concept of making brown/green eyes pop by using the opposite color on the wheel to contrast and I tried it but it made my lashes look too thin and light. I missed the boldness of a brown or black mascara so I returned it. If they made it a darker maroon color and less shiny berry, I would try it again. Also, watch a tutorial on using the wand, you apply the flat side first then swipe thru, not like regular mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

New Favourite Mascara,KateP88,15 Nov 2022,"I have blue eyes and was looking for a brown mascara for a more natural look, i typically wear burts bees but thought id splurge abd try this one. i love it! it makes my eyes pop somehow even more than black mascara did, its long lasting, i havent noticed any flakes or smudging or anything. the brush is different but nothing insane and i find it applies well. only thing is i wish this was a bit cheaper (dont we all) but im happy with the quality and effect! if youre looking for a higher end brown mascara you wont go wrong with this one.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Could be great‚Ä¶.,trishamariecase,13 Nov 2022,"Beautiful formula, except for the transfer and raccoon eyes after a few hours. This mascara has the potential to be a five star mascara if they figure out the transfer/raccoon eye issues. It leaves my lashes so soft, separated, no clumps, no crunchy feeling whatsoever, but I don‚Äôt like have black under eyes by lunch time.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Wish it was more berry color,AnaPiranha7,12 Nov 2022,"There aren‚Äôt tons of options for gals who don‚Äôt want black mascara and I was excited to find this. I wish it was a bit more berry and less brown (when it‚Äôs on it just looks like dark brown but it is less intense than true black mascara which was the goal). Also it seems to smudge pretty easily - I have to be extra careful when I‚Äôm applying it and sometimes when I look in the mirror hours later I have little bits of mascara that have caked off my eye lids and are under my eyes (I‚Äôm pretty good about not touching my eyes during the day). After buying this I found a few companies that specialize in ginger mascara so I may look there next, but this does give the dramatic volume of a traditional mascara without the super dark intensity",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Falsie Effect but Learning Curve Required,Amil12,11 Nov 2022,"First off, I normally don't like this type of mascara wand because I need a full brush to get a nice coat of mascara on all of the lashes I have but there was a Reddit post that said this was the best mascara and a lot of people cosigned so I thought I'd try it out. The first time I wore this, I really didn't like it because I didn't know how to use the wand correctly. I noticed a flat side of the wand which I just couldn't figure out. I ended up with lashes that looked like I barely had mascara on. I decided to give it one more shot so the next day I applied the mascara and as I was applying it I realized the flat side should be used to load up the lashes with product. The wand definitely doesn't pick up enough mascara at once so I had to dip the wand back in multiple times to load my lashes up. Simply swipe the flat side from the base to the tip of the lashes. The flat side also helps to push the lashes upwards so be sure to gently push the lashes while applying. Then I used the comb side to separate my lashes. I ended up looking like I had on falsies. Definitely a pretty look, very natural lash extension vibes but I have to take off one star because of the amount of times I had to dip the wand in the bottle to get mascara out. The formula isn't too thick nor too runny and it's a good black but I feel it's not the blackest.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Basically worth the money,RonnieColombia,9 Nov 2022,"Now let me say, I love this Mascara. It coats my lashes and fans them beautifully. While the price has me hesitating on if its my ultimate favourite, let me say I wore this on a boat trip where I was soaked by salty air in the end, it didn't run smudge or dry up. I have also had an unfortunate incident where I got sprayed in the face with perfume (I'd really rather not explain that one) but again it did not move. You will like what you get but the price is high.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Just Ehh.,JLove13,5 Nov 2022,"For all the hype, I was excited to try this. I did a side-by-side comparison with my favorite mascara. I primed and curled my eyelashes first and wore it all day before I compared. When I applied it, both eyes looked the same. By the end of the day, 'maybe' this one looked better but I couldn't be sure no matter how long I stared. I shared the photos with a few who agreed there really seemed to be no difference. Sorry. I'll keep my less expensive mascara under those conditions all day every day. The wand did separate the lashes well. But they were absolutely no longer or more 'pushed up' or had more volume.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

A must have mascara,LissaG,11 Oct 2022,"After using this for a few weeks now, I love how my lashes look every single time I apply this mascara.  My lashes are long but thin and this applicator brush is awesome with lifting and not clumping but accentuating the length and thickening the lash just enough but without the messy clumping look.  I also love the way I can use the last for application of my lower lash line just perfectly.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Gorgeous for the first 30 seconds,ipomoea911,18 Sep 2022,"This looks amazing when it goes on, but within an hour, it‚Äôs all over under your eyes even if you sat perfectly still.

Lovely,pameladoucet98,13 Sep 2022,This mascara is perfection. It reminds me of a higher end ‚Äúl‚Äôoreal telescopic‚Äù. It never gets clumpy and can just get these long spread out beautiful natural lashes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointing :(,hunyfahami,11 Sep 2022,Omg! I‚Äôve never had a mascara run and smudge as much as this one did. The wand is ok but it didn‚Äôt curl my lashes as much either. All I can say is save your money and don‚Äôt buy this. I‚Äôve had  $3 mascaras work better!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
A rare miss from Charlotte,liliana1997,9 Sep 2022,This mascara looked gorgeous upon first application -- I was so disappointed when it transferred all over my under eyes after about half an hour of wear. I have normal to dry skin so oil wasn't even the issue -- I hope they reformulate because the brush works great and I loved the initial look of my lashes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

"Stunning color, be careful how you apply.",katswan,8 Sep 2022,"Okay so first off the color is stunning. I have blue eyes and it is seriously the most beautiful mascara I‚Äôve owned, I don‚Äôt ever want to go back to standard black mascara. I will say the first few applications were a little frustrating. I found it to be heavy and didn‚Äôt hold a curl at all, I wasn‚Äôt impressed. HOWEVER, I tinkered with it and found that if I start at the tips of my eyelashes and kind of work my way backwards to the base of my lashes, almost combing as I go, it applied beautifully. And holds a curl, separated, and doesn‚Äôt smudge. I love it now that I know how to apply it the right way for me, hoping the tube lasts a",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not for oily monolids like me.,sherrypeaches,6 Sep 2022,"Monolid girls, this is not for us. If ur lashes are constantly touching ur upper eyelid, this will smudge. And if you have oily lids like me, it‚Äôll extra smudge. But if you don‚Äôt suffer from any of 
the above and ur lashes don‚Äôt touch any of ur upper lid then you should be fine as this does lengthen beautifully!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Just‚Ä¶not good,kelppnoodle,3 Sep 2022,"Felt dry right out of the package, waxy feeling and did nothing for my lashes. I had higher hopes for this product and actively look for cruelty free products but this is not it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not what I thought,elenad8,30 Aug 2022,"It‚Äôs definitely not what I expected from a Tilbury product. Did nothing for my lashes, no volume or lift. I had to use two other mascaras in order to fix it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Wanted to love it,leahsusann,29 Aug 2022,I got the mini as a part of the VIB birthday gift. I was seriously so impressed with application and the initial look of this mascara. I also love the shape of the applicator too. However it transferred on both upper and lower lids within a couple hours.

"great mascara, terrible wand",deanto,29 Aug 2022,"I absolutely love the mascara itself because it makes my green eyes pop, but I‚Äôm taking points off because the wand is terrible so it‚Äôs hard to apply it evenly and without clumping. Beautiful colour, though!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudges even into my eyeballs,sw825,28 Aug 2022,"It‚Äôs really clumpy and wet on application. I got this as a mini sample for the bday gift, and‚Ä¶ I wish I hadn‚Äôt. I have decent lashes, and I could see how this could add volume and depth, but it‚Äôs so wet and clumpy from the tube. It was even smearing on my actual eyeball every time I blinked. Had to wipe it off and flush my eye out. Do NOT recommend.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Phenomenal!,jillyyybeans,27 Aug 2022,"Thickening, voluminous, lengthening, and inky, velvety black without stiffness! Checks all the boxes!

Love it but it dries too fast in the tube,Sunnylana,9 Aug 2022,I loved it the first time I got it but my last reorder started drying within weeks and it‚Äôs almost unusable now.

Meh,panute1983,22 Jul 2022,Meh. It's okay in terms of having a different shade but it was pretty hard to get off. I wish more companies had more colour options : (  This was more brown in person than the photos and the wand is annoying. (flat on half),Tilbury,Mascara,No

Crap,CAKBA,17 Jul 2022,One of the crappiest mascaras I‚Äôve ever used. Flakes off like CRAZY and doesn‚Äôt last all day. I asked Sephora worker for a mascara that wouldn‚Äôt run or flake on my face after a couple hours and this was exactly what I didn‚Äôt want. Don‚Äôt waste $35 on this.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
worst mascara,MacIsaac,17 Jul 2022,"Agree with other reviews - this is the worst mascara I‚Äôve ever bought! Hardly any product applied to my lashes even after three coats. The formula is super dry and the brush is terrible. If I could give it a 0, I would.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
my Favorite mascara,alexeva111,17 Jul 2022,"Brush took me a one year learning curve, but now that I‚Äôve gotten used to it I will never go back to anything else! Works for sensitive eyes, separated really well, volumizes‚Ä¶. This mascara is doppeeeee",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"fluffy, beautiful lashes. My new Holy Grail",CrazyRainbows,16 Jul 2022,"Formula is a little drier than I'm used to but it works really well with the brush here, and lets you get wonderful separation so my lashes look fluffy and natural. No clumping or spidering here! Color is unique and looks like a slightly berry toned brown on my light brown lashes but is still far more flattering than a black on my pale skin. 

longevity is excellent for me, I don't get any flaking or running with it even after an 8 hour shift sweating like crazy. For a non-waterproof formula that's really impressive. I have long lashes naturally so this makes them look even longer but not absurdly so.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Charbeauty76,16 Jul 2022,I‚Äôm 46 and tried many mascara‚Äôs on the market and I just tried this one yesterday as I got it for a birthday gift and I was so amazed!!

I went outside and was a bit sweaty but it didn‚Äôt move! Love this!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
really meh,softsagittarius,14 Jul 2022,"I had really high hopes for this mascara because I love CT!  However it fell really short.  Brush is pretty cool.  But the formula is really lackluster and smudges fast.  Also didn‚Äôt really do much for my lashes.  It is exactly a mascara.  If you boujee and for the money to burn, by all means buy it.  But if you‚Äôre on a budget, don‚Äôt take the plunge.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
(sorry for the jump scare),katherinekap,14 Jul 2022,"if you have brown lashes this mascara might not be noticeable in color as much, but mine are blonde on the tips so this works. also, this is probably the least clumpy mascara i‚Äôve ever used. 4 stars because the formula is a little dry.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Lengthening for SURE!,SallyGlam,11 Jul 2022,"Quite possibly the best mascara I've ever tried.  I'm confused by some of the reviews about the brush and having to watch videos on it? It's pretty simple and makes your lashes look like extensions.  I was shocked by the difference it was from other products like IT Cosmetics and other more expensive brands.  Everyone is different, but for me, this is hands-down my new go to mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
my dream mascara,mariami77,9 Jul 2022,This is exactly what I look for in a mascara. You have to apply it with the flat side first to get the volume and then with the bristles. It applies very evenly and not clumpy. It lengthens and has the perfect volume to separation ratio. It also is quite light on the lashes compared to other volumizing mascaras. It doesn‚Äôt flake for me or smudge and keeps my curl,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Do not buy,bayaffe,5 Jul 2022,Worst mascara I have ever bought. Does absolutely nothing for your lashes- no lift or volume whatsoever. Such a waste of money,Tilbury,Mascara,No

,Trixyt4,1 Jul 2022,"One of the worst mascaras I‚Äôve ever used. Very disappointing. It wears off on my eye lids and under my eyes. No, I‚Äôm not working out or in hot weather. Just everyday normal things and ever time it gets all over my skin. Definitely won‚Äôt buy again. Doesn‚Äôt do much to lengthen or add volume.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,SassyMel,28 Jun 2022,"Great volume. Love the colour for blonds & gingers - gives a great pay-off against my green eyes. I do find it flakes though - but I live in a hot & humid region so it can be tough on mascara. I HATE the brush and I think it doesn't do the formula justice. Overall, it's very good; not great. I'll use up the tube happily, but probably won't repurchase.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
use it the right way for magic to happen,brecahb123,27 Jun 2022,"For those of you who find this mascara ‚Äúblah‚Äù, you‚Äôre sadly mistaken.

terrible. do not buy.,heatherthompson,13 Jun 2022,This mascara is horrible. There is very little product in the tube and it is very dry.

Fantastic & Buildable,lexiblue101,2 Jun 2022,"Great product, very buildable without being clumpy, got this originally in travel size (came with a lip and eye CT gift set) and I fell in love with it and started using it more than my previous go to.  Only dislike is that the bristles for the wand aren't 360 so you have to make sure that you have it angled right, that said the way it's shaped and the way the bristles tapper off towards the type make it so easy to get the lashes towards the inner corner without getting mascara on your under eye and/or lid.  Personally I prefer the travel size after purchasing the full size, they size is great I just personally prefer the shorter wand.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,amyickk,2 Jun 2022,Not impressed. Have to apply so much and still looks/feels like there is nothing but I somehow get mascara smudges. Better off getting maybelliene,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Awful Brush,Sammy3629,1 Jun 2022,"I am so upset about this mascara. I love love love the berry color on the lashes. I think this color would look good on literally anyone but especially with brown or light brown eyes. 
What I hate is the brush. It is so easy to get the side that doesn‚Äôt have any bristles and put a whole glob of mascara on the lashes. It turns into a gooey mess with this. If you get it on the bristled side then it‚Äôs fine but you really have to calculate your mascara placements so it doesn‚Äôt get all over. It also smudges a bit but that‚Äôs the case for most regular non waterproof mascaras in my opinion.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
perfect buildable mascara.,rvshelbs,30 May 2022,"i wear mascara everyday to school and this one give the perfect length without having clumps after your 2 coat. it also doesn‚Äôt thin out your eyelashes either, which other mascaras have done to me. it also doesn‚Äôt smudge on my lashes. for those reviews that say that it does smudge, make sure your lashes are completely dry and you roll the brush onto your lashes, starting with the comb like part. love this mascara!!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Highly Disappointed,WickedVante,17 May 2022,"Honestly I am extremely disappointed in this mascara. 

I‚Äôve heard a lot of hype surrounding it and decided to take the plunge as I‚Äôm always looking for a new go to mascara (I‚Äôve mainly been using the badgal bang mascara from benefit and the REM flourishing length mascara). 

Considering this mascara is advertised as both volumizing and lengthening, I was hoping to merge the best of both worlds from the mascaras that I switch between on the daily. Not only was it clumpy straight out of the bottle, four coats later, it was still giving me zero length. It darkened my lashes and clumped them together quite a bit but that was about it. I can‚Äôt even say it did well for me on the volumizing side of things. I get far better results with 1-2 coats of the other mascaras I use. For a mascara at THIS specific price point, I should not have to apply 4 or more coats. 

Overall, I‚Äôm disappointed and if you already do not have nice long luscious lashes, this is 1000% NOT the mascara for you.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
length + lift + thickening,Teri75,14 May 2022,"I have long lashes that need lift. This mascara adds length, thickens, lifts and holds a beautiful curl. For anyone that misses the original Chanel Volume de Chanel, this is very similar. I left off one star for the applicator. I almost didn‚Äôt buy this. I‚Äôd watched several videos from CT‚Äôs Instagram and it looked way too thick and messy‚Äîvery much like those multi level marketing mascaras that give spider lashes. I am glad I took a chance. You have control over the product and as long as you don‚Äôt over layer and build it to the extreme it can look glam without crossing the line into something else.  I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it flaking or running. It‚Äôs been a good clean wear for me. I sent a tube to a close friend because I liked it that much.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not for me,alrd,13 May 2022,The color was interesting but it didn‚Äôt do anything for my eyes. The color wasn‚Äôt the reason I‚Äôm returning. The formula is terrible. Too much product comes out on the wand and lashes look clumpy.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Cute for all of 20 mins‚Ä¶,Paige441,10 May 2022,"Looks beautiful, dark and bold‚Ä¶for about 20 minutes. Then it smears and gives me under eye bags. No matter what I do, it manages to flake and smudge. Pass.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
worst mascara,ayaya6,10 May 2022,Never new a mascara could be so bad.  It smudges so badly under the eye and flakes a lot too.  It‚Äôs fine for separation and volume but there are thousands of better mascaras.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Exceeded every expectation!,lizziefoshizzle,10 May 2022,"Just WOW. I am a recent CT devotee despite hearing only good things about this brand for ages. I had read mixed reviews about this mascara but decided to finally give it a try ‚Äî so happy I did! I can‚Äôt believe how amazing my lashes looked after just one coat. Now, I did use a mascara primer first ‚Äî I ALWAYS do as I‚Äôve found it makes every mascara look better (and I‚Äôve tried them ALL) ‚Äî so maybe this amplified the results. But my lashes have never looked longer while also thick/voluminous yet separated!! Truly amazing. I love a silicone mascara brush, but this one is particularly long and skinny, which must work to coat each and every lash (even the shorter ones) with product. Again, I‚Äôve tried a LOT of mascaras and this one really is the best I‚Äôve ever tried. Luxury makeup price tag included ‚Äî go figure!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
meh,Marmalady,8 May 2022,"I am fortunate to have long eye lashes however they grow straight out like skewers. I want my mascara to add volume, lengthen, lift and separate and above anything else curl!

I have naturally long eyelashes and this wand makes them clump up, so much so that I end up looking like I have half the eyelashes that I actually do. I will give it another go, but I think it's a bit of a dud, unfortunately. Wish she'd change up the wand.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Worked okay but the color wasn't for me,shirlsmg,4 May 2022,"Pretty good for volume and length, but the color was more of a reddish brown than regular brown to me and I didn't really like how it looked on my eyelashes. I've tried better brown mascara. Returned this product.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,aelcott0,4 May 2022,"I LOVE IT!! it lengthens and volumizes. But there‚Äôs not a lot of curl, at least for me, so I recommend curling your lashes before. it doesn‚Äôt smudge!!!this is after 16+ hours of wear. the wand can sometimes pick up a lot of product so I recommend wiping some on the rim of the tube if needed. the color is to truly die for!!!!!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
don‚Äôt do it!,KeshaMalesha,3 May 2022,"I wear brown mascara on the reg when I‚Äôm going for a less dramatic look.  This one is noticeably lighter than a traditional brown mascara‚Ä¶to the point I had a couple gals ask me about the color with less than positive tones.  Turns out I don‚Äôt love the color, which is all well and good, I could pick a different color.  I do not like the formula at all.  The first time I applied it it went on beautifully making my lashes look longer and fuller - after that first time the product is just weird.  Combined with the weird brush, I end up with too much product on my lashes after just one coat and and there‚Äôs no fixing it.  The more I try to fix it, the worse it gets.  The flat side of the brush just globs on the product.  Don‚Äôt get me started on how poorly the formula performs ‚Ä¶ and since it‚Äôs a reddish base color, it looks like I‚Äôm having some sort of allergic reaction because the skin around my eyes is smeared with the reddish product.  All the way around this is a fail‚Ä¶I‚Äôll go back to what I was using before.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
love it!!!,nvlhes,3 May 2022,"I have tried a few mascaras but I end up giving up because they all are supper clumpy and leave me looking like a raccoon in an hour but this mascara is amazing!! I love it so much, it‚Äôs super lengthening and I will buy the full size once I‚Äôm done with this mini one.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,JessicaHbeauty,2 May 2022,ITs good for the first 2 weeks then dries out. Such a bummer,Tilbury,Mascara,No
One of the best !,joanne417,2 May 2022,One of the best mascaras I've tried.   The brush is key to this being so highly rated.  There are other nice formulas (Too Faced comes to mind) but I really dislike that type of applicator.   This formula leaves lashes soft to the touch (not stiff) and the brush gets every last lash.  Absolutely love it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love the color,Namra66,1 May 2022,LOVE this mascara! Lengthens and the color is so pretty. I recommend pairing this with the Lanc√¥me XL booster as a primer. It will make the mascara show its color even more.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,50andflirty,30 Apr 2022,Nice building mascara to create length and volume. A little clumping than I like,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Don't recommend,makeup9555,29 Apr 2022,If you love mascara that smudges then this is the one for you . . within 15 minutes I have black eyes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,smizz4,27 Apr 2022,"Hands down, the worst mascara brush I‚Äôve ever used. I‚Äôm honestly shocked there are so many positive reviews. The formula itself is fine, but the brush is terrible!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love the design of brush,cherryblossom67,27 Apr 2022,"For now I give five stars because , I never seen a brush  quite like this one.  I am sure that it will look very beautiful no matter what kind of lashes a person has",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,bmoney,26 Apr 2022,I absolutely love the way my lashes look with this mascara. I have pretty straight lashes and any mascara too heavy will weight them down and the curl won‚Äôt hold. This is such a lightweight formula and multiple coats feel like nothing. My lashes are holding that curl so strong right now. Forever love,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best mascara I‚Äôve ever purchased,minxiem,25 Apr 2022,"Application of this product is everything. Find out how to use on the CT insta or websites and you‚Äôll be amazed. Unique applicator, so much volume. 
Buy minis to save $ and product as you‚Äôll use it all by the time it‚Äôs time to toss them for safety. The smaller wand allows for better application too",Tilbury,Mascara,No
HOLY LASHES!,HeatherAnn34,21 Apr 2022,At first I HATED it!! Until I figured out how to use it! I'll let my pic do the review!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,smiley1979,21 Apr 2022,It definitely lifts and adds volume to my lashes but it smudges so bad. It looks like I‚Äôve been crying after only an hour of wearing it especially on my lower lashes!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dream Pop - Berry Brown *Chef Kiss*,Blackgingerr,20 Apr 2022,"Let me tell you. This is THEE BEST brown Mascara I have ever tried. I pair it with the Fenty Beauty Big Truffle eyeliner and when I say *Chefs Kiss* I mean it! I don‚Äôt have any issues with smudging, Clumping, or issues with it not coming off. 

Im real basic with my looks. Most of the time I put lotion on my face, then the eyeliner, brush my lashes and then apply the mascara. When I want to take it off I grab a non scented baby wipe and sprinkle some Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup on the wipe and Bam it‚Äôs gone! I have very sensitive skin so the baby wipe non-scented method works for me and doesn‚Äôt dry my skin out like other makeup wipes have in the past. 

Brown has been my go too mascara for a while now and I love it. I honestly don‚Äôt believe eye color matters but my eyes are dark brown if that helps anyone awesome! 
This is replacing my Clinique and They‚Äôre Real Benefit Brown Mascara so thank you",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Don‚Äôt do it,tanriver,18 Apr 2022,When I first applied it I loved it. It elongated and separated my lashes. The problem was that 30 min later it was bleed down my cheeks. I cleaned it up and an hour later I looked again like a panda. I liter‚Äôs threw it away. And I love CT but this mascara is a no no for me.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Racoon Eyes,ellie50,18 Apr 2022,"I'm glad I purchased the mini.  I didn't find the brush a challenge and I liked the way my lashes looked, but by 3 hours after application, I had racoon eyes. I didn't apply to lower lashes, it was just from blinking,  I have straight lashes that don't hold a curl well, so I look for both volumizing and lengthening.  The other positive was it's not too oily/waxy and doesn't slide into my eyes and leave a blur on my RGB contact lenses.  But, sadly. I won't repurchase.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
black is boring!,jdchambers98,18 Apr 2022,"I got this in dream pop because I love the pillow talk color lipstick. Y‚Äôall!! Black seems so boring now! My eyes are kinda green, kinda gray, and this makes them stand out so much more! It really lengthens.. and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever said that about a mascara. Doesn‚Äôt clump. It‚Äôs awesome! My lashes are normally a light brown color, so when I don‚Äôt wear mascara they just kind of go away..
This is an awesome color I think you should try it!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
LOVE!,Brittlillian,17 Apr 2022,Love this mascara! The colour is beautiful and really enhances my green eyes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
My new favorite mascara,Rachelm051t,15 Apr 2022,Ok y‚Äôall I know mascara is personal but just look at these lashes! I love the beautiful burgundy brown shade. It makes my blue green eyes pop. It is a wet formula and is not a mascara for beginners but I‚Äôm officially in love!!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
it‚Äôs a no for me.,melidaubcadena,15 Apr 2022,Transfers to the under eye. Very annoying. I like the wand though. Won‚Äôt buy again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,cutcreasehoe,14 Apr 2022,The brown looks the same as the black. I have blue eyes and thought this would make them pop. Couldn‚Äôt tell a difference from the black one lol.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,pistachiogirl,14 Apr 2022,"My fave mascara!  Separates lashes, no clumps and makes them look voluminous.  Will repurchase again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
WOW! Beautiful.,lvid,13 Apr 2022,I have never used a charlotte tilbury mascara until today.  I wanted to try this colour.  The brush takes a bit of getting used to but my reasonably long lashes look fantastic today.  The colour is beautiful and unassuming and the length that it provided is crazy.  I will purchase again.  No flaking and no transfer at this point.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Beautiful for blue eyes,XenonGalaxy,9 Apr 2022,"I like this mascara a lot, the colour Dream Pop is so pretty and it makes my blue eyes really pop! The only down side is that it flakes during the day, nothing too terrible but still had to take off 1 star.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
My new favorite mascara,Augusta1600,7 Apr 2022,"I bought the new Dream Pop shade from the Charlotte Tilbury site the first day it launched. I love the color most of all, but the formula is nice. I have sensitive eyes and this does not make my eyes hurt. It‚Äôs been really hot here and it hasn‚Äôt smudged once. The results are not dramatic though, it doesn‚Äôt look quite as pictured on the models. I like a more natural look for the daytime though so I didn‚Äôt deduct any stars.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great for sensitive eyes /migraine/headaches,SakuraChan7,7 Apr 2022,"I am in love with this mascara. Love the brush p.s you will have to get the hang of it you can go on youtube and watch on CT channel. I applied it around 9 am and it stayed put till 10pm. No clumping,no transferring to upper or lower lids, NO MIGRAINES it means this is formulated clean and no harsh chemicals... I have tried countless number of mascaras in my life time from drugstore to high end but nothing like Charlotte Tilbury push up lashed mascara. I used to get severe headaches the moment I use any mascara and I will have to use a makeup remover only to remove my mascara. There are days where I used to carry makeup removing wipes just to remove my mascara post an event or a conference. Non sponsored review. I am so thrilled to have found this mascara. I got this mascara during the Rouge Spring sale. I got 2 of them as I had high hopes and I don't know why no one suggested me this before. To give you a little background I am someone who wears minimal makeup, no heavy eyeshadow, only one and done eyeshadow wearer. I like to keep it minimal. No words can describe how thrilled I'm to have found this. CT never disappoints me, pls don't stop making this mascara ever.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great for natural looking lashes,Megsie1991,3 Apr 2022,"I love this mascara, however I wouldn‚Äôt consider it a full volume one. The wand is a bit different than what I normally go for with the bristles, but if your looking for something that gives a more natural mascara finish, this is great, and the packaging is really cute with the gold and pink. Wouldn‚Äôt call it long wearing but it‚Äôs a really nice mascara for when your looking for a more natural look.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,strawberrycakes,3 Apr 2022,"One of my favorite mascaras, this is my second repurchase",Tilbury,Mascara,No
one of my favorites,krissy316,29 Mar 2022,"This mascara is one of my favorites. It‚Äôs not a super dramatic effect but it works with a few coats. My lashes are lengthened, not clumpy, and I Wear it all day with no problems. I usually do set my under eyes with powder though.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,lilahlove,27 Mar 2022,"I‚Äôve heard this mascar requires some learning to get used to the wand. I get that. So I did not dock much off for that but the mascara smears on me and gives me raccoon eyes by the end of my shift. However I do not wear face makeup to work, only moisturizer, so maybe that‚Äôs why‚Ä¶ but not excited for it or the price",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Wouldn't Recommend,RuthShamma,27 Mar 2022,"It had a very dry consistency, with little product and pigment.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,JennaReeves,27 Mar 2022,Doesn‚Äôt really make your lashes look different. But it falls so much like by mid day I‚Äôve got raccoon eyes,Tilbury,Mascara,No
SUPER SMUDGING,bepamj,27 Mar 2022,"This was the smudgiest mascara I have ever used, and I've been using mascara for 50+ years.  Within the 45 minutes that I applied the mascara to the time I was ready to leave for work, it was already smudging.  Far too much time was devoted to cleaning this mascara from my under eyes.  I saw that one reviewer actually used this on her top lashes and a different mascara on her bottom lashes to try to prevent the smudging.  To me, that is unacceptable.  I gave it one star for the unique brush, which did a marvelous job of lifting and separating my lashes, and the second star for being a cruelty free company, which is very important to me.  I have already returned this mascara and went back to my ILIA Limitless Lash mascara.  It flakes a tiny bit, but no raccoon eyes!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,izcas,27 Mar 2022,"Wouldn‚Äôt repurchase. It definitely lengthens and gives volume that‚Äôs no worries, but the amount of flaking not only under the eyes but into the eyes as well is awful. Quite literally have to pull flakes out of my eyes because it‚Äôs irritating otherwise. Overall, save your money.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,TayJay13,26 Mar 2022,"I am OBSESSED. I‚Äôve tried dozens of mascaras and there‚Äôs always been something about one of them that hasn‚Äôt worked. I‚Äôm a personal trainer, very active, and mascaras always seem to flake on me- not this one. It separates, lengthens, curls (haven‚Äôt used an eyelash curler since purchasing), and doesn‚Äôt run or flake at all throughout the day. I‚Äôm legit obsessed, and everyone who has spoken to me in the past couple weeks knows it. BUY THIS, You won‚Äôt regret it!!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
It‚Äôs OK,kattko,26 Mar 2022,It‚Äôs ok. It didn‚Äôt hold my eyelashes up as I expected. I have long straight lashes and need something to hold them up.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
no thanks,MsBadBe,26 Mar 2022,"I grabbed this when I got the color pop pallet. The eye shadows are stunning this not so much. It smudged too easy, when fresh was impossible to curl it just was a mess. Didn‚Äôt give me much length or volume.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
like it but‚Ä¶,makeupmare,26 Mar 2022,I want to love this but I have hooded eyes and it ends up on my lids. It‚Äôs glossy and black  but I can‚Äôt have it on my lids.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dark under eyes after 3 hours.,lilgingerwasabi,21 Mar 2022,"I wanted to love this. When I initially put this on in the morning, it looked fine. But after about 3 hours, I have raccoon eyes. By the end of the day, there's no mascara left on my eyelashes. Would not buy it again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
not the best,taif44,21 Mar 2022,Just added to my lashs lengh without any volume stay all day fourmal is pretty good well not buy the full size,Tilbury,Mascara,No
I loved it! At first..,N1c0le,17 Mar 2022,"Straight out of the tube, I loved this mascara. There was a slight learning curve with the brush as it's not your typical shape. This did everything for me. Great separation, volume, and most importantly, no flaking or smudging. I have sensitive eyes, so they water easily. At about the 3 month mark, I noticed a change (which is to be expected). Sadly, I like it less now. It doesn't lift, separate, and hold curl the way it used to. This has become mediocre at best. Sadly, this will not be a re purchase for me.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Flake City,Brittanygaudio,16 Mar 2022,Flake city girl. Flake city. Oh my god my under eyes were covered in black after an hour of wear. I was so excited it looked really good but the under eyes are horrible,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Very Dry Formula,danilona,13 Mar 2022,"I usually LOVE Charlotte Tilburty products. Sadly, this was my first and so far only CT product I did not like. The brush was exquisite, there was no funny mascara smell and the color was great. However, the product was very dry. I usually prefer dryer formulated mascaras but this one almost didn‚Äôt even apply. I wore it for a few hours and it ended up running all over my face‚Ä¶ Very strange.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,jenco,11 Mar 2022,"I‚Äôm not sure why people aren‚Äôt talking about this mascara! In one coat it lengthened & separated my lashes. One coat & my lashes look incredible 10/10 I‚Äôve tried a lot of mascaras & this is my new favorite!! Wish I

very dry,puzia,4 Mar 2022,"When I first used it, I thought that I got an opened one, but that‚Äôs just the formula - it‚Äôs so dry you can barely use it. After a month of using it I feel like nothing goes on my lashes anymore. I‚Äôm giving it 2 stars just because the wand does a very good job separating the lashes and it didn‚Äôt irritate my eyes, but that is all I can say in a positive tone. Def not worth the price tag.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,arianawy,4 Mar 2022,"It‚Äôs a shame this mascara leaves you with such raccoon eyes after a Few hours of wear because it truly does separate and lengthen without clumps. the formula simply smudges so badly under your eyes it‚Äôs not worth the purchase .

Raccoon eyes like it‚Äôs 1995,ambermh,1 Mar 2022,I‚Äôm shocked at the positive reviews for this product. I have pretty good luck with mascara. This one took me back to high school.  I had black lines on my browbone and raccoon eyes underneath. I though makeup formulators had solved that problem by now. In the trash it goes :(,Tilbury,Mascara,No
raccoon eyes,navywendy0p,1 Mar 2022,Absolute garbage product. Literally sat all night playing cards and it looked like I had been crying all night from the transfer in my lower lids. If I could give it a zero I would. This is probably the WORST mascara I‚Äôve ever used,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Product transfers pretty bad,Mizzrica56,28 Feb 2022,Product is beautiful. I love the wand. However the formula is terrible. It transfers so fast no matter how well I prep my lids.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,et2008,26 Feb 2022,"Wow, just wow. Full disclosure I have very long lashes due to growth serum, and finding a mascara that doesn't clump or get lost in them is very difficult.

,zmary,26 Feb 2022,Perfect. I‚Äôve tried so many different mascaras and this one is the best. Thrive used to be my favorite. Now it‚Äôs this one. It takes a few coats but it works great.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

"Great, but not for bottom lashes",mandkittykateer,19 Feb 2022,Really love how this makes my lashes look light and fluffy. I don‚Äôt like mascara that makes the lashes look clumpy and like spider webs. This doesn‚Äôt do that whatsoever and I love it! I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars because it did not work well on my bottom lashes. I have to use another mascara for my bottoms because this one will smudge and have the raccoon eye look.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Waste of money,deidree,18 Feb 2022,I wanted to love this mascara but unfortunately it is so dry in the packaging that nothing but one clump comes out. I requested a reshipment but the replacement was just as bad. What a waste of money. Wish I could give it 0 stars.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Who knew mascara application required lessons?,Hnpurcell,17 Feb 2022,"I have a love/hate with this mascara. I Love how it completely coats the base of my lashes and when done right I don‚Äôt even need to use eyeliner. I have really light eyelashes so that part is great. 
The problem lies with ease of application. I have never owned mascara that seemed so difficult to put on prior to this mascara. I had to practice! You shouldn‚Äôt have to get lessons on how to put some mascara on but that was the case with this stuff‚Ä¶. I legit YouTubed it. 

The consistency is thick and it tends to bulk up on the flat part of the brush and can create clumps on your lashes if you don‚Äôt quickly pull the wand to the ends of your lash. I also have to have qtips handy because I always get the mascara on my lid. It‚Äôs quite a production.
 
I debated back and forth on returning this mascara because it was expensive and tacks on unnecessary time to what used to be seamless makeup application. But my lashes look sooooo good when I don‚Äôt rush it. Probably won‚Äôt buy it again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudges off in 30 minutes,DollFaceGirl,16 Feb 2022,"I wear a full face of Charlotte Tilbury on a daily basis, that is, except for mascara. I received a mini from the Charlotte Tilbury website directly as a free bonus item with my purchase. It smudges off below my lower lashes within 30 minutes no matter what I do. I've tried skipping concealer and adding powder to try and reduce moisture. I think it is the humid climate I live in, but either way, I will be skipping this mascara in the future.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not Great,sarahbera,16 Feb 2022,"Not Great, it constantly smudges and my lashes look depressed",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not worth it!,Sosofly,15 Feb 2022,"I was extremely disappointed with this mascara. I don‚Äôt know if I got a bad one but after one application, the product dry so fast I don‚Äôt have time to play with it. And when I try to add more it‚Äôs all chunky and dry.

Runs easily,Annika86,4 Feb 2022,"This mascara is beautiful when you first out it own. It feels luxurious at first and does open up the eyes. However, it runs very easily.

exactly as advertised,EllyKat,3 Feb 2022,"This is the first luxury mascara I‚Äôve ever purchased. I have pretty long lashes naturally so never needed to splurge to enhance them, but I vowed moving into my 30s I‚Äôd only buy high quality cruelty free items for my hair and skin. Especially mascara since that is pretty much all I wear. Let me tell you, I‚Äôm sold. With only one coat my lashes are full and defined. I was a little eh over the bristles not running entirely around the brush, but the performance of the mascara makes that a small nuisance in an overall amazing product. My lashes, again with only one coat, are fluffy, defined, not clumpy, and not flaky. New must have for me.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
yes! finally something for me !,mclarissa,29 Jan 2022,I love this mascara ! I‚Äôm usually not a mascara person like I don‚Äôt care for mascara because I have straight little short eyelashes.

Beautiful mascara that doesn‚Äôt flake,marisamoo,28 Jan 2022,"This mascara works really well for me, I can say it does not flake on me!

won‚Äôt buy again,Kristaleelogue,28 Jan 2022,I wish I would have checked out this brush before I bought it in store. If I would have known it was like that I wouldn‚Äôt have bought it. My lashes are thin and short and this didn‚Äôt help them look better at all. There is a flat side to the brush and it just takes getting used to knowing what side to use but I know I won‚Äôt purchase this again. It didn‚Äôt volumize but I got a little length out of it after a few coats.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
no thanks,ashaesco19,27 Jan 2022,"Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again. My mascara tends to sweat and I was excited to see what the hype was about.

I found myself constantly rubbing it off, in turn ruining the rest of my makeup.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Meh,Taya07,24 Jan 2022,It looks really good when first put on but throughout my day at school it just wears off until you can‚Äôt even tell I‚Äôm wearing mascara anymore. I recommend but I would put a primer before putting it on for all-day wear.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Wycheway,23 Jan 2022,"4 stars out of 5 because of the price. I feel I get more product with my previous fav: Dior Overcurl.

I also have very sensitive eyes and can't use some mascaras but no problem with this one.  If you can master using the flat side of the brush to apply the product it is phenomenol.

Messy formula,claiborneb,17 Jan 2022,"The brush has an effective shape, and my lashes look good but‚Ä¶ The actual formula of the mascara is really goopy? If you have hooded eyes don‚Äôt get this.

Nice mascara,jesien75,17 Jan 2022,"I have pillow talk and the legendary lashes vol 2. I like the brush and my lashes do look good. Not as dramatic as legendary but fuller than my natural mascara.

Subpar Mascara at a High Price,gloomboys,9 Jan 2022,"This mascara is really hard to use, and it only looks okay once you get it right. There‚Äôs two completely flat sides on the wand, but the other two sides have short bristles. There just aren‚Äôt enough bristles on the wand to provide good volume or separation between lashes. The formula also runs once it‚Äôs on your lashes. Overall too expensive to behave so poorly.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,kellloggggs,8 Jan 2022,This mascara is horrible. The wand is flat on one side which transfers way too much product on eyelashes and looks so clumpy. I love everything Charlotte tilbury but this ain‚Äôt it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Worst mascara,leonie1125,7 Jan 2022,"It gave me no volume, was very sticky and dry. I can get much better results with drugstores mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
raccoon eyes,trishamariecase,5 Jan 2022,I want to love this mascara because my lashes look pretty but it isn‚Äôt worth the transfer and the raccoon eyes after five hours. The legendary lashes volume 2 doesn‚Äôt do this so I will stick with that formula.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,bareesgirl,4 Jan 2022,"It‚Äôs interesting that so many have said they have bought it and it‚Äôs been dried out, that‚Äôs a bummer! So I ended up buying it, returning then buying again because I realized I wasn‚Äôt using it properly! The first time I didn‚Äôt like how it looked because I didn‚Äôt employ the proper technique. Now, I use the flat side of the brush first and and then the other side of the brush while curving my wrist up while applying and it looks super incredible - while lengthening and giving me amazing volume! So glad I decided to give it another chance! I‚Äôve tried many mascaras out there (always willing to give new ones a go) and glad I went back because I definitely see the difference now! Phenomenal product!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,cpach81,1 Jan 2022,I wanted to love this but I just didn‚Äôt. It looks great when first applied but smudged and flaked throughout the day. Will not be buying this again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Worst Goopy Mascara Ever,Wendyrite12,31 Dec 2021,Was honestly the worst mascara I‚Äôve ever tried. Was like sticky black goo. I couldn‚Äôt even really put it on my lashes and it came out in black chunks and was brand new coming with a pencil. I don‚Äôt know how anyone wears this. What a waste of $30,Tilbury,Mascara,No
love this mascara !,jennypenny39,31 Dec 2021,"Purchase it on an impulse buy waiting on line at Sephora and I‚Äôm obsessed pushes up and holds lashes , great pigment and doesn‚Äôt clump.  Will definitely be purchasing and full size tube !",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Pretty but not worth it‚Ä¶,samyorke,26 Dec 2021,"I bought one, opened it when I got home and it was completely dry. I exchanged it for a new one, and it was pretty, but it barely lasted 2 weeks. It‚Äôs not worth the money, there are so many better quality mascaras out there.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not Recommended,beach310,26 Dec 2021,"Bought this while waiting in line along with Climax by Nars mascara trial size. This mascara was sooooo disappointing. Not enough product, I think my bottle was empty? I was stuck with this mascara while I was on a trip with no time to shop for another mascara. This product sucked so much :( I put the brush against my eyelashes 100 times and nothing. No Product on my lashes visible nor did it make them ""Volumizing."" I have decently long lashes and this mascara is not helping them and absolutely not lengthening. My lashes looked very sad and the brush seemed useless. 

I did try the climax another time and WOW. HUGE DIFFERENCE compared to this product. I love this mascara way better.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
10/10,FingerBangz,26 Dec 2021,"I am a big fan of this stuff. It‚Äôs the only mascara I‚Äôve found thus far that hasn‚Äôt clumped up my eyelashes. Personally, I don‚Äôt like the thick clumpy look so this is perfect. It coats my lashes evenly, holds a curl, doesn‚Äôt smudge underneath, and is basically my lashes but better. Will be purchasing again as I use it everyday. (:",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Only non-waterproof formula that holds curls,wickedcoolmama,23 Dec 2021,"I have stick straight, heavy asian lashes that hangs downward and only waterproof formulas would hold the curl and I have tried almost all the mascaras from the major brands and nothing worked well in terms of keeping my curl up. This is the only non-waterproof formula that actually holds my curl and I am so happy to have tried the sample and I love how this mascara makes my lashes look. Fluffy, yet not clumpy, light-weight.

frozen/dry when delivered :(,ilianavlachos,23 Dec 2021,i ordered this because i saw someone on tik tok recommending it. i completely forgot that it‚Äôs cold outside and deliveries go through many stages. i received this and it was frozen and now i‚Äôm trying to unfreeze it. can someone please help me out? i tried it on though while it‚Äôs still thick and it‚Äôs not bad it felt super heavy on my eyelashes because of it being in the cold. it made the length of my eyelashes nice but clumpy because of how thick it is from freezing!!! but i recommend getting this in the spring/summer or buying it at your nearest sephora store. 30 dollars kinda went down the drain.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
empty tube?!,tripleosauce,22 Dec 2021,"Very disappointed.  The tube literally has no mascara in it.  I bought it yesterday, went to use it just now and the brush is dry and bent? Literally NO product whatsoever.  I'm sure this is just a defective tube, but it makes me question the quality control overall...",Tilbury,Mascara,No
waste of money,huerto,20 Dec 2021,"A staff member in store recommended this to be a super light but lengthening mascara....NOPE. Maybe if you already had long lashes, but for those of us not blessed with long lashes...do not get this! Waste of money!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
ehh,Mrshag,17 Dec 2021,"So I had high hopes for this mascara, I will say it does lengthen after you spend forever adding coats. The brush is weird too, it has a space in the middle. It's just a really different brush to get used to.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,AnneALEECE,13 Dec 2021,Pretty disappointed with this. It had big promises and didn‚Äôt do much for me. Took numerous applications to see a real difference.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing,ashley729,10 Dec 2021,I‚Äôve tried so many different mascara from so many company‚Äôs you name it and I most likely tried it .None of them have wow me like this mascara it actually makes me look like I have falsies and love how separated they look,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,sstephh,8 Dec 2021,"This mascara seems good for volume and also lengthening. Haven't had an issue with smudging or flakes. The only thing I'm confused about is the design of the wand. There's two flat sides of the brush that don't have any bristles at all, rendering them effectively useless. The flat sides do nothing but accumulate product, meaning some mascara will obviously end up going to waste. Can't understand the logic to it. Why not put bristles all over the mascara brush?",Tilbury,Mascara,No
does not smudge!!!,reiner,5 Dec 2021,"This product does NOT budge!! I went through a physiotherapy session, face down in the cradle and there was not one flake on my face after. I was shocked!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
no??,relativefemale,4 Dec 2021,"This product doesn‚Äôt withstand heat well. For me, being around small amounts of moisture made this mascara smudgy to the extent someone was like ‚Äùyo your mascara is like all around your eyes‚Äù so, for 29 bucks without tax, please try the mini before. Formulas work differently in different people, but I literally could never bring myself to write five stars ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE. it isn‚Äôt separating or lengthening. It literally is a no",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointed :(,madimac27,4 Dec 2021,"I got this mascara in the Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Mascara & Eyeliner Beautifying Eye Filter Set. I was really looking forward to this mascara but unfortunately, I was incredibly dissapointed. Application was ok but I didn't find that it lengthened my lashes at all. Over 20 minutes it weighed down my lashes and made them look quite bad and over 2-3 hours of wear it got very flaky and slightly smudged. I do not recommend this product, try the Hourglass Unlocked Instant Extensions Mascara for lengthening instead!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
good mascara,taylormsmith,4 Dec 2021,"I liked this mascara, nothing amazing or crazy about it, just a good mascara. I have long eyelashes naturally so I was more looking for volume, it worked nice! Make sure to read the instructions for proper use as the want is a bit different than a regular mascara wand. One side of the wand is to add the mascara and the other to disperse.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Most disappointing CT product,IwonaJ,1 Dec 2021,"As a lover of all Charlotte Tilbury products I was super excited to give this mascara a try. So much so that I purchased the full sized one right off the bat. BIG MISTAKE. I put it on in the morning and by noon I looked like a raccoon‚Ä¶and not the cute kind! I‚Äôve never had a mascara smudge so badly‚Ä¶.in fact I‚Äôve never had this issue with any mascara, even drugstore ones. SAVE YOUR COINS!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
looks like lash extensions!!!,Bella1183,29 Nov 2021,I received this as a freebie and I‚Äôm IMPRESSED. I‚Äôm a lash artist and this mascara looks like I have lash extensions!!! Absolutely amazing. I had an Est√©e Lauder mascara and really did like it UNTIL NOW. Buy this mascara.  You won‚Äôt regret it!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
I think it‚Äôs amazing,missjenni,26 Nov 2021,"I honestly think this mascara is amazing. Some people may not be applying it right and maybe that‚Äôs why there are so many negative reviews. The way I use it is by first applying it and letting It air dry a bit or use a fan for like 15 seconds so it‚Äôs not so wet when I reapply. I keep doing this until achieve the look I want. This product does not give me spidery lashes at all. They‚Äôre nice and full with my method and I have tried a lot of mascaras. I have never had flaking and it stays the same way I first applied all day/night. This isn‚Äôt a magical mascara, but it‚Äôs definitely one I am so happy I found and will continue to use.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

CLUMPY BUT WORKS,nyfashionista,22 Nov 2021,"First, yes, it‚Äôs clumpy. However, if you can scrape off excess on the bottle and work lightly and build up, you will notice how amazing this mascara is. It literally gives you falsies. Because you have to be careful, it takes longer to apply than a normal mascara. You may also need to carefully clear up excess on your lids afterwards. Everything considered, it‚Äôs a solid 4 stars.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Just buy something else,wanderermama,19 Nov 2021,"I really wanted to like this. I‚Äôve heard so much hype about Charlotte tilbury makeup. But this mascara is underwhelming with how it makes my lashes look. It smudges under my eyes so easily. And the applicator brush is problematic. I kept getting mascara on my lid right about my lashes. I never had that problem. I‚Äôve also been using this for a few months now, when I buy something I use it up, and recently shortly after I apply it my eyes are irritated. They water which makes the smudging worse. So now I can‚Äôt just use up this mascara, I have to buy a different one.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Virtually Instant Raccoon Eyes,curleyjoe,18 Nov 2021,"The mascara itself does a decent job. I found the brush to be a little sharp, but it went on well-enough. However, within one hour I had the most amazing raccoon eyes! Absolutely did not stay where it belonged.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,bellastella26,17 Nov 2021,"I first received this as a gift with purchase directly from Charlotte Tilbury. It was hands down the best mascara I have ever used.

1st time I liked a mascara,eble,13 Nov 2021,I got this as a sample (a really good sized sample!) with my last Sephora order and holy I LOVE IT.  Honestly have never been into wearing mascara I hate how it makes me look.  I have decent lashes.  They don‚Äôt stand out or anything but they create a nice natural outline of my eye and anytime I‚Äôve added mascara I think I look scary and wrinkly but I gave this a try and I almost died i finally feel what it‚Äôs like to feel like when your lashes get that pow.  Lifelong accomplishment here. I love that it thickens my eyelashes v naturally and I don‚Äôt have to draw them out long to make an impact.  It‚Äôs so perfect I‚Äôm really excited about this.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Oops Smokey Eye,Jules954,11 Nov 2021,"Lengthens as promised. Looks beautiful on at first, but transfers badly. Ended up with unintentional Smokey Eyes. Love CT products but this mascara could use some improvement.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
too smudgey,mollydmua,9 Nov 2021,"This product really transfers to my under eyes giving a really dark and smudged look. Which is unfortunate because I actually love the way it makes my lashes look. The wand is very unique, it has a flat side where there is a lot of product that you can use to saturate your lashes and then use the comb side to run the mascara through your lashes. It really volumizes and lengthens the lashes, I especially love it for the bottom lashes but I cannot get over the transferring unfortunately. I even tried applying a waterproof mascara over top and it just became too clumpy.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

1st CT Product That Disappoints,BSytes,9 Nov 2021,"The full size version of this product runs really badly.

I gave it 2 stars cause I do like the sample size version. Otherwise, 1 Star.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Vangirl18,8 Nov 2021,I was excited when I got this but quickly realized that it‚Äôs not worth the hype. It is very dry going on and initially it did flatter my lashes.

Just what I was looking for!,PollyAnna9,8 Nov 2021,This was exactly what I needed. I am 48 years old and some mascaras clump and look overdone when I use them.

Love it. Hate it.,birdie59,2 Nov 2021,Bought the mini to try this mascara. My lashes stayed curled for 14 hours; which I loved. It took 3 coats to get the effects I wanted. Those went on easily. However the mascara flaked off and smudged throughout the day. Tried again the next day with just one coat because that was all that I could get out of the tube. Still had flakes and smudges under my eyes. Set under eyes with finishing powder both days. For $13.00 I expected to get more than 2 applications. Agree with others that this mascara isn‚Äôt worth the money.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,annec83,28 Oct 2021,I absolutely loved it when I tried the sample size but I‚Äôm actually wondering if it is a completely different product. It clumps and smudges easily and makes my lashes look like spider legs. No lengthening or volumizing effects. Definitely not worth the money - to the point that I can name a handful of drugstore brands that are better. Quite out of character for Charlotte Tilbury products,Tilbury,Mascara,No
You won't ever want or need another mascara!,TammyRPG,24 Oct 2021,"This is hands down THE BEST mascara I have ever used. Everything about it is perfect. No clumps, clean application; the brush separates the lashes wonderfully, and the results?? Holy cow my lashes are BANGIN'! Like literally looks almost like I've put falsies on.  It's so buildable - you can just keep applying to make your lashes as lush as you want; and again, without clumps!  Amazing product!  The bonus is that it is easy to clean off too.  I will never use another mascara ever. This is THE ONE.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Eva1K,18 Oct 2021,"HORRIBLE. I was so excited to try this out. But, this mascara ended up smudging so easily even if I would lightly touch my eye. The mascara would be on my finger. It honestly seems like when you use the Brussel part of it no mascara is even on it. I had to do a few layers and even then I wasn‚Äôt happy. I definitely WONT be buying this again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"nope, not for me.",lcorput,18 Oct 2021,I don‚Äôt get the hype over this mascara. It did nothing but make my lashes super spidery looking with zero volume and zero length. I‚Äôve never really had any issues with mascaras transferring to my lower lash line but this made me look like a raccoon in a few hours flat. Sooooo disappointed with this one after it was raved about by a friend. What a flop.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

I have a $15 mascara that looks and preforms better.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

,arynicole,12 Oct 2021,My new favorite mascara! I got the mini size just in case I didn‚Äôt like it but I will definitely be ordering the larger size. The flat side makes it so easy to apply and then get on evenly. Only thing I would change is having an option in brown; the reason for only 4 stars. It really does Give my lashes volume and keeps them separated so they don‚Äôt get clumpy. It also does not flake off during the day.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
save your money,ViolaKay,9 Oct 2021,"Very disappointed with this mascara , its not worth the price tag, it‚Äôs smudges very easily,hard to apply without clumping",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"lengthened, lifted, and so pretty!",amygirl3540,8 Oct 2021,"I was not expecting to like this mascara very much, but I do like it! The brush is unique and helps to distribute the mascara well. My lashes definitely appear black, long, separated, and lifted. There is an adequate amount of volume, but not loads. I appreciate the non-clumpy formula and application so the minimal volume is fine. I also feel like the lengthening, separating, and lifting is so nice, that I‚Äôm not mad about it. It is volumizing, just not what I think most people expect. However, I find so many that create volume end up clumpy, so. Anyway, I like the formula. It is creamy, but not too wet and not dry. It doesn‚Äôt flake. I get a tiny bit of transfer onto my upper eyelids when I am wearing a mask, but that happens with so many. If I am not wearing a mask, it‚Äôs perfect. I like that my lashes remain soft. They feel healthy and conditioned. Again, maybe I had low expectations, but I will enjoy this and repurchase! This was gifted with no requirement to review here.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Worst mascara I have ever bought,Brin34,7 Oct 2021,This is by far the worst mascara I have ever used. Super clumpy and smudges. Drug store mascara is better than this. I never write reviews but I have to for this one because it was a huge waste of money.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,bellacapri,4 Oct 2021,"I didn‚Äôt expect to love this as much as I do! It‚Äôs super black, defines and lengthens lashes nicely, and doesn‚Äôt smudge or flake.

"Beautiful, long, feathery lashes",jkw4,28 Sep 2021,"I keep coming back to this mascara.  It makes my lashes so full, long and feathery, and it separates every lash.  I have shorter, fine eyelashes and this does voluminize mine, but if you want super duper voluminized lashes, this probably isn't for you. But I hate clumpy mascara and clumped up lashes, and this is none of those things, which is why I love it.  I don't understand the reviews complaining of clumping because I've never had that issue.  But I do make sure to use the narrow edge for maximum separation.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

"Gives lovely, natural looking lashes - but smudges",emilykourlas,31 Aug 2021,"Got the mini as a gift. This is the most natural mascara I have ever worn that lifts and lengthens my eyelashes (after curling them). I am stunned with how they look, it looks like my eyelashes but better. You can barely tell I have mascara on immediately after applying, just that I have perfect, long natural lashes. I also love the wand. However, the smudging is just AWFUL. An hour later there is a ton of smudging underneath my eye, and I have never applied this on my lower lashes. It would be worth the money if this if it weren't for the smudging. So sad, because I thought I found the perfect mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Best Separating Mascara Ever,1RedHeadedGal,23 Aug 2021,Best mascara to separate your lashes. I bought this in the mini and the Sephora gray tube with the green lettering to help thicken. This particular mascara makes my lashes separate so that it looks more like I'm wearing fake lashes without actually wearing them. Then when I put the Sephora coat on top it thickens and makes them bigger. Totally worth the money never had a mascara ever separate my lashes like this in my life. Just buy it and try it. If you're expecting something to make them look like va va voom this is not for you unless you're separating with the intent of throwing on something thicker. But it does separate your lashes exceptionally well.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Don‚Äôt buy,Chaparra2021,22 Aug 2021,"Waste of money.  Dry, nothing as described.  Bought online, never again!  Hopefully I can return.  For the price, not worth it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointed,AL0U,17 Aug 2021,I got a trial size and loved it. Bought a full size and have not been pleased with it at all. I feel as if it's dried out. Takes me forever to get enough mascara on. Too bad. Wish it was as good as the trial one.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Perfect lower lash definition!,carline,15 Aug 2021,"I received this as a sample with purchase. I cannot say this is better overall than TF Better Than Sex mascara but it does give all day lift to my lashes and is so good for lower lash definition.  Very black, didn't smudge or flake either.  I am a lash fanatic so doing upper lashes with BTS for volume followed by this CT mascara for lift and then only this CT on my lower lashes yields results I love.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Give it a shot!,Shapoopy,15 Aug 2021,"I‚Äôm really liking this mascara, I‚Äôve tried quite a few and the wand on this is a game changer! Swipe and rotate through and voila!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,honeybones,15 Aug 2021,reaaally pretty packaging and i love charlotte but it was too smudgy and made my lashes flat :/ the formula was smooth and didn‚Äôt clump but the ILIA mascaras are far more worth your money,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Mal84,15 Aug 2021,Enjoy this mascara but I find it clumps easily. But I do still love it and use it every day.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,MonishaM,13 Aug 2021,Bought this product from their official website. This product does not gives you as much volume as it says. There are other products that does a better job for less price. I also noticed this product smears after a while. Leaves you looking like a raccoon. For some reason it crumbles.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
nah,meggy75,12 Aug 2021,I‚Äôm mixed on this. It lengthens pretty well but doesn‚Äôt really thicken my lashes and it didn‚Äôt really seem to last long. I would not but again,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great mascara,Mimiromero,7 Aug 2021,"I really enjoy this mascara. It gives my lashes great lenght and does a great job at separating them and it does not clump. However i dont feel that this mascara gives my lashes volume, but it does give them great lengh. Also i really like the brush, it makes the application process super easy.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Eh,Meganmlr,4 Aug 2021,"I wanted to love this mascara and had high expectations but it missed the mark for me, personally. Everyone is different when it comes to mascara brush preferences but the brush itself and the thickness of the mascara itself just clumped on my lashes and looked down right BAD. Not for me :(",Tilbury,Mascara,No

the best mascara i‚Äôve tried:),saraiorfidaa,27 Jul 2021,"honestly the best mascara i‚Äôve used. i‚Äôve been using mascara since grade 5 and have gone the so many. this is definitely the best one i‚Äôve used so far. the least amount of fallout ever in a non waterproof mascara and it makes my lashes so long, voluminous and lifted.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Horrible,vmegan22,26 Jul 2021,"No lift, you can barely tell I had used it. It felt like o was using a really old mascara but I had just taken it out of the package.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,ZeldaDeku,24 Jul 2021,Me and the negative reviews must have used a different mascara. I received a sample and I absolutely love it. This mascara lengthens and separates your lashes beautifully. The brush allows you to built the product at the base of your lashes using the flat edges then using the combed edges you can drag the product through. This leaves you with beautiful dimension without looking clumpy. No  flakes no smears. Looked the same all day. Thank you CT.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Was asked if I got eyelash extensions!,ChrissiJean,19 Jul 2021,"My brow client asked me if I got eyelash extensions!   Best mascara I‚Äôve ever used!  And after working today, I worked 4 hours cleaning in the heat sweating to death and my lashes still look great.  Pics where taken after 4 hours working in the heat, mascara was applied 9-10 hours ago,  
I‚Äôll never buy a different mascara, best ever",Tilbury,Mascara,No
boring,pamglam60,19 Jul 2021,Nothing special at all about this mascara. Just the ordinary mascara. I do not recommend less I will never buy it again just waste money.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Stick to the CT lip products instead,dani0006,17 Jul 2021,I did not like this mascara at all :( I don‚Äôt think it lengthened or volumized at all. I wonder if I got a dud? Definitely wouldn‚Äôt buy again,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best BEST mascara I‚Äôve ever used,Airik,14 Jul 2021,"I have never loved a mascara this much and typically find one I like and once it‚Äôs done try something new. This is my 4th purchase and I hope I never have to use anything else. It doesn‚Äôt go on clumpy, stays put all day and the best part is that it gently lifts my sad little lashes, giving them the appearance that they are long and full. I can instantly see the difference between my eyes once I‚Äôve applied to the first one..It‚Äôs like a tint and lift every morning! You will not be disappointed with this purchase.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Clumpy, globby, makes lashes stick together: awful",lintqueen,13 Jul 2021,"Perhaps I got a dud? This is the worst mascara I've ever used, bar none. Even pulling the brush out of the tube, there's such an incredible ""goopy"" mascara build-up that I almost have to use a spoolie to remove enough that I don't give myself a black eye. On application, this works beautifully -- if what you're looking for is clumpy, stuck-together lashes with gobbets of mascara. Ick.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
This stuff is awesome!,wolfworx,12 Jul 2021,"I usually don‚Äôt write reviews, but THIS IS THE BEST MASCARA! Doesn‚Äôt flake, easy to remove but stays on even when you sweat, and the applicator deserves 6 stars. My new ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù mascara! I tried a sample first, then ordered the full size.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great for length and separation.,Kathareen,10 Jul 2021,"This has become a new favorite of mine. It‚Äôs great for those who are looking for a long fanned out lash with good separation. If you want volume, then I suggest either layering on a volumizing mascara over this one, or just buying a different mascara all together. I prefer to layer, because I like a waterproof mascara to seal my lashes. But that might be too high maintenance for some. If you‚Äôre looking for a more natural look with some length and darkening then this is a winner.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,centralperked,8 Jul 2021,"Requires some trial and error. At it's best, this gives a beautiful fanned out lash look. Is super easy to go too far with though. One swipe too many and it's a clumpy mess.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"GREAT brush, but runs too easily.",Shamy928,5 Jul 2021,"I've been on the hunt for the *perfect* mascara for a while now.  I tried This Charlotte Tilbury mascara and LOVED the brush.  It separated, lifted, and lengthened my lashes.  I have pretty long lashes to begin with, so I wasn't looking for length, but it did a good job.  My biggest complaint was how easily it ran.  I mean, I was caught in a rain shower and had to run to my car and it was streaming down my face when I got in and looked at myself in the rearview mirror.  I don't want a waterproof mascara because I'm lazy and just want to wash my mascara off with soap. Someday I will find my perfect mascara match!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
am i the only one?,nishaaaat,5 Jul 2021,"omg i love this mascara! i have long lashes but unfortunately they‚Äôre thin and straight. this does exactly what it says. after i curl my lashes, i apply a lash primer from lanc√¥me and then apply this and it holds my curl throughout the day and creates volume in my lashes. i LOVE it. it‚Äôs good without the primer as well.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
meh,icecheermom,2 Jul 2021,"This was just okay. I think the Legendary Vol 2 mascara by CT is far superior. 
If you are looking at this strictly for the push up factor I think the Clinique Lash Elevating mascara is superior and it costs less.  The downside is the Clinique is the very devil to remove.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Long Lush LASHES,SarahJay614,30 Jun 2021,"I LOVE this mascara! I've tried a variety of different ones. I was wearing Essence's Lash Princess and thought it was decent especially for the cheap price tag. I got a sample of the Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Push-Up Lashes and fell in love! I have decent-length lashes but always want them to look longer, and this definitely almost makes them look fake-lash long. There's a bit of a learning curve using the wand but definitely give it a try!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
meh,tcoop8,28 Jun 2021,"I loooove trying new mascara samples from Sephora but unfortunately this one isn‚Äôt a fave. I tried this mascara with and without primer to see different results. Without primer, it barely gave any volume to my lashes. I had to do 3-4 coats to get some kind of a noticeable difference with my lashes. When I used this with primer, I saw only a slight improvement with the volume and fullness, however the product still goes on light and is difficult to layer. Overall, I would not use this in the future.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,parfait1,27 Jun 2021,"This is going to be a return for me. I hate the brush and it is very hard to work with the formula. It clumps and it smears. I normally love Charlotte Tilbury products. But, I think I will stick with Dior show.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Annex1,25 Jun 2021,"Causes major clumping. After application it smudges everywhere as it takes forever to dry. Smudges throughout the day after it‚Äôs dry. (This is while trying it with Lanc≈çme and Dior lash primer). While sitting in the hot tub in the evening exposing it to that level of humidity, lmao; I looked like fright-night. 

Horrible, horrible product. Embarrassing that money is charged for this ‚Äúmascara‚Äù if one could call it that. I am laughing at the question on the screen as I type this review - ‚ÄúWould you recommend this product?‚Äù",Tilbury,Mascara,No
disappointed,Stacy85,24 Jun 2021,Wet formula that does not separate. I had high hopes for this mascara and was extremely disappointed. The formula stays wet and smears. Due to the wetness I am unable to apply multiple coats without my lashes becoming three separate clumps. I will never purchase this and cannot wait to move forward with a new option,Tilbury,Mascara,No
clumpy mess,calicomikeneko,24 Jun 2021,"Not easy to apply, super difficult to clean. Just a big mess! The worst mascara I‚Äôve ever used.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Solid alternative to my Too Faced BTS mascara!,carline,23 Jun 2021,"I received a deluxe sample of this with a recent purchase.  I like it, it's a nice mascara but I wouldn't consider it better than Too Faced's BTS. Pros: very black, fairly easy to apply, lengthens well, didn't have issues with smudging or flaking, does seem to hold lashes lifted.  Cons: Hard to get good separation of lashes (you WILL need a lash comb!), doesn't give great volume (compared to TF's BTS), brush isn't the easiest to work with.  Full disclosure, I use Dior lash primer under every mascara so this comparison to TF BTS mascara is wearing both mascaras with my lash primer.  (Dior's lash primer is AMAZING!  Holy grail for me for sure!  Makes every mascara look better and makes my lashes healthier!)",Tilbury,Mascara,No
no thank u,BabyPeachG,23 Jun 2021,"I would honestly give no stars if I could. this mascara was good for one single stroke and then immediately starts drying out and clumping. the clumps were so thick that I couldn't seperate them with a sewing needle. I don't know what this formula is but it's really, really bad. don't recommend.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,SooMuchMakeup,22 Jun 2021,I loved this when I bought a mini size. When I purchased the full sized it was old I guess. I purchased this April and did not open it until late May because I wanted to finish the mini. I could hardly get product onto the brush because the formula was stiff. So as much as I loved the mascara and the brush  I am hesitant but will try again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,heyhey1973,17 Jun 2021,Didn't care for the brush and found the formula to clump if you put more than application of product. Will keep using my Lancom Hypnose!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,parfait1,13 Jun 2021,"I enjoyed the formula of the mascara. But, I hated the brush. It feels like rubber on your lashes. Sadly I will be returning this one.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,rosiejosie90,13 Jun 2021,"I am glad I got a sample size. At first the formula was great to work with since it was a little dry. However, by the end of the day it would smear all under my eyes after doing non intense work in the office. I tried it several times making sure I set my under eyes well. Still major smearing on my under eyes. I tucked this away to come back to it later and it‚Äôs completely dry and no product will come out.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not too bad,hifranklin,11 Jun 2021,"Went back and forth between 3 & 4 stars. It‚Äôs ok, the brush is fine if you like the little plastic-y style of wand. This is one of those mascaras that gets better when it starts to dry out. The formula is a bit too wet in the first few weeks of using and I have to take extra care to separate my lashes with a comb or I end up with 5 spiky lash clumps.
Really works for lengthening but I need a second mascara with a fatter brush to add volume",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not it.,ohshedid,6 Jun 2021,"I was really excited to hear that charlotte tilbury came out with a mascara because I love her other products but this one was beyond disappointing, it didn‚Äôt live up to the name. I found it didnt apply well and flaked off.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

"Doesn't push up for long, smudges too easily",chramapal,3 Jun 2021,"Been using it for a while and really wanted to love it. It smudges too easily under my eyes- most mascaras do- but it also doesn't seem to do a good job of holding my lashes up as they immediately start to fall after applying. I have medium-length, straight eyelashes that typically fall back to normal by the end of the day after using a curler. That being said, I'm only willing to wear falsies if I'm going out. So this mascara just didn't work for me at all. I like the applicator, though, I think it applies mascara well.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Just awful!!,madamebrigine,3 Jun 2021,"Definitely a sucky experience. The first, yes the FIRST, tube of mascara I ordered arrived completely dried out. I went in store to exchange for a SECOND fresh tube. Though it wasn‚Äôt dried out, the formula generally seems a bit drier than what I prefer. Not a fan at all.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

dry no products inside,Miramarmar,21 May 2021,I think I got a bad one I used one time and it was dry or not enough products inside I am very upset I really wanted to try this in that pic I try very hard to layer products on my lashes I must of did like 10 layers. But still so dry,Tilbury,Mascara,No
AMAZING,JetteH,21 May 2021,I don‚Äôt rite a lot of reviews but this mascara is freakin amazing. I‚Äôm a mascara junkie; I‚Äôm always trying new brands and choosing my favorites. This is def top 3.

"Length, yes; Volume, no.",aquilesalves,18 Apr 2021,"So glad I purchased the mini to try out because this was a disappointment.

Good mascara - needs quality control,Rink619,14 Apr 2021,"This a great mascara, but I find the formula to be quite inconsistent from tube to tube!

,nurseblue,8 Apr 2021,"I‚Äôm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. I‚Äôm very picky when it comes to mascara. I‚Äôve been obsessed with Fairydrops ever since Sephora used to sell it, however it‚Äôs nearly impossible to find now. I‚Äôve tried many different mascaras hoping they would be as good as the fairydrops one and none of them came close until now. My lashes look full and long with the pillow talk mascara.

Gets every lash,MrsArnott,1 Apr 2021,I love a wand like this to get every lash and lengthen them out before I hit up the ends with a fatter mascara brush. I‚Äôve found there is no one size fits all but I love the way this works in my multi step routine.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
OB.SESSED.,DeepBlueC,1 Apr 2021,Sooooo good. The asymmetrical brush is awesome. I love that the bristles are well-defined and I‚Äôve found that the varying lengths allows for easier application on those sometimes tricky lashes on the inner and outer corner. I looove how after coating the base of my lashes I extend outward and they just keep getting longer!! With a lash curler this is THE BEST alternative to false lashes. Packaging is adorably chic as always. Buy it!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,goodvibes4all,31 Mar 2021,"Very flakey/crumbly formula. LOVED the wand, it‚Äôs too bad the formula cannot last a day without finding flakes on my skin (only applying to upper lashes). 

Avid mascara experimenter and so far my top mascara choice is marc jacobs velvet noir.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not for me,ywoe,31 Mar 2021,This mascara immediately took the curl out of my lashes. The wand didn't work for me. I guess I prefer the fluffy wands rather than this comb-like wand. My mascara routine is like this: curl my lashes and apply translucent powder around my eyes and letting it get on my lashes so the mascara applies better. I did that and when I applied this mascara my lashes lost their curl! I put my usual mascara (TF better than waterproof) over this one but they just didn't look good.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
must have,Raerae6,30 Mar 2021,This is one of the best mascaras I‚Äôve ever used. The brush combs through your lashes and doesn‚Äôt clump up. My lashes look fuller and longer. Plus it doesn‚Äôt feel dry and flaky like some other brands.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
GET IT. NOW.,caric323,25 Mar 2021,"Any other mascara you have, throw it out and buy this instead. The negative reviews, I‚Äôm really not understanding. Everyone says it smudges but I‚Äôve never had that issue. It looks like i just got lash extensions.
Tip: to keep from smudging, apply this AFTER you use your setting spray. Any mascara I‚Äôve ever used has always smudged if i applied it before spraying a setting spray. If you apply it after, it won‚Äôt smudge at all. 
Ignore my hair towel in the photo, the lighting opportunity was too good to miss lol",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Clumpy Volume, no length",Stella138,25 Mar 2021,This was disappointing after all the hype. Very clumpy and hard to remove.

,mmenard,24 Mar 2021,"So disappointed in this mascara. I love the other CT mascaras and thought I would give this new one a try. It causes my lashes to clump, doesn't add curl and flakes. I have stopped using it after a week it is that bad.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

smudges !,RoxanneLachance,3 Mar 2021,"Want to love it so much !

NOT for naturally thin/short lashes,meowdieval,1 Mar 2021,"I usually like CT skincare products, so I decided to give this mascara a try after it got an outrageous amount of hype from the ‚Äútesters‚Äù at Violet Grey (who usually seem to recommend reliable products, from what I‚Äôve seen). First off, I have terrible natural lashes; if I‚Äôm not wearing any mascara it looks like I just don‚Äôt have lashes at all (seriously). So I‚Äôve found over the years that not all mascaras are good for my lash situation (riveting) but I‚Äôve also found a handful of mascaras that somehow not only make my eyes look normal, but they manage to add volume and curl (basically, to do what Pillow Talk advertised it would do) without leaving clumps or flaking off throughout the day. This mascara goes on thick, for me at least, and once you‚Äôve accidentally gotten a clump on a few lashes it‚Äôs basically game over, take it all off and start over because it‚Äôs never going to look pretty after the one mess-up (I think that is related to the weird brush shape, but again, it could just be my weird lashes making this bad mascara seem even worse).


TL;DR - not worth the money whatsoever; stay away if your lashes aren‚Äôt naturally at least visible on your face before eye makeup; clumps easily and doesn‚Äôt clean up well",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Long lasting product both on eyes and on the shelf,phntmlvr,1 Mar 2021,"I absolutely love this product.  During the pandemic lockdown I was hard pressed to find a mascara that gave me thicker fuller lashes with substance to last.

However, I started using this in September - I live in the Northeast (of the USA) and as winter weather set in, this mascara would completely sweat off my lashes in the cold. Every time I go outside, my lashes get all wet and black liquid drips off them. I really wanted to love this mascara, but it's definitely not one to wear in the outdoors, I guess.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Perfect mascara,susanwilk,22 Feb 2021,Beautiful eyelashes after wearing this product! You can wear a little or a lot either way the look is dramatic and perfect every time. This will be the only mascara I buy from now on! No more wasting money on something that doesn‚Äôt work. This is your new favorite I promise,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Long & full lashes,whyandottewife,22 Feb 2021,Bought the mini to try and was really impressed - so much so that I went back & bought the full size.  Does what it claims to do and lasts all day.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
length a s volume,elmofo,18 Feb 2021,This mascara is absolutely divine. It adds insane length and volume. Plus it lasts all day and night. No running. No flaking. No transferring. Just pack it on and comb it through and you‚Äôll end up with the most beautiful lashes you can have this side of extensions.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
This should not be for sale,jesseaj25,16 Feb 2021,It so dry it won't even apply to my lashes or anything I'm confused by how awful this product actually is,Tilbury,Mascara,No
you need to know how to use a wet formula,chinxilla613,16 Feb 2021,"This is one of the better ones out there. Makes my lashes look so big and full like I‚Äôm wearing falsies. HOWEVER ladies, this is a wet formula meaning you have to let the wand dry a bit before applying. This will help avoid clumps or transfer to your lids. A wet formula means the mascara will also last longer. With drier formulas they work great for the first few weeks and then become dry and useless. This mascara will definitely be in my rotation.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Skinny lashes,sharict,15 Feb 2021,"This was recommended by an employee in the store I have used the other Charlotte tillsbiury mascara that was wonderful she recommended this one, it was awful no volume no fullness! I now use my old wand to make my lashes look fuller",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Waste of money,dprince19,11 Feb 2021,Does not lift like it says. Even just as a regular mascara it‚Äôs too dry and doesn‚Äôt go on nicely. I like my drug store cover girl mascara better than this,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not my favorite,JessBelair,8 Feb 2021,"I wanted to try a new mascara so I went with this one as I typically love Charlotte Tilbury products. It goes on a bit thicker than I'm used to, but the real problem comes when I go outside and it seems to melt off my eyelashes. I live in a cold climate and this is a problem I've never experienced before.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Threw it away - clumping mess,RivalM,4 Feb 2021,"Love the lipsticks so was excited about the mascara.  The brush just didn't work for me and perhaps I didn't have the patience to learn to use it correctly.  Also it smeared under my eyes.  I tried a few times and ended up just throwing away (I should have returned, but COVID - whatever).",Tilbury,Mascara,No
nope!,sanaa89,31 Jan 2021,"This mascara isn‚Äôt great, unfortunately. It‚Äôs a really wet mascara so it goes on clumpy almost right away. Since it‚Äôs wet, it can be really messy while applying. If it ever gets in my eyes, it burns (only for a sec or two but still!). If you cry with it or your eyes water, expect it to smudge everywhere. When taking it off, if it gets in the corners of your eyes, it becomes stringy. It‚Äôs just a mess over all. It does do it‚Äôs job as in when I wear it my lashes look longer and fuller but the mess that comes with it, just isn‚Äôt worth it. I would not buy again and can‚Äôt wait to finish the one I have so i don‚Äôt waste the money spent on it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

don‚Äôt bother buying honestly,dxriii,30 Jan 2021,"did absolutely nothing to my lashes. literally no difference with or without it:( thankfully i got the mini version to try it out. reading other reviews saying they loved it and that it lengthened their lashes and gave them volume, unbelievable honestly. the applicator bristles are almost too short to get anything onto the lashes. no matter how many coats apply still no difference no nothing at all. i truly wish i was kidding:( hope this helps!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,xsarah,29 Jan 2021,"I had been using Benefit Rollerlash for years and wanted to try something new, and decided this one may work well. I LOVE IT!

Lasted about 3 hours,lauratkd,27 Jan 2021,"I wanted so badly for this to last. It looks beautiful on the lashes but after 3 hours i had intense raccoon eyes that continued throughout the day. If smudging is a common problem, this might not work out for you.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,WinsMama,26 Jan 2021,I‚Äôm obsessed with everything C Tilbury but this was a big disappointment. Maybe I got a wrong batch but was extremely dry and was a blah effect . Not worth it .,Tilbury,Mascara,No
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,cassidymc18,24 Jan 2021,Im not one to leave reviews often but to say the least I was VERY disappointed with this product. It was so dry I couldn‚Äôt even put anything on my eyelashes. I even tried adding a little water to it to loosen up and it was like they had no product in the bottle. Will not be buying again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Might be my favourite mascara but smudges,Binarow,23 Jan 2021,I really want to absolutely love this mascara because it really makes a difference in my eyelashes and I love this type of brush. BUT the only downside is that it smudges under the eyes after a couple hours. If it weren‚Äôt for that this mascara would be PERFECT.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Would not buy again.,randaderkson,20 Jan 2021,"I really wanted to like this. I had high hopes. That being said, it didn‚Äôt do anything special for my lashes. It coated them but I didn‚Äôt notice any additional benefits.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Terrible plastic brush, smudges, transfers - awful",,20 Jan 2021,"Sadly, this might be the WORST mascara I've tried in years. Not only is the brush terrible and flat, the formula smudges and transfers so badly. I was incredibly embarrassed after looking in the mirror after wearing it for only 2 hours to find that it was ALL over my eyes. And I was face-to-face with people the whole time!! So awful.

I've tried it with two different concealers and it did the same thing both times, so I know it's the mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudges under eyes after several hours,rspiegel,19 Jan 2021,"This would be awesome mascara if it didn't make my eyes look like raccoon eyes after only a few hours. The brush is really awesome and makes my eyelashes look long, thick and separated. The problem is that only a few hours after application the bottom lashes start to smudge under my eyes making me look like I slept in it. I'm returning it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Put your eyelash curlers away, Girls!",ThatGalSal,19 Jan 2021,"New. Favorite. Mascara! 
I‚Äôve tried many other mascaras claiming to curl and lengthen and have ended up with no curl and clumps. 
This mascara does exactly what it claims! With one application my lashes are fuller, longer and  pushed up with no clumping!
That‚Äôs saying a lot from someone who has baby fine lashes that grow straight out. 
Bye-bye eye lash curler! I‚Äôm thrilled to eliminate this step from my routine!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Glor4,18 Jan 2021,"I think this may be the first mascara I toss after only one application because I genuinely can‚Äôt use this! I applied and thought it was fine, didn‚Äôt do anything amazing for my lashes, I think mainly my lashes need thickening and this doesn‚Äôt focus on that. But it gave a natural okay look. After a few hours of normal wear I had huge smudges under my eyes, like comically so. I‚Äôve never had anything like this before. Horrible",Tilbury,Mascara,No

I want to love it but,BlondeLongLash,13 Jan 2021,"I have long, blonde lashes. I‚Äôm always looking for volume without a clump. I LOVE the way this mascara shapes my lashes, but it does smudge about an hour into wear - without provocation. I would repurchase if it didnt smudge. Its lengthening, defining, and great brush to get in and apply on individual lashes. But I‚Äôm not here for raccoon eyes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"good mascara, but not much of it",Elizabeth577,12 Jan 2021,good mascara. but the bottle has very little product in it and runs out fast.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Messy mascara,natloveslaw,11 Jan 2021,"I wanted to love this mascara but the wand makes it very difficult to apply. Every time I use as instructed I get mascara on my lid and have to remove it with eye makeup remover because it is really hard to come off. I am thinking of trying to use it with disposable spoolies so I can really get
some use out of it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best Mascara I've Used in Years!,iowachelsea,8 Jan 2021,"It took me a bit of practice to get used to application with the uniqueness of the wand, but I absolutely love this product. My natural lashes are pretty thick but very flat. It attaches well, I have no problems with clumping even though I put in a lot of layers from a lot of angles (and I'm two+ months into my first tube, still no clumping), and the best part is I don't have to curl anymore! I watched a tutorial with some tips to apply, but really, I just kind of stroke it on in all directions until I like how it looks. For me, this is only useful for top lashes though. I use something a lower key for bottom lashes because they're a lot more delicate.

Overall I love it! Won't look back.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,skepmolly,8 Jan 2021,"While I do enjoy this mascara, I don't love it. For reference, I have thin lashes that are neither too short or very long, somewhere in between. Also, I always curl my lashes with an eye lash curler. Using the mascara as recommended did not work for me. It dispersed too much product and weighed down my lashes. I then tried it just combing through without the flat side and it was an improvement, but I could only go a maximum of two coats and the result left my curled lashes slightly straightened out. If I go more than two coats, the product balls up on the tips of my lashes. The best application method that worked for me was to use a waterproof mascara first that separated my lashes right before this mascara. My lashes look like I've gotten a classic style of eyelash extension. Not a lot of volume, but I've definitely got more definition in my eyes.

What I enjoy about this mascara is the pigment it adds to my lashes. Charlotte's mascara's generally have great pigment, but won't hold up a curl. This particular Charlotte mascara is the best at holding up a curl. My hope is that Charlotte Tilbury will come out with a waterproof mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
I really wanted to like this...,cheaptrick1,7 Jan 2021,"At first it was amazing and my lashes looked full and really long. HOWEVER, after a few months I noticed my eyelashes have had breakage and now they look horrible. Had to trash it, total bummer too. Can‚Äôt recommend.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
NOT FOR STRAIGHT LASHES,nicolechapaa,6 Jan 2021,"I have straight lashes (downwards), after I curled them and applied this mascara.. they looked great for a few seconds but then they quickly straightened again. If you have curly lashes naturally.. it could work for you.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

eh okay..,marivictoriaa12,1 Jan 2021,"I‚Äôm super picky with mascara, I purchased the mini to test this out and it was okay. I won‚Äôt be repurchasing but I‚Äôm glad I tried it! It smudges just a tad, it is super black but it doesn‚Äôt volumize my eyelashes, only lengthens them!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Sevss,1 Jan 2021,"I really enjoyed this mascara. My lashes look so long, thick, and dark. It lasted all day, but four stars because it started to flake around 3pm. But I had it on since 6am that day, so I was expecting it! Really nice!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,lizzy00000,31 Dec 2020,I write this with chunks of mascara In my eyes and smudges on my under eyes. I hate it. Ive had it on for less then 4 hrs. Can barely see. Waste of money. Didn't even make my lashes look good.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Beautiful lashes but it's smudge city,cchong,30 Dec 2020,"There was a bit of a learning curve with the wand, but I got there eventually. It really does ""load and lift."" This mascara delivers on almost everything it promises: length, volume, lift, curl, definition... everything except lasting power. This is a recurring issue for me with all CT mascaras. My lashes look INCREDIBLE, but even with primer, powder, eyeshadow and setting spray before mascara, it smudges like crazy. I'll use up the tube as I continue to WFH, but wouldn't be able to trust this leaving the house for a whole day. If smudging isn't normally an issue for you, then definitely give this a chance. Don't come within a ten-foot pole if smudging is a concern.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
meh,VTkls82,30 Dec 2020,"I got the mini because I had read some reviews that were less than stellar.  I had high hopes for this but alas it was not a winner. I like the wand shape, it lengthened and coated my lashes nicely, and was a nice deep black. I tend to do several coats for extra volume, but on coat 2 it was clumping.  I was able to work with it though and was happy with the results. Sadly an hour in, it was smudging and down right making a mess. I don't typically use waterproof mascara, and there are far better brands out there thay will last longer and do just as good a job lengthening your lashes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
No.,vallka,27 Dec 2020,"this is one of the worst mascaras I used, returned it. It's wet and clumpy and just an overall mess, no thanks!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Works great for Asian lashes,Siakote,26 Dec 2020,Got it as a Christmas present and absolutely loving it. It is pretty expensive but so worth it for me. The packaging is absolutely stunning and it feels heavy which I think is great. The mascara it self isn‚Äôt clumpy and it lengthens and volumes my lashes great. I got Asian lashes and it works great for me. But my lashes are prolly long and thick so I can‚Äôt really talk for people with lashes much different from mine,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Returned,vinaM,21 Dec 2020,Unfortunately I returned this.  Wand has a horrible shape and it clumps like crazy.  Flakes as well. Not worth the price tag.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Does not work on my straight lashes.,mastoid,21 Dec 2020,Did not work for me. I purchased this from Charlotte's website and was very excited to try it. I have naturally straight lashes and have to curl them everyday. I enjoy a mascara that holds that curl for me...this does not. The lashes went completely flat almost immediately after applying. I tried to use it a second time by using a waterproof mascara as a base but they still went flat. I would love to see Charlotte make her mascara formulas in waterproof for us people who need it to hold a curl.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Wow, definitely worth it.",CCHelpmeWMakeup,17 Dec 2020,"So I got the mini just to try it out. For someone who has short-ish lashes that sometimes get tangled, this is great! Honestly this is better than Benefit They‚Äôre Real solely because of the bristles on the mascara brush head! 1 coat of this helped. I‚Äôm not really good with mascara, and it gets all over the place. I would definitely recommend this one! I think it‚Äôs also a great mascara to pair with Milk Mink or Benefit They‚Äôre Real. I‚Äôm definitely getting the full size soon!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,mara1628,16 Dec 2020,"I love this mascara, but the only thing is when you remove it with makeup wipes, it leaves marks that take awhile to take off, so if you don‚Äôt have a problem with taking awhile taking it completely off then buy the mascara, it does work well!",Tilbury,Mascara,No

I fell for the hype,JayeEyes,10 Dec 2020,"Decent mascara,  not life changing. I'm glad I got it 20% off. I like the formula, it's thick and dark although it can be clumpy. What I don't like as much is the brush. Which ironically is why I bought it. I have naturally long and thick lashes and I don't feel the brush pulls and lengthens as well as other less expensive options. I think it would work better for someone with short or sparse lashes.. Overall, it's ok. But I probably won't repurchase.  I'll stick to Rolllerball and Caution.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

HOLDS CURL ALL DAY,stellry231,3 Dec 2020,"Let me just start by saying I have straight lashes that do NOT want to hold a curl. Typically I need to curl them and then use a waterproof formula that is extremely nudge proof (like Tom Ford Emotionproof or Eyeko Beach). This mascara held the curl all. day. long. There was not any flaking on me at all, though I use a separate tubing mascara on my lower lashes. I have very small and slightly hooded eyes, so I loved the smaller wand and maneuverability of the bristles. Will definitely repurchase.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

"Honestly, not bad but probably not the best",Vacious,2 Dec 2020,"It does last a long time and there's no flaking, thank goodness. I have not experienced any clumping. Are there better mascaras out there? Yes, (fiber ones). But this one does the trick and does not flake (I'm looking at you, Better Than Sex). The lengthening claim isn't too impressive but it does have that quality.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
it would be perfect If it didn‚Äôt flake,Aj321,2 Dec 2020,"This would be the perfect mascara if it didn‚Äôt flake and give you raccoon eyes mid day. I am a mascara snob and after seeing a few raving reviews of this I decided to try it out. It looks great, makes your lashes look long without being clumpy or looking like spider legs. However, when I wear it I need to put a different mascara on top so I don‚Äôt have raccoon eyes. If not, I have raccoon eyes a few hours in. I live in the south and couldn‚Äôt imagine wearing this in the summer with all the humidity we have.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Clumpy and Thick,lovjustinbieber,1 Dec 2020,"I got this mascara as I like to buy the mini sizes and try different products! This was a total miss for me.  The applicator did absolutely nothing helpful and left my lashes looking clumpy, short, and straight.

PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,whittyliz,1 Dec 2020,"The packaging is beautiful, but the wand is absolutely horrible. It would be 1,000x better if the bristles wrapped completely around the brush and not just on two sides.

disappointing,ChasR,27 Nov 2020,I‚Äôm no sure why this is almost a 5 star product. I gave it one star because of the fullness and volume it gives.

Not what I expected,Rippzaa,21 Nov 2020,"My least favorite mascara thus far. It kept separating from my lashes and accumulated near my tear duct.

limp lashes,jfrey,20 Nov 2020,"The only thing I like about this mascara is the brush head. You can get to the root of the lash with the fine, short bristles. The formula however, does not hold a curl, it‚Äôs definitely not volumizing and it ended up smeared under my eyes by lunchtime. I‚Äôm giving it 2 stars for the brush. I would not repurchase this product, and the only reason I am not returning it is because of the pandemic.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
New Fave,M7284,20 Nov 2020,"It perfectly separates my lashes and doesn‚Äôt clump at all. The brush is narrow, so it is easy to use the tip to get the corner lashes. Two coats is needed to create volume. This is my new fave mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,Maxeyki,15 Nov 2020,I purchased the mini and I‚Äôm glad I did. All the online rave about It I thought for sure it would do wonders and I was so wrong. I have drugstore mascara that performs better than this. It did absolutely nothing for length nor volume so I gladly returned the mini size and was happy I didn‚Äôt invest in the full size.

Smudges too much,RochaK,12 Nov 2020,"Lengthens well without clumping. Brush is very thin so it‚Äôs easy to apply onto all of your lashes. Decent length for someone who doesn‚Äôt have long lashes.

Every YouTube review I watched of this mascara showed major drama which I just found not to be true in my case. I tried both using the brush like any normal brush and also following the brand's instructions, but I get a very natural look that also transfers to both my upper lid and underneath my lower lid causing raccoon eyes. Returning, and super bummed. 

For the record I have fairly oily eyelids but pretty dry undereyes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,tinasimone628,10 Nov 2020,"The packaging of this product is cute and I really wanted to like it! However, the applicator brush, while great in theory, makes for a very messy and clumpy application. Even with the most careful application, the brush was too long and oddly shaped so it was getting mascara all over my eyelids and eye creases. Also due to the shape it can get clumpy in some spots. The nice thing is that it is long-lasting and doesn't smear or slip once you it is applied and dried. The color is a nice, deep black.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Creates lengthy, full lashes",appleofmyivy,9 Nov 2020,"I think this is a great mascara, it gives me a lot of lift and thickening, and I can see a noticeable difference in how full my lashes look in one swipe. I wouldn't recommend things for bottom lashes at all truthfully, it tends to be a bit too thick to do that without transferring but for upper lashes? It's fantastic.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,chibistar,8 Nov 2020,Only length but did not give me curls.... when apply you see it curls but give it 5 min then it went straight. Returned,Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Big, separated lashes",ad0rebella,7 Nov 2020,"The first time I used this, I brushed it on just with the bristles. Great separation, great length. Then I started using it with the flat side first, rolling over the bristles. This gave it a thicker look. 2 for 1 mascara!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
not bad at all!!,bambinita,6 Nov 2020,I like it so much better than the other 2 mascaras from Charlotte. This one does deliver lengthy lashes and with a little bit of volume. The wand has a nice precise application for each lash so overall is a good mascara! Worth the price and value of it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Hard to work with,Joibot,6 Nov 2020,"It's a little hard to work with.. You really need to use the sides properly and even if you do that sometimes it gets a little clumpy.. it's okay, but definitely not in my top five.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best in the game!,DressageQueen86,5 Nov 2020,"I'm extremely impressed with this mascara. wow. seriously! I am usually a lover of too faced better than sex mascara, tarte surfer curl and big ego mascaras but this blows them out of the water! This doesn't take any building up to get a full volume, dimension, length and definition. This also stays on forever until you decide you wanna take it off. I use Latisse so this is all me as far as length but this really brings my lashes out. No flaking,  no clumping, and no transfer. I live in hot and humid Florida so thats a must for me. This also made my bottom lashes look gorgeous. (I bought this myself)",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Good but not Great.,satanswaitin,5 Nov 2020,This product is great but it has its faults. I received it for free from Influenster in my Charlotte Tilbury VoxBox and was really excited about it considering a I needed a new mascara and was receiving this one for just giving my opinion. However I do have to be honest and although the formula is fantastic the wand is not. It causes for excessive amount of clumps and thick looking lashes If not held in the perfect position,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Must buy,BaileeHaas,5 Nov 2020,Absolutely obsessed with this mascara! The ingredients are great and the packaging is super cute! The application is effortless and my lashes look natural yet thick long and gorgeous,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great mascara with a learning curve,PaigeBobb,5 Nov 2020,"I received this product through Influenster to try. I am in love with this mascara and have recommended it to many people! It has a bit of a learning curve, as the brush is unique. Once you figure it out it works great! I included pics with and without the mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
New Cult Mascara,Jilaine,4 Nov 2020,"Besides the fact that this mascara is a little too wet at first, I absolutely love the formula. It separates my lashes without looking spider leggy and I adore the way that the applicator is built because it allows you add that volume with the flat side. Very innovative! Would buy myself!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
best mascara!!!,ChanDesai,4 Nov 2020,"I received this through Influenster and I LOVED IT. The application is flawless, it doesn‚Äôt get messy and my lashes look as though I have falsies on which is crazy! I love love love this and will be purchasing! I usually use the YSL mascara but this takes the cake!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,KalieAnne,4 Nov 2020,This mascara stayed on all day but it clumps easily.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,DixieFlatline,4 Nov 2020,"I have super dense lashes that aren't particularly long, and really wet mascara formulas usually glue them together. This does not. You also don't end up with way too much product on the wand. It doesn't seem to run much, either even though it isn't waterproof -- I cried watching a movie and didn't have raccoon eyes after. It doesn't do a lot for me in the curl department unless I curl my lashes beforehand, but the length is pretty great!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
love it!,prettyvulgarart,4 Nov 2020,Honestly I love this! The thing is I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs better than anything else. I think it‚Äôs pretty on par with the other mascaras I use such as better than sex and man eater.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,sammysuss,4 Nov 2020,"While this mascara gave my lashes a ton of length, when I do more than one coat, it tends to get clumpy. Because of how wet it is as well, it tends to make my lashes droop a bit as well. I need to test it in a combo with other mascaras to see how to get the best results. I am going to keep using this to see how I can get it to work well for me. I received Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Volumizing Mascara for free in exchange for my honest review from Sephora and Influenster VoxBox program.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not a fan...,carissj,4 Nov 2020,Honestly I had high hopes for this product but minutes after applying It my eyelashes immediately fell and just looked droopy and heavy. It did not keep my eyelashes‚Äô length or volume and just made me look like I had dark eyes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,paigek18,4 Nov 2020,So amazing and the application is perfect. I use this on my bottom lashes since I have lash extensions and it helps them flow so perfectly. I‚Äôm they almost look fake! I would definitely recommend to anyone wanted to try out a new mascara!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Charlotte Tilbury x Influenster Review,Blondiebb,4 Nov 2020,"I am very pleased by the end results of using this product! The Charlotte Tilbury Volume and Lengthening Mascara is one of the best mascaras I've tried so far. This item is great for days when you don't want to wear false eyelashes or want to add volume to a pair of falsies. The product itself, inside the mascara tube is very potent in color and one coat of mascare was all it took to give my lashes a longer and thicker appearance. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants or needs a two-in-one mascara!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,mroudy,3 Nov 2020,"This product is luxury mascara. I usually prefer just lengthening mascara, not volumizing due to clumping and flaking, but I have had none of that with this. The brush has two sides and isn‚Äôt too large. I would definitely recommend.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Quick look mascara,AprilM1,2 Nov 2020,"I like the mascara for a quick on the go look. It does give length and some volume. I noticed it tries to clump up your lashes, if you do a second coat. I like to brush through my lashes to separate them so just have to be careful doing so. The wand has thin bristles that are perfect tor combing through. I noticed it likes to run a little bit not to much but enough you will have to clean up here and there. 

This mascara id say is perfect for a date night but not so much a party all night one.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,alinahussain,2 Nov 2020,"I'm loving this mascara from @influenster and @ctilburymakeup. It's called Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes! I especially love the packaging! The light pink/rose gold combo is stunning. The formula is smooth and non-clumping. It's definitely a game changer! I hate it when my mascara clumps, so this one was a pleasant surprise. Normally, I have to separate my lashes with a separate lash wand. It's very easy to use with little-to-no smudging. It's lengthening, voluminizing, and amplifying. The dual-sided wand really makes a difference. I'd definitely recommend this mascara if you're looking to up your lash game.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Do not use in wet/humid/sweaty environments,JaiElf,2 Nov 2020,"This is not a beginner‚Äôs mascara! It will take time and finesse to apply properly; but once you do, the results are absolutely stunning!  I completely stabbed my eye the first 4-5 times I applied it.  The paddle shaped brush just kept spinning in my fingers, and if you don‚Äôt have optimum lighting, you can‚Äôt see the difference before the brush is in your eye. However, the paddle is also what gives you beautifully thick and long lashes. This is the third time I have used this style of brush, and it tends to work really well when swiping all lashed with the flat side, then using the bristled sides to fluff, and smooth the mascara. Charlotte Tilbury‚Äôs Pillow Talk Volumizing Mascara provides the perfect lashes for a wedding, ball, runway, or event; but is not something I would regularly wear. It chips and runs as soon as it‚Äôs near any humidity, and will definitely not hold up in the south.

,Kayluhhhhhhhhhh,2 Nov 2020,"This is one of my new favorite mascaras. The wand is a little funky shaped, but was easy to use once I read the instructions on the box. It separates and adds volume to my lashes nicely. I can do several layers without it looking clumpy. I had no problems with flakiness or smudging. It‚Äôs also very comfortable on the eyes. It doesn‚Äôt feel heavy at all. I don‚Äôt even notice I have mascara on. It gives you the sexy, bedroom eyes effect, but can be worn every day.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not Worth the Money,livystan,2 Nov 2020,"I have to say, I feel like these reviews rating it so highly are strongly influenced by the fact people received complimentary product and thus tend to be slightly less critical. I received it complimentary as well, but it is simply not a very good mascara, especially not at the high price tag. 

- this does smudge / flake - it‚Äôs a pet peeve of mine and it gave me raccoon eyes after about 3 hours of wear. 
- the wand is really difficult to use. Based on the way you‚Äôre supposed to apply the mascara, you have to pay a ton of attention and if you‚Äôre not really really careful, it‚Äôll go south super quickly. I used this about ten times and applying it never got easier. 
- the difficulty of application also did not result in an AMAZING mascara look. Had it looked insanely good after applying it, I might have given the challenges a pass. But there was no real pay off. It looked incredibly average in my opinion. 
- the price tag! At almost $30 for a mascara, it better amaze me. It didn‚Äôt though so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anybody. 

I‚Äôve tested a lot of mascaras and this is one of the worst I‚Äôve tried. Don‚Äôt spend the money! There‚Äôs much better at this price point - get an Hourglass or Lanc√¥me mascara if you want to splurge!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,HaydeeMac13,2 Nov 2020,"I‚Äôve been using Chanel Le Volume mascara for years but decided to switch it up and try something new. After trying like 10 mascaras this is my favorite! It‚Äôs on the dryer side (for lack of a better word) but it isn‚Äôt flakey. It gives you a nice natural look and separates all your lashes. It does a second coat really well without getting all clumpy and gross. Definitely no flaking or smudging throughout my long day working in a hot bakery. On days were I want a little more of a bold look I put Benefits They‚Äôre Real! on first and use Pillow Talk as a second coat! It may take a minute to get used to the funky brush, but you‚Äôll end up loving it! Definitely worth a try!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,aliciajade13,1 Nov 2020,Subtle with one coat but builds beautifully without clumping! Finally.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love It!,kellbie21,1 Nov 2020,"I am in love with the color or this mascara! It lifta and volumizes so well and never leaves smudges when being removed at night. As a clumsy person, the only critique I have is with the comb. It is easy to poke yourself in the eyes and it is a but more pointy than other brands. Other than that, an amazing mascara!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love this wand,asrip,1 Nov 2020,"Loved this mascara.  The wand is very helpful, maybe there would be a learning curve for beginners but, one you learn how to use it you will never go back.  I received this product complimentary through influencer.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Life changing,Katey22,1 Nov 2020,"I very rarely buy high end mascara, but this mascara is one I would for sure consider buying. It has a very unique wand shape that might take some getting used to, but it makes such a difference. It gives my lashes the perfect amount of both length and volume without being clumpy or flaky. It isn‚Äôt waterproof, but it is one of the longest lasting mascaras I have tried. I received this product completely to try, but one of runs out I will definitely want to buy a replacement.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Kassie6,1 Nov 2020,"This mascara made my lashes look amazing! They looked so long and full all day. The only downside was by the end of the day I did have some smudgy black streaks underneath my eyes, so for my longer, more busy days I opt for a backup mascara. It's great for my less busy days though, I absolutely love it! 

I was given this product for free to review. I would definitely buy it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Insane wear!,attorneychick,1 Nov 2020,"My new favorite mascara!  I love the pink and gold packaging - it definitely doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. There is a bit of a learning curve with the wand, and it took me a couple of tries before I was able to deposit the perfect amount of mascara with the flat sides, but the comb is amazing at removing clumps. The mascara itself gives me crazy volume with separation and curl, but the best part is the wear!  It doesn‚Äôt flake, doesn‚Äôt irritate my eyes, and it wears FOREVER. I have to use dual-phase remover to completely remove it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Karleynicolee,1 Nov 2020,"This product was middle of the road for me. If I could make an improvement, I would change the brush. It is really good for lengthening, but not for volume. It does kind of clump the lashes as well. However, it does stay on really well and does not flake. These attributes are very important to me!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Beautiful Lashes,MeaganManess,1 Nov 2020,I received this product free for testing purposes. I love this mascara! The pink and gold packaging is nice. The wand is easy to use and leaves my lashes looking long and full. There is no clumping or flaking. I definitely plan on using this in the future.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Decent,blaws31,1 Nov 2020,"I like this mascara but it‚Äôs not my favorite. The wand was definitely a learning curve and makes it easy to get way to much product on your lashes. However, once you learn the wand you can make your lashes look amazing. I also like that it last all day and doesn‚Äôt flake off or transfer. I gave it 4 stars bc I would prefer a different wand. I received this item for free to try and review, but I would purchase it in the future.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Favorite mascara of the year!,Laycia43,31 Oct 2020,"I am a mascara lover but I am very picky about them as well! I have long lashes but they are not thick at all. This mascara not only makes them thicker but longer too! It lifts my lashes nicely. It has a learning curve since the wand is so unique but once you get it down it lifts and seperates so well! Since one side of the wand is flat and holds a good amount of product, you don't have to keep inserting the wand into the tube over and over. That is really nice since everytime you insert a wand into the tube it pushes air into the tube which slowly dried out your mascara! It isn't a wet nor a dry formula, it's right in the middle. It didn't flake at all. I have issues with transfer with a lot of mascaras since my eye lashes touch almost to my brows but this mascara didn't transfer anywhere. Even though it stays in place so well it was very easy to take off once I was ready to remove it. I removed it with wipes or soap and water and had no issues. I love the pink and gold packaging too! It looks so feminine and classy.This is definitely my favorite mascara to be released this year!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Fuller Lashes,Mimochii,31 Oct 2020,This might be my favorite mascara. It doesn‚Äôt clump and it does do it‚Äôs job with curling and lengthening. I noticed I can get my lashes to look fuller too if I apply it several more times. It‚Äôs easy to take off and doesn‚Äôt rip off my natural lashes like some other mascara does.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Buy it!,anjali1328,30 Oct 2020,"absolutely OBSESSED with this mascara! No clumps and doesn‚Äôt irritate my eyelids. Gives amazing volume and my eyelashes have stopped breaking so easily since I began using this. Definitely recommend for those looking for a good, healthy mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love the lift and separation!,AEHMartistry,30 Oct 2020,"I was not expecting to love this mascara as much as I do! I was surprised by the wand when I opened up the tube, it is a silicone wand with 2 sides being flat and the other 2 sides being pointy combs. The key to this mascara is using the flat side to first coat the lashes (which helps get a nice base along the lash line to make lashes appear more full) then you comb through with the bristle side. My lashes look full, long, separated, and very black. The only downside to this wand for me is I almost ALWAYS seem to poke myself in the eye which then makes me blink and smear a ton of mascara under my eyes lol! While that is just user error I had to knock of a star because it is SO difficult to remove if it gets on your skin. Usually I can let a mascara dry and swipe away a smudge with a q-tip, but this does not work! I have to use makeup remover to get off and really scrub, but I have to be gentle not to remove makeup I already applied. Very frustrating. I also don‚Äôt love the price, but that is what it is. Charlotte Tilbury is a high end brand, so this price point is to be expected. I just hate that I love it! Lol!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love!!!,DeeAnnLee,30 Oct 2020,The packaging is so luxurious but even better than that it actually does what it says. It lifts and lengthens so beautifully. At first the wand is a little strange but it‚Äôs actually perfect for the application. It grabs all your lashes and separates them so nicely. Really love this product and would buy it again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,lyraluna9,29 Oct 2020,I loved this mascara.  I have been set in my ways for years and was never able to find something to compare to what I had been using but this does.  It goes on easy and makes my lashes long and thick. It stays on all day and is easy to take off,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Lifted and elongated!,Cbell8,29 Oct 2020,"This is one of my favorite lifting mascaras I‚Äôve ever used. I love the dual edge wand which makes application easy. I‚Äôve used several mascaras from high end to drug store and this is one I will continue to buy for years to come. It makes my lashes look lifted and curled. I was given this as a sample from Influenster for my honest review... however, this is literally the best product I‚Äôve ever received!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,jamiel002,29 Oct 2020,"I have issues with mascara a lot. However ive been using this one lightly and i love it so far. It makes my lashes long but not clumpy n no flaking what so ever. :) 

I recieved this product free for testing through infuenster.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
The best mascara I‚Äôve used,CatPerson1999,29 Oct 2020,"As my headline says, this is the best mascara I‚Äôve used. The wand makes the difference. Long, full lashes without clumping. Stays all day. I love love love this product. It makes your eyes pop. When everyone is wearing masks, you have to make sure your eyes stand out and this product will help you do that. Have had so many compliments on this and this will always be my go-to for dramatic and easy lashes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,JVanCamp,29 Oct 2020,"I really wanted to love this product, especially with how great the design/packaging is. BUT I just didn‚Äôt think it was spectacular. The brush is pretty tricky to get a hang of and if you do it wrong it‚Äôs clunky and I didn‚Äôt find it very lengthening or volumizing. It did last all day, but I just think it was pretty standard. Can get a better one for less money.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Okay,dev1998,29 Oct 2020,I really don‚Äôt enjoy the brush but it is a beautiful black color.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
High hopes ... dashed,vibrouge,29 Oct 2020,"Alas, every Tilbury mascara I have tried gives me raccoon eyes. And this was no different. I liked the brush and had high hopes but nope. Smudge city pretty quickly after putting it on. Tilbury is one of the few that smudges so badly on me.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,snarro,29 Oct 2020,"I really like this mascara. The wand is a little weird but works well enough to make my lashes super curly. It doesn‚Äôt clump or flake either. It‚Äôs also super easy to take off, which I appreciate. I would buy it again if I had a little extra money to splurge.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best mascara I've used.,kiayafallis,29 Oct 2020,"I received this from influenster complementary to try. and I absolutely love this mascara, doesn't clump goes on nicely and stays all day. this Is my new go to mascara. it makes my lashes look so long and full. and the wand is awesome. will definitely be buying again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great!,Breeannaalexiss,28 Oct 2020,Honestly one of my new favorite mascaras by far! It look be a bit to get a hand of the wand but I love how it performs. Literally one of the longest wearing mascaras I have and it doesn‚Äôt bother my sensitive eyes!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
It‚Äôs a keeper!,Mfmua,28 Oct 2020,This mascara formula and combination of wand and packaging is definitely a win! As soon as I receive this I was automatically drawn in by the packaging but definitely fell in love once I was able to try the application and formula. As someone who wears glasses during the week to work I still like for my eyes to have a little something even though I typically don‚Äôt wear make up during this time and this mascara is the perfect pick me up! Wearing glasses it can be difficult to find a mascara that doesn‚Äôt flake Or irritate my eyes and luckily this does neither. The wear of this mascara is quite impeccable compared to others that I‚Äôve tried due to not only the longevity but how it looks even after hours or a full day of wear. My lashes don‚Äôt look doll or dry they honestly Have a subtle but beautiful Shane almost giving the appearance that they were hydrated and nourished if that makes any sense. If you were looking for a mascara I would definitely recommend this one hands-down. And an added bonus is that you definitely get your moneys worth seeing as the tube is huge! I would love to see them come out with this formula in some thing like a dark brown or maybe a carbon black in the future but for right now this is definitely a hit with me.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,brittbotni,28 Oct 2020,"This mascara feels so expensive! The packaging is gorgeous and the wand is heavy enough. The product goes on smoothly and really does lift and fill your lashes. The mascara is very pigmented and gave perfect coverage. On the other hand beware, the mascara takes quite a while to dry and very easily smudges when first applied! I also found the the wand has a bit of a learning curve, but overall will continue to use this product!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
a great mascara,CaraOates,28 Oct 2020,so far i‚Äôm loving it!! gunna definitely use again!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing Formula,StaceyLynch,28 Oct 2020,Amazing mascara product!! Elongates and plumps up with lashes with no clumps!! Such a great formula!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing,anjad693,28 Oct 2020,This product is great. I like how it Gives my lashes the full volume and along with that the length. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who would like to get that full non clumpy lash look.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Worth the hype but use the wand correctly!,stephanieanna88,28 Oct 2020,Does exactly what it says it does BUT it must be used correctly. Follow the instructions for using the wand and you will notice how much it volumizes your lashes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Excellent mascara,anneada,28 Oct 2020,"I wanted to give try this for a couple of weeks before reviewing and the verdict is that I love it. For me, the trick is to apply a light coat with the bristles and then use the paddle side to add product and then comb through with the bristles. They say to use the paddle side first but I had better results when I put a bit on my lashes first to give it something to hold on to. Sounds like a pain but it only takes seconds to build amazing length and volume. I still curl my lashes beforehand (habit maybe?) but I‚Äôm so pleased with the results. I even got asked if I‚Äôd had a lash lift by a friend. There is some very minor smudging for me but I have NEVER had a mascara that didn‚Äôt smudge on me no matter what tactics I try so I‚Äôm not knocking any marks off here because it‚Äôs just me. This wears very well through the day with no flaking.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
100%!!,Justtjesss,27 Oct 2020,This mascara blew me away! The brush helped get the product on my lashes flawlessly and didn‚Äôt experience any clumping! Will be buying more in the future as I received this tube as a promotion through influenster.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not my fav,chloebreriggs,27 Oct 2020,"I really wanted to love this mascara, but it‚Äôs definitely not great... my biggest complaint is that it smudges on my eyelids/beneath my brow bone and under my eyes A LOT. As soon as I fix it the next time I look in the mirror it is smudged again. I love the applicator and the way my lashes look long and natural, but I definitely don‚Äôt want raccoon eyes. There are better mascaras, and I won‚Äôt purchase this one.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great but needs a little help,reneemarybeth,27 Oct 2020,I love this mascara but I do have to use it with a thickener mascara. It really lifts my lashes but it does need a second mascara to look perfect for me.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Super black!!!!!,Itsmilley,27 Oct 2020,"I really enjoyed this mascara. It was super black and it didn‚Äôt flake. The wand was not my favorite because I enjoy fuller bristles, however, this mascara was really good. I loved how full and black my lashes looked! I received this product via Influenster complimentary.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Maggy,27 Oct 2020,"I like how I only need two coats to get the desired effect. The brush helps elongate my lashes and is easy to use. Doesn‚Äôt add to the thickness of my lashes, though I wish it did. The only real downside is the formula is ‚Äúwetter‚Äù than others and takes longer to dry. Because of this I have to be careful or my lashes clump together or leave a mark on my upper lid.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,KiSkyler,27 Oct 2020,"I really like the formulation of this product & how deep and dark the black is. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the brush, it took me a few tries to really figure out the best way to use it since the bristles are so short. I prefer to use this mascara on my bottom lashes or to blend my lashes with falsies.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,tinainmiami,27 Oct 2020,I don‚Äôt get the negative reviews as others have mentioned. I love this formula and applicator. Provides volume and extension. No clumping or smudging.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Too hard to use and not that great,Moonlou,27 Oct 2020,"Really hard to work with because of how wet the formula is. At first I quite liked it even though I had troubles using it, but now it has just become too annoying to use. Now not only is it hard to build, but the product inside has started to dry and it creates clumps immediately. My lashes can definitely look better with other mascaras, it is not terrible, but it is not that good either.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Strong Color, Clumps",lowelch3270,27 Oct 2020,"This mascara is beautifully packaged and carries a weight to it so you know it is a higher end product. It definitely applies an abundance of product to your lashes, but i wish the applicator brush was more bristled because the lashes definitely clump together in spikes, and then i have to separate them. However, in only a couple swipes, the material attaches strongly and stays throughout the day. Definitely not waterproof or tear proof though.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Looks great...NOT waterproof though,jbabbie12,27 Oct 2020,"I really like the brush, and I love the way it makes my lashes look-they are bold and full...but the woman that helped me in the store convinced me that it was ""waterproof"" -which is is NOT. If I don't use waterproof mascara, the mascara will ultimately end up smudging on the tops of my eyelids/under my eyebrows, and this is the case with this mascara. I'm pretty bummed about it because I truly like the way my lashes look with it! But, it definitely is NOT waterproof. Also, even though it rubs off on my eyelids.....it is REALLY tough to take off-even with waterproof eye makeup remover.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,MandyAnn21,27 Oct 2020,"It took me a bit to use the wand without some clumping, but once I perfected the application...this is my new favorite! I will be replacing the complimentary one I received from Instagram with a new one. So happy!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great for a Bit!,annadance,27 Oct 2020,"I received this product and had extremely high hopes. When I first started wearing it, I LOVED it. My lashes were so long and they didn‚Äôt look clumpy at all. I love long lashes that are light as a feather and this definitely accomplished that. However, I knocked a few stars off because it had fallout throughout the day. As a college student, I have long days and stay out late with friends and I would come home to my eyes having fallout underneath. It isn‚Äôt long lasting, but it is great for a dinner party!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Switching to this one!,nicolepar,27 Oct 2020,"so so good, 10/10 recommend. i‚Äôm replacing my better than sex w this",Tilbury,Mascara,No
lashes arent great to start with,valeriefcarney,26 Oct 2020,"I've always struggled with mascara its very underwhelming to the point that i just put falsies on usually.  I do like the applicator it doesn't get too clumpy but the formula stays wet for quite some time so layering was difficult.  I loved how it made my bottom lashes look, separated & thick.  Packaging is beautiful vintage glam as Charlotte always does!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Definite YES!,Aymankhaku,26 Oct 2020,I really love this mascara. Its perfection. Honestly with this mascara you really don't need to use eye lashes - the product makes your eyelashes look natural and colonized. Also loved the applicator and how it prevented lash clumping. Highly recommend this.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing,meganhh,26 Oct 2020,Loved it!!! My favorite mascara yet. It lengthens my lashes so much and gives such a model cat eye look!! Will be repurchasing!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Lengthening Mascara!,laurenchristine,26 Oct 2020,"I absolutely love this mascara, the applicator has little bristles on it that work like a brush so they brush through your lashes to declump which also lengthens them at the same time.  It really lifts your lashes as well, I only used one coat but I might try two coats next time!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
My lashes look amazing!,Felicia516,26 Oct 2020,Wow this mascara is amazing! Makes my lashes super long and a creates a gorgeous curl. No clumps like some prestigious brand mascaras that I‚Äôve tried in the past. I‚Äôve found my holy grail!! Absolutely would recommend. Such a great formula!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great on the go!,littledoughnut,26 Oct 2020,"Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes Mascara does exactly what it says. It really holds the curl of your lashes all day and helps them look longer and volumized. The formula is perfect if you are in a rush, two swipes is all you need to fully coat your lashes, you do have to be careful not to go overboard because it can get clumpy with too much product. The dual sided ‚Äúload & comb‚Äù wand took a little time to get a hang off ‚Äì  the flat side of the wand is used to load product on and the rigid side is used to brush your lashes out. I personally, prefer to start off with the spikey side and then go over the base of my lashes with the flat side to add a little more volume. The packaging is so adorable! I love rose gold and pink everything. Overall, it‚Äôs a great mascara if you‚Äôre in a rush, I do wish it was waterproof though, I did experience occasional transfer but nothing too bad.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
BEST MASCARA,sadgalizzy,26 Oct 2020,"I really love the fluffy, sultry look this mascara gives you! My lashes get separation and length while still giving lift and volume as well. It‚Äôs beautiful and so is the packaging.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Torinceann,26 Oct 2020,I really liked this mascara because it has such a fine brush that it gets all those small left behind spots. My only complaint is that it dries out very fast.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

AMAZING,Slm8,26 Oct 2020,I received this as a complimentary gift! It‚Äôs the BEST mascara i‚Äôve ever used! I definitely recommend !,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,zibbybroms,26 Oct 2020,i really love this mascara! it helps lengthen my lashes and keep a curl !,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,bridgetlee,26 Oct 2020,This is a lux mascara! I received a full size sample. The pros are that it is highly pigmented and greatly helps darken and volumize lashes! The con is personally for me it didn‚Äôt pass my smear test... I had a little smear under the eye after wearing for a few hours. I think this depends on individuals. Otherwise the packaging feels luxurious and love the weight of the package including the weight of the handle which surprising helps with application and just all around feels like a great product.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
New Favourite,BlingItWingIt,26 Oct 2020,I‚Äôve tried so many mascaras on the market and I really do have my favourites but I‚Äôm so glad to have found this one. It lengthens and curls without clumping and makes the eyes look wide open.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
GET IT,VixanaFlowers,26 Oct 2020,"Amazing mascara that provides volume, length, and long wear!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,ryann97,26 Oct 2020,I really enjoy the build ability of this mascara. The only minor thing for me is it is a little hard to take off with a makeup wipe.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
so so,Eforaker,26 Oct 2020,"I am a big Charlotte Tilbury fan. However this mascara just does not give much volume or length. The brush is odd, flat on two sides which delivers too much product. The end result is clumpy, messy lashes. I wanted to love this, but it was not for me.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great!,ShaEssence,25 Oct 2020,"I really love this clump-less mascara.  The two steps to achieve beautiful lashes was an great idea! My lashes always look so natural and long. Also, I don‚Äôt have to deal with any shedding from the mascara getting into my eye after a long day. Overall, I would definitely buy",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Sarathesharkie,25 Oct 2020,"I am so shocked by the reviews, this mascara is amazing! I bought the mini to test it out and ended up ordering the full size. I use the Dior primer as a base and the products work very well together. 

It‚Äôs a great mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
a new favorite,forever18,24 Oct 2020,"Big surprise of this year! Separates lashes perfectly, adds length without clumpy fibers...lashes look incredibly long and natural! Better than extensions for much less ....",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,TyMyDy,24 Oct 2020,"This product is good in the areas of pigment and wand application and how long lasting it is. However, personally it wasn‚Äôt the best fit for me, I like my lashes to be bold and separated and voluminous. This product didn‚Äôt do that for me, however, I did want to see if it was useful else where and it was. Instead of using it for my lashes I used it for my brows, and I just loved how well it looks in my brows compared to other brow products. I felt like I had more control doing it this way than with anything else. So if you don‚Äôt buy it for your lashes at least buy it for your brows.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
would not recommend,LMM123,24 Oct 2020,I wanted to love this mascara. Loved the way it looked after put on. However it smears so badly. A couple hours after I applied it would be smeared all around eye. Did not work for me.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Full lashes,Kerrigann,23 Oct 2020,I really like how fluffy this made my eyelashes! It lengthens a little bit as well but mostly makes my eyelashes very full. The downside is it slowly leaks throughout the day under my eyes and I hate it when that happens with mascara. The concept is really cool where are you scrape the mascara off and then brush it through your lashes. I would be interested in trying a waterproof even though I don‚Äôt normally do that just to see if it doesn‚Äôt leak as much.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love the applicator,viradia,23 Oct 2020,"Love this mascara! The applicator is my favorite, it‚Äôs smooth and gets every eyelash to make your lashes full! And make your look more dramatic.  I recommend this product",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,LGerk20,23 Oct 2020,"I was a bit skeptical of how much this mascara could do for my lashes because the wand was skimpy looking. I applied it as suggest on the box and it worked great! My lashes were evenly coated and fanned out and it added nice length. It wasn't super voluminous, but I really liked the lifted and long look that it gave. I took a star away because I did notice it start to flake and smudge after a few houra of wear. Overall this is a nice mascara and i would absolutely purchase it in the future!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Decent Mascara,laceyrobin,23 Oct 2020,"I‚Äôve been using this product for about a month now on and off. I initially hated it because I was using the product the way that they instruct you to and it was making my eyelashes super lumpy. The wand is shaped weird and I think that‚Äôs why it causes there to be clumping. I think if it had a different wand, it would be a better product as the formula for the mascara itself is nice. It super bold, smooth, and doesn‚Äôt budge all day. If you get this product, I recommend either using a different wand all together or just using the part of the wand with bristles and skipping applying with the flat part all together. 

Also, if you‚Äôre looking for a lot of mascara, I don‚Äôt think you can beat the price for the amount you get. It‚Äôs a huge bottle. 

Overall after a few uses, I did decide that I preferred my other mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,kendizzy,23 Oct 2020,"At first, I was really skeptical about this mascara. The structure of the wand is so different than what I‚Äôm used to. One use and I was over that almost completely! This is a really good mascara. The formula is thick, but not too clumpy (I had issues with clumping early on, but once I was able to perfect my application, I didn‚Äôt have any more issues.) I recommend trying this!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great mascara!,VictoriaJ89,23 Oct 2020,"Love this mascara! The applicator is my favorite, it‚Äôs smooth and gets every eyelash to make your lashes full! Will definitely purchase in the future!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,mkhan1003,22 Oct 2020,This mascara is great at lengthening however it does smudge. My lashes don‚Äôt look clumpy and it does a wonderful job of fanning my lashes out. Makes my short Asian  lashes look long and voluminous. Would recommend.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,emilykay129,22 Oct 2020,Amazing product! I absolutely love this I will be buying again!! Goes on smooth and last forever,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,nicolezlot,22 Oct 2020,This mascara is so so good! It makes my lashes super defined and not clumpy. The only thing is that the brush cuts off on each side so sometimes your lashes can‚Äôt catch the brush,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love hate,vicmackin,22 Oct 2020,This mascara is really great at separating and lengthening lashes however it doesn‚Äôt add volume like I usually like. I also find the mascara messy the wand collects a lot of extra product which leaves unwanted marks on my under eyes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
This is a good mascara length wise but ...,ariyana98,22 Oct 2020,I really loved how this mascara made my eyelashes look long and thick when they are short. Somedays when I didn‚Äôt feel like wearing my false lashes I‚Äôd wear this and I loved it. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about this mascara was I wasn‚Äôt able to wear it on my bottom lashes without it smudging on the bottom :(,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Exquisite Mascara/great for thin lashes,anella,21 Oct 2020,"I absolutely love this mascara. I will admit there is a bit of a learning curve. Once you master it, you will fall in love with this mascara. My top four reasons I love this mascara: 1) you do not have to re-dip the wand for more product. The flat side of the wand supplies plenty of product. I recommend curling your lashes first, apply the flat side of the wand to the base of the lashes then comb through. 2) the silicone brush. The bristles are excellent for sparse, short & thin lashes. Mature ladies, I recommend this mascara for you. It gives volume, curled & separated lashes. 3) you can create a minimal or full fanned out last look with one mascara formula & wand. 4) the formula is the perfect balance between being not too thin or too thick. This mascara is for all lash types, but I highly recommend it for mature eyes/lashes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,CarlyFaith,21 Oct 2020,I love this mascara! I received it for testing purposes but will purchase in the future. It separates each lash and gives a very full and natural look. Also amazing to put on after applying falsies to help blend your natural lashes in.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Go to mascara for length,clocuts,21 Oct 2020,This mascara has quickly become my go to! It lengthens my lashes and adds nice volume. The product is long lasting and does not smudge or flake. I received this mascara complimentary via Influenster and definitely recommend! The wand took a little getting used to but it does apply well!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Bolatito,21 Oct 2020,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever used a mascara that worked before using this product. I haven‚Äôt always been a fan on mascara since I just wear lashes but when I‚Äôve tried mascara in the last I saw no relative difference until I used this mascara. It makes your lashes thick and long that I sometimes skip wearing fake eyelashes altogether. I would def recommend buying it bc if I run out I‚Äôll be buying more for myself. Lol,Tilbury,Mascara,No
One you have to try but you may not love it,karen2829,21 Oct 2020,"Mascara is such a personal thing, I don't think there is one mascara everyone will love. For me I have long lashes but they are on the thin side (for reference my wholly grail is Dior Overcurl Mascara) while I love my Dior mascara, for daytime its TOO much drama so I am always looking for a good daytime mascara. For me this mascara does just that, for me this mascara can give you great length and separation. I am sure you can build it up but like I mentioned, I am looking for subtle daytime look. My problem is that this RUNS on me. I have normal skin, not oily and no reason for this to run. The first time I used it, it did not run but the moment I had to be outside or actually be exposed to the elements.. I ended up a racoon. So much for this being humidity resistant. For $30 this is going back.  This is my 3rd attempt at using her mascaras and they have all failed. Super sad considering I love most of her stuff. 
If you made it this far, my best suggestion is try it. It is one worth trying for use,",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best Thing EVER,hb00,21 Oct 2020,"I don‚Äôt normally bother with reviews, but I have to on this one. I have been through so many mascaras, it‚Äôs embarrassing. This does not smudge and give me raccoon eyes, it stays ALL day, and it gives insane volume. I was asked if I was wearing fake lashes. Try it. You won‚Äôt regret it. I‚Äôve bought everything from covergirl to Chanel and nothing can touch this product. Hands down.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love it!,AndreaK13,20 Oct 2020,"I had heard mixed reviews of this mascara before trying it myself, but I was pleasantly surprised! My natural lashes aren‚Äôt very long, but I was impressed by how long and full they looked after a few coats of this mascara. The formula and brush were a little difficult to work with at first. After a few attempts, I thought it looked great, and I‚Äôve been using it as my go-to mascara. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs comparable to the Buxom mascara (another one of my favorites). I‚Äôll definitely continue using it!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Not the Best, not the Worst",JanetRose,20 Oct 2020,"This takes awhile to learn - if yr lashes are sparse and short like mine you need to roll the wand around so that the flat end paints/thickens and the brush end extends. If you get the knack then Yes, y'll have that Push Up look. If you use flat edge first and then brush yr lashes will look long and feathery. If lashes dry between coats, they will flake like crazy. Pros: Easier than most to remove, excessive tugging away not necessary. Cons: Time-consuming to apply. Beware of inclement weather, a few raindrops, wind, snow and Heeeelllooo racoon eyes. Do not recommend.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Catgurl16,20 Oct 2020,"I got this and thought the good reviews and it being new would win me over. I have been sorely disappointed in this product. It‚Äôs very wet, takes a while to dry, smudges and flakes. While I like how it‚Äôs very generous with the product when applying, I kinda hoped it would stay ON my lashes. No thanks.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
IMPRESSIVE,nalorenamakeup,20 Oct 2020,"let's talk about this mascara is very impressive, I do my makeup and always used false lashes because my lashes are really short , but my surprise is pillow talk push up lashes this mascara is amazing my natural lashes look long and beautiful, my only complain it's that takes a while to dry.

Great mascara,yoselinz,20 Oct 2020,I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I‚Äôve tried many mascaras and I usually hate them. I was pleasantly supieses how well this one works. It didn‚Äôt clump up my lashes and it made a curling effect on them without me actually curling them. Highly recommend.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,mochamae2007,20 Oct 2020,I received this product complementary from Influenster and I really love it! It pushes my lashes up while also keeping a great curl to them. They look full and long and don‚Äôt clump! I would recommend!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Wow!,Mediajunki,20 Oct 2020,I am super skeptical about mascaras that promise the moon. Let me start off by saying that I have never tried anything Charlotte Tilbury before I got this mascara complimentary from Influenster. This mascara has completely changed my makeup game. My lashes are thick and separated with just the right amount of length. I am floored by this mascara! This brush is unique and super functional too. I will be buying this again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing curling!!!,Sabyna92,19 Oct 2020,"I received this from influenster complimentary for a review. 
this claims to have a vertical lift effect for 24 hours. I usually go for lengthening and volumizing in my mascara so this was the most curling one I have ever tried and WOW. It LIFTED my lashes. The brush is so unique, at first glance I thought it was going to make my lashes stick together because it is flat with very very short bristles on two sides and in the past those haven‚Äôt worked for me. I pushed the flat side against my lash line to lift/ curl then used the skinny bristle side to separate and define the lashes. This is the best high end mascara I‚Äôve tried. Usually I find luxury mascaras to be over hyped. This is the only one I would actually purchase. I‚Äôm a huge fan!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,kajabsi,18 Oct 2020,"I am in love with this mascara. I received it from Influenster to try out, and I will definitely be purchasing in the future. With one swipe I get amazing length and even though it isn‚Äôt waterproof, I have had little to no transfer.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Nice Mascara,AineMaeM,18 Oct 2020,I received this product as a complimentary sample. This product made my lashes appear noticeably longer which I loved! It would have been 5 stars except sometimes when using it the wand makes my lashes clump together - but typically it does not happen. I would purchase this product again!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Good Formula // Goop-y Brush,cja2,18 Oct 2020,"I really wanted to love this. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever disliked a CT product, but the wand just deposits too much product and isn‚Äôt spike-y enough to comb through your lashes. The formula is good though. Nice color and no flakes. Packaging is cute too. Received to review; wouldn‚Äôt purchase.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Clumpy, spider leg lashes, irritates my eyes",joanna84,18 Oct 2020,"I‚Äôve tried multiple brands and their mascaras (Dior, Hourglass, KVD, Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs, Chanel, YSL & drugstore mascaras as well-Maybelline etc) and I decided to give this a go since a friend recommended it. Ive come to the conclusion that if you have short lashes this product is not for you. The wand does not have many bristles, it leaves you to keep using product over and over again and once you can even build up the lashes they‚Äôve started to clump and look like nasty spider legs. It irritates my eyes as well.. going in the trash. I‚Äôm disappointed I wasted money on this. I‚Äôll be sticking to my Marc Jacobs mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,Kelllllly,18 Oct 2020,I love this mascara! I use it in my everyday makeup routine. I like it‚Äôs applicator. I would definitely recommend this product.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Edennj,18 Oct 2020,"First off, I love the packaging on this mascara! It looks and feels very luxurious. I do like the product itself, however there is a bit of a learning curve when using it since there is a LOT of product on the flat ""load"" side of the wand. Especially on the first few uses, it can be challenging not to get too much product on the lashes (and on your eyelids) which makes it a little too clumpy for my taste (hence the lost star). After the using up the product a bit though this problem pretty much goes away. I like that you can also get the ""light liner"" look very easily by applying the mascara at the base of the lash without actually having to apply eyeliner, so it can be a two-in-one situation. It's great for voluminizing and lengthening, but didn't separate the lashes as well as I like, but that's a personal preference and easily fixed by combing through with a dry wand after application. Overall, it's a great mascara once you learn to work with it!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Thick and full lashes!,BKPop,17 Oct 2020,"I received this mascara to try complimentary of Influenster. This mascara provides such volume and length! I love the applicator wand, as it individually targets each of my lashes and gives me that fuller, fanned-out look. I wish more mascaras had this kind of applicator. My eyes definitely pop! However, I did have some issues with thick application and clumping. A few times I got so frustrated and had to redo my mascara completely. It really does what it promises ‚Äì but be careful of how much product is on your wand.. it may turn into a mess... however, removal is easy. Caution with multiple layers! It is a bit more on the expensive side.. and I‚Äôve been able to attain the same full look with other brand mascaras. I‚Äôd consider purchasing if you‚Äôre still in the search for your go-to mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
My new secret weapon,damasaur,17 Oct 2020,"I received this mascara from Influenster to review. 
 Revolutionary! I have natural long and curly lashes, and most mascaras just make them linger but don‚Äôt do much more. This mascara with the unique wand it has, I can pack on the product without it clumping and weighing down my lashes. The formula is lightweight and forgiving. Even though it‚Äôs not waterproof, it acts like a waterproof mascara. I have very oily skin and most mascaras migrate by the end of the day, but this one, wow! I love it and will most definitely purchase one when I run out.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Annanicole45,17 Oct 2020,"I received this product free in an influenster campaign. So I liked this, but honestly the applicator is pretty odd. If you‚Äôre not pretty careful it‚Äôs really easy to get a lot of product on your eyelash. However when you get the hang of it it‚Äôs not that hard and your lashes look great. As far as wear though I found I got a little smudged after only a few hours after applying it. All in all it‚Äôs fine.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,hudsonballenger,16 Oct 2020,I liked the effect this had on my lashes. I will say though that I have used more affordable mascaras that have the same effect. I like the packing as always with Charlotte Tilbury products but I would spend my money on her flawless filter product before the mascara.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great!,sambbbb,16 Oct 2020,This is one of my favorite mascaras. It doesn‚Äôt smudge and makes my lashes feel really thick. Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the flat part of the wand.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Pretty Good!,Saturday100,15 Oct 2020,I really enjoyed this mascara! It works well and lengthens my lashes. My only complaint is that it is super watery and is hard to not get it on my eyelids while applying.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Boom volume,Athena05,15 Oct 2020,"I recieved this product free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. 
 
This mascara is pretty much budge proof after the first day you open it. I haven‚Äôt had any flacking or smudging for the past couple weeks.  It gives great volume but not much length so my lashes look kind of clumpy when I use it on my lashes. The color is really black which is a huge plus . I also like that it washes off without a huge drama or mess.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,maaalllooory,14 Oct 2020,"This mascara gives such a voluminous look! I don‚Äôt like to use heavy formulas because my lashes are already decently long, but this is perfect. You really only need one layer and it spreads so easy! I work long hour days and hardly ever see any type of fallout or smudging which is another super big plus!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,kayleyyy5,14 Oct 2020,This mascara is my new favorite. It lasted so long even through wind and sweat. My lashes still looked natural just longer and more volumized. My new favorite!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Cute but...,Ninicntn,14 Oct 2020,This mascara does look very cute on the lashes. It gives volume so obviously if you use too much it clumps and it lengthens but it‚Äôs not as much as the advertisement. It isn‚Äôt smudge proof and overall I think it‚Äôs too expensive. I only use one side of the wand since the other makes it clumpy so the wand design is whatever.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
definitely recommend!,dancergirly,14 Oct 2020,"The Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes Mascara made my lashes look amazing. It gave my lashes volume and made them look fuller. As a contact lens wearer, I did not experience any smudging which was a dream come true!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Formula could shine with a better wand,jgoodnight,14 Oct 2020,"I actually like the formula of this mascara, but the wand doesn‚Äôt let the formula do it‚Äôs job. The formula is thick and creamy, like others have said. You won‚Äôt want to layer. But one coat is plenty so you won‚Äôt need to. It‚Äôs good coverage with decent lengthening. It needs a minute to dry. If you want to swipe and go, this isn‚Äôt for you. If you‚Äôre okay fanning your face for 60 seconds, eyes wide trying not to let lashes touch anything, then you‚Äôre fine. I feel like a lot of this would be overcome with a better brush, with bristles that are less tight. This brush does a terrible job with even distribution, which is part of why the formula feels so heavy and smears if not allowed to dry.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,lexrhino,14 Oct 2020,"Packaging and product design is very attractive and aesthetically pleasing. Good formula.
Wand isn‚Äôt my favorite",Tilbury,Mascara,No
The wand is fabulous!,MeNotYouToo,14 Oct 2020,I received this mascara as part of a promotion and I absolutely love it. The wand is the key. It‚Äôs not the best mascara for layering but one base coat seems to be enough for everyday wear. I pair it with a different mascara for a second layer when I want to go bolder. Will buy this again. Great quality.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing,leytehannah,14 Oct 2020,Love love love this mascara! I‚Äôve been looking for a new mascara so I was pretty happy when I got this in the mail. It doesn‚Äôt clump or run at all. It makes me tiny lashes pop a bit more. At first the wand was a little bit difficult to apply with but I got better with each application. Definitely a must try!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,RachelJarvis,13 Oct 2020,"I love this product! It really lifts and lengthens. It does not build up volume as much as something like Lash Paradise, but the natural lengthened effect is so nice. I would definitely recommend!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,lindsay829,13 Oct 2020,I wasn‚Äôt particularly impressed by this mascara but not bad either. It does a good job at lengthening but i always seem to get mascara on my eyelids which is annoying,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,rebeccasreality,13 Oct 2020,"Let me start off by saying I love the packaging! The wand and formula leave a bit to be desired though. I find that the mascara itself can be a bit too wet/sticky making it hard to separate lashes properly. The wand is awkward and excess product builds up on the flat parts and at the tip. Usually get smears while applying or shortly after. Doesn‚Äôt feel like it fully dries either. My lashes feel heavy and almost itchy after wearing for 8 hrs. It‚Äôs not the worst mascara I‚Äôve tried by far, but definitely needs some improvements. I wouldn‚Äôt purchase this product. There are many that are superior on the market.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,laurenrees737,13 Oct 2020,"I absolutely love this mascara! The difference in my lash length is insane and this mascara was suprisingly not clumpy on my lashes.

love!,Erica1794,13 Oct 2020,"Really loved the product, and the packaging. The wand was probably my favorite of all the mascaras I have used. I felt like it applied the product evenly and actually made my lashes look longer.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Jessicaavila3,13 Oct 2020,I really love this mascara! It‚Äôs become the only one I use since I received it complimentary from Influenster. It lengthens my lashes without clumping them and the wand catches the perfect amount of product from the tube. Absolutely would recommend.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
MY FAV MASCARA,saybooxo,12 Oct 2020,I‚Äôm completely obsessed with this mascara. I‚Äôm always looking for one that gives me extremes volume but isn‚Äôt overly clumpy and this is it! I love how it has the flat end to apply the product then the brush end to feather them out. My new favorite product and 10/10 recommend.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love this mascara,jenncpilarte,12 Oct 2020,"This mascara it is really good , it gave my lashes nice volume and it is super long lastong . I hightly recomment it .",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing mascara!,natalieemalin,12 Oct 2020,I loved this mascara! The only thing I didn't like is how small the brush is considering I have very thin eyelashes it looked kinda clumpy! But overall it is creamy and applies beautifully!,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Plumping but wish it gave more length,Syzzle,12 Oct 2020,I absolutely love this mascara‚Äî however I wish it were more lengthening. I have stubby asian lashes so the need for length is real. While this mascara does a good job I do not think it is my top performing mascara in terms of holding a curl and giving length although the volume facet is perfect!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Lashes thick and full,swoonie33,12 Oct 2020,"I have tiny lashes and they are super light. This mascara,  plus this great brush, gave me lashes that looked like false lashes. I was super impressed,  and my daughter  thought I had false lashes on, when we had our  Thanksgiving  dinner , virtually . I don't wear mascara  every day, but if I'm popping  out, this will be my go to mascara , especially  as emphasis  is on our eyes, now that masks are worn.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Push up for sure!,gabrielleishell,12 Oct 2020,I love how this mascara instantly made my lashes appear fuller and more voluminous!! The packaging is cute and application was easy! I will definitely be using again!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Read instructions! Your new favorite!,kellibesr6819,11 Oct 2020,"When I tell you I love this mascara... I hated it to begin with but it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt read about how to use the applicator! Once I did, I used the flat side to pack my lashes and the brush side to drag through the ends... fabulous! Gives me so much volume and color and length. Attached photos will be after ONE application. Some even a side by side! 10/10",Tilbury,Mascara,No
not worth it,dkitty1,10 Oct 2020,"waste of money,  I've had many drugstore mascaras that were much better",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Read the instructions!,edgeofautumn,10 Oct 2020,"This is replacing my Defencils mascara. If you read the box and apply as instructed, you‚Äôll be rewarded with tons of volume, length, and separation. I LOVE this mascara!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Worst Mascara I've Tried In Decades. Truly.,Vallor,10 Oct 2020,"Trying to use this is more of a hassle than it should be, or even needs to be. The brush is functionally useless; applies too much product you can't brush out, then weighs down your lashes and smudges as result. Even if the formula was amazing, the time and hassle of application isn't worth it. I truly haven't used a mascara this horrible in decades. I'm sure there's a learning curve to using this - but it's a lesson I neither need nor want to learn; I have plenty of other superb high-end mascaras eager to do their job without the gimmicks. I was NOT given this product for free, or to try; I purchased this with my own money, wish I hadn't, and will not purchase it again. Don't recommend it either. This is my unbiased uncompromised opinion all day long.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not the best for keep the curl in lashes,Kimtini,9 Oct 2020,"I wanted to like this so much! Unfortunately this did not lift my lashes at all and only made them droop. I always curl my lashes and was looking for a mascara that would hopefully keep the curl this one completely weighed them the down and couldn't keep the curl at all. I had remove it, re curl and use the mascara that I have been using for a very long time. If you have short lashes that naturally curl up you may be okay using this.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,srhampton,9 Oct 2020,sloppy  messy mascara!  I was so excited to try this.  I'm a die hard IT cosmetics mascara customer and thought I'd branch out to this.  It's a really weird application and got all over the bottom of my top eyelid  And three hours later had raccoon circles from the mascara as well.  do not recommend especially for the $$,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Loved it,esav,9 Oct 2020,I really liked this mascara. It helped my lashes to look full but not clumpy! It was easy to apply. I will be buying again! I received this product complimentary for reviewing purposes,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great mascara for length and volume,klane721,9 Oct 2020,"I really liked using this mascara, lengthened and volumized my lashes without leaving any clumps.

Definitely worth it,BrittBradley25,8 Oct 2020,Love this. At first I was kind of iffy on the brush but now that I‚Äôm used to it I love it. It wears great all day and looks fantastic.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
great,scottio,8 Oct 2020,I absolutely love this mascara!! Adds so much volume and length at the same time. Only problem I ever have with these wands are they are sharp and hard and for some reason easier to accidentally stab your eye lol but over super bomb!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not worth it,MalloriBjerke,8 Oct 2020,"I was honestly really excited when I found out that I was being sent this product to try by Influenster as I have used other Charlotte Tilbury products and LOVED them. Unfortunately, this product definitely doesn‚Äôt hit the mark like the others. The brush would be okay for lengthening but the formula is not great whatsoever. Every time I use this mascara, it goes on my lashes and also clumps on my waterline under my lashes causing eye irritation and a HUGE mess with my makeup. I‚Äôve even tried to use this product as a top lengthening coat for my mascara but I still have the same issue. Truly this product is not worth it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Disappointed,AnnaLW1111,8 Oct 2020,"I Really wanted to love this but the brush is way to short to go through my lashes. I like the formula , it‚Äôs smooth and creamy but without a longer brush, it weighs them down. Had to spend 5 minutes combing them out after to make them look better.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,AmandaPandaCO,8 Oct 2020,"Love this mascara. Lashes are long and full, and there‚Äôs minimal smudging, even with my oily skin! The brush is fantastic-I agree with the reviewer who said build with the flat side, then comb through with the comb side. A newfound beauty staple for me!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
The best mascara!!,dbedros,8 Oct 2020,Omg this my new favorite mascara!! I‚Äôve tried so many brands and this is the winner!! This wonderful stuff although pricey is amazing and stays on all day without any fall out!! It makes my lashes look beautiful and full!! I absolutely recommend anybody looking for a mascara that makes your lashes look full and flawless to this one. I received this complimentary for my honest opinion.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
LOVE,siarahmaz,8 Oct 2020,"I seriously LOVE this mascara! The one has such fine bristles that I can really see mascara get on each individual eyelash!! It‚Äôs super long lasting and it doesn‚Äôt  smudge  which is a great perk! Also, I comes off relatively easily with my cleanser at the end of the day!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love!!,Lolo212,8 Oct 2020,"Love this mascara, I will be buying this again. The brush means there's very little to no clumping and I love the look of this mascara",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Just OK,SarahFromWisco,8 Oct 2020,I‚Äôm not crazy about this mascara. I feel like it works so great for the small bottom lashes but the bristles didn‚Äôt comb through my top lashes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great!,laurtink,8 Oct 2020,"Love this mascara! I usually use the exact same mascara, better than sex because it gives me so much volume but this one is comparable. It didn‚Äôt rub off or flake when I put it on I would highly recommend!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
My New Holy Grail!!,LES0031,8 Oct 2020,"So I wasn‚Äôt sure I was going to like this product at first because it‚Äôs not my usual wand style. But boy was I wrong!! The brush has 2 flat sides and 2 comb sides. You load the product on with the flat side and brush through them with the comb side. Which sounds like a hassle, but it‚Äôs not. Since it gives you such length and volume right away, you don‚Äôt have to do 3-4 coats like I‚Äôm used to. The product is also a wetter formula, but it doesn‚Äôt flake. I do think they could make the packaging look a little nicer for the higher price tag, but definitely worth it in my opinion!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
It‚Äôs meh...,purrrrsis,8 Oct 2020,"Positive: brush is fabulous 
Negative: it transfers. Really bad. I‚Äôm talking raccoon eyes within the first hour of application. 


Overall: I‚Äôd say save the money.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Good product - slight learning curve,angie33,7 Oct 2020,"Overall, this is great as an every day mascara, but it‚Äôs not going to give you super full lashes for a more ‚Äúdone-up‚Äù look  

Pros: 
- provides a decent amount of volume and lengthening
- didn‚Äôt flake off onto my face even after a full day of wear 

Cons: 
- the brush is odd, in that the bristles are only a couple rows on two opposite sides
- this made it difficult for me to get as much product on my lashes as I would typically like in one go",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,kseitz21,7 Oct 2020,"This mascara definitely has a learning curve to it. You have to get a handle on turning the wand as you apply it, otherwise it‚Äôll clump up very easily. Not my favorite mascara ever, but it did define and curl my lashes a bit.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Amazing mascara,95clow,6 Oct 2020,"This mascara is AMAZING!!! It makes me look like I have false eyelashes on, and never flakes. It isn‚Äôt clumpy.

Comes with a learning curve,NubianInk,6 Oct 2020,This was an interesting experience. I love the formula so much. But the brush is weird and takes a minute to get used to. You have be willing to have a product with a learning curve,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,cassschmidt2001,6 Oct 2020,I like the product and it lasted a long time.  My only complaint was that it did get a little flaky but not horrible.  Not my my go to mascara but it is still really good.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Nice!,Bailey2344,6 Oct 2020,"I was super excited to try this mascara. First, the brush is a little weird. I tried applying it the way the box recommend using the flat side and then the bristles, but it made my lashes clumpy. Applying it with just the bristle part of the wand with 2-3 coats made me lashes long and thick. However, this mascara didn‚Äôt hold a curl and my lashes were straight again within 30 minutes. Overall, it‚Äôs alright, but not my favorite.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
These Lashes Though,hannahforddd,6 Oct 2020,"This mascara is incredible. Definitely my new Holy Grail. My eyelashes have never looked so full! And with such little product needed.

long long long lashes for days,Sardinka,6 Oct 2020,"Very good lengthening mascara, makes your lashes super big without being clumpy or without fallout.

,,6 Oct 2020,Ok so when i first saw the brush on this mascara i was like im gonna HATE it! The reason being is i like my mascara brush more fluffy not comb looking !

I will pass,kitty777,5 Oct 2020,"I really wanted to love this because all the hype. It didn't do much for me. It made my lashes look like skinny spider legs.

Nice mascara,Synycja,5 Oct 2020,I really like this mascara! it really has a volumizing effect. I like the brush and how easy to work with it. Highly recommend!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Very great!,Ryleighss,5 Oct 2020,"This is my favorite mascara. It compares to and I think is better than Too Faced Better Than Sex.

Give this one a try,TLeev,5 Oct 2020,"I really want sure of the wand at first and sometimes struggled with the wand on my bottom lashes, but in the end really loved this product.

The perfect mascara!,twilliams14,5 Oct 2020,If you are looking for a mascara that creates natural looking but amazing long lashes then this is the one!  This mascara made my almost non-existent lashes look long and voluminous. I love it!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
An Enjoyable Product,QuartkneeL,5 Oct 2020,"I like this mascara. It has a nice formula and effectively transfers color to my very light eyelashes. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the brush shape,  it does not work well for the technique I use to apply my mascara, but I can see it being effective for the average user. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend looking to try out a new high end mascara!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Lashes In a Bottle !,kly702,5 Oct 2020,"Game changer ! Order now ! You won‚Äôt be dissapointed!

Love the Packaging and the Applicator!,SarahOlive,5 Oct 2020,"Wonderful packaging and I LOVE the applicator, it really grabs each lash!

I will definitely use this product in the future.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,kjs22,5 Oct 2020,"When I received this product I was super exited just seeing how the product would work because I have long eyelashes, but this made my eyelashes clump up, stick together, just overall a very bad look",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great once you get used to it!,BckwdsBruntRvws,5 Oct 2020,"This mascara is very different because of the wand shape! It is unique because it is flat and has plastic/rubber bristles on each side. On one side, the bristles are longer and spaced further apart so you can build volume, and the bristles on the other side are shorter and more condensed to help avoid clumping.  I gave 4 stars because it is not very user friendly, and it too me a few tries to grasp the concept. Now that I have, I really enjoy using it! The formula itself is not wet, it is a more mousse-like consistency, which I prefer.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Try This- It‚Äôs Actually Good,kmashae,5 Oct 2020,"I actually really like this mascara. I have a hard time justifying paying for a high end mascara because I find drugstore does the trick for me....but this one, I would really consider.

pretty lashes,CarrieAurelia,5 Oct 2020,"Overall not a bad product. I personally loved how it made my lashes look. There weren‚Äôt any clumps or mess.

Weighs down and no curl,bdglatz,5 Oct 2020,"I really wanted to like this product and was definitely expecting a magic product based on influencers and the price tag. Unfortunately, for me, this product did not help lift or curl my lashes at all. In fact, it seemed to actually weigh them down more. I have straight lashes and MUST use a lash curler, but this product did not help with the curl at all. Unfortunately, this is a no for me.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Nice!,alicia0612,5 Oct 2020,"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.

AMAZING,gcinque519,5 Oct 2020,"SO impressed. I have pin straight lashes, no mascara ever makes them curl like this! This mascara has my lashes looking curly, full, and even longer!

Wow..... Just wow!,MissPriss256,5 Oct 2020,"This mascara is like unlike any I've ever used. And trust me, I've just about tried them all. I used to wear lashes everyday, over time my natural lashes became pretty thin, so most mascara just makes them look patchy. Im not sure how but this mascara goes above and beyond. It somehow fills them in and you cant tell there are any gaps in my lashes. On top of lengthening (because on top of being sparse my lashes are also short). 

The only downside is that its real easy to get too much at the base of your lashes and end up looking cakey. This is especially true on the bottom lashes. I almost feel as if i need to use a different mascara or wand for my bottom lashes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,partialtopink,5 Oct 2020,"Great brush, excellent formula! Really separates, volumizes, and lengthens.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Too thin,brignicho,5 Oct 2020,I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. It is okay. The formula is a little thin for my liking. The brush separates lashes well.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Long thick lashes,Annabell1227,5 Oct 2020,"This mascara is a deep black, and stands out beautifully on my eyes. It can go on thick if you're not careful, so use your own lash brush or use the one it comes with carefully. I love how much it lengthens though, it's wonderful! I received one for free to review",Tilbury,Mascara,No
just okay,sephoralovescici,5 Oct 2020,"This is was just fine it's not a miracle mascara. I bought it after reading all the glowing reviews, hoping it is different than the hundred other mascaras have used. I have very straight lashes that does not like to curl so I didn't really expect it to have much hold, but I didn't really lengthen much nor was it voluming. The brush also doesn't catch on product easily and when you try to dip it in again it might get lumpy instead. The brush is also not fine enough so it doesn't separate lashes well. Overall I was not impressed, if other mascaras work (like roller lash, they're real) this might work fine.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,queensheeran,4 Oct 2020,I expected better for the price. I didnt dislike it and will use it but it was clumpy and sticky. I have full thick lashes but it made them clump together and look thinned out.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

The best mascara!!,JlynMar,3 Oct 2020,"This is a great mascara! I have a hard time finding a mascara that I love and this one is amazing. It lengthens, curls, and defines every lash. I really like that you can layer a few coats without it looking clumpy at all. It‚Äôs really good for getting the smaller hard to reach lashes in the corners and leaves your lashes looking super full.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,elizabeth36,3 Oct 2020,"Best mascara! It‚Äôs better than ‚Äúbetter than sex‚Äù, any of the Diors, etc etc. A staff member suggest it.. ‚Äúbest mascara in this stire‚Äù and I kind of rolled my eyes... thinking... yeah yeah yeah... I‚Äôve heard that before! I got it and want to go back and hug that employee! It‚Äôs fantastic! Gives you length and thickness (but not clumpy)! This is the next best selling mascara... mark my word!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not a Fan,kristinnicole7,3 Oct 2020,"This isn‚Äôt my favorite mascara, by far. It has a double sided brush to help you apply and brush out, and I can‚Äôt tell much of a difference. It clumps very easily and doesn‚Äôt like to brush out. It does not apply evenly. Not something I would ever consider buying personally.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Very creamy mascara!,bryay,3 Oct 2020,I really like this mascara! I‚Äôve received compliments for my lashes from this! The texture is very creamy and doesn‚Äôt flake at all. The wand helps lift and lengthen (not sure about the curl part though) and makes the lashes look long without making them look like spider legs! The only complaint is it takes awhile for the mascara to dry and can easily smudge if it hasn‚Äôt set yet. It lasts all day once it dries and easily washes off! Overall I am very very pleased with this mascara!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Awesome sauce,Jeneel,3 Oct 2020,This mascara is very black which i like and its has a flat side which you can use to coat your lashes and then the brush sides which you use to comb your lashes through and to push it up. Its definitely works for me I love it and the package is everything.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing!!,Diana0413,3 Oct 2020,I get SO many compliments every time I use this mascara! It makes my eyelashes look super long and thick all while holding a perfect curl. It is also super easy to apply and not too difficult to take off before bed! I really recommend this mascara!!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,DZZZZZZ,3 Oct 2020,"Received this complimentary from influenster. Love the volume this product imparts, but the price point is too high for me.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,raboelter20,3 Oct 2020,This mascara was alright. It is heavy and made my eyelashes droop. I don‚Äôt love the finished look of my lashes. Brush is not something I normally look for in mascara. I received this product for free from Influenster.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,lizzya6,2 Oct 2020,"I actually LOVE this mascara. over the past few years my eyes have become more sensitive so they tend to water easily, and this mascara never makes them water. It did take a few tries to get a technique down with this brush and the formula, but I absolutely love it. I find that I need to apply at least 3 coats to get to my liking, but I love that it's buildable and simple to really separate the lashes. It is for sure more effort than other mascaras, but I love the final look and gentle formula. Minus one star because I wish it gave more volume and not just length.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Galiba,2 Oct 2020,"Lovvvveeee this! I used to be obsessed with Estee Lauder sumptuous infinite, which they don't sell anymore and have been on the hunt for a replacement ever since. The brush is definitley different than the Estee Lauder, but the outcome is the same. Falsie like lashes, buildable, doesnt flake, stays put and comes off easily with makeup remover. No panda eyes before bed! Yay! Love this mascara!!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,sammycaillesp,1 Oct 2020,I really enjoyed this mascara because of how nice it applied. It definitely did its job in lengthening and adding volume to my lashes which I love.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Length!!,laurenpascoe5,1 Oct 2020,I absolutely loved this product! I could not be happier with the lengthening of the lashes as well as the applicator which helps to separate the lashes out! It was perfect and I‚Äôll be buying again,Tilbury,Mascara,No
really volumizing,alannarhodes,1 Oct 2020,"Personally, I prefer a brush applicator but this is the first plastic applicator that actually gave my lashes volume!! I really like the apllicator design that you can comb through your lashes but also use the flatter side to really coat your lashes. I also find the applicator tip helpful for the inner and outer corners. The mascara formula is a nice consistency not too wet or dry, and layers really well on itself and other mascaras or primers without clumping.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,cnryd,1 Oct 2020,Flakecity! Drugstore has better mascara. Not long wearing at all. Did an overall average job on volume and length. So disappointed,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best Curling Mascara Evah!,jogger,1 Oct 2020,"New Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes Mascara excels at curling my straight lashes and keeping them that way till I remove the mascara. It's genius that way! Also, if you like the blackest possible black mascara, you'll love this one called Super Black. However with my downturned eyes and wonky lashes, I am struggling with the rather unusual wand. Every time I get a clump of mascara on my outer lashes that I have to remove either with the wand or with a lash comb. Nevertheless, the wet formula is good for layering, and it is both volumizing and lengthening. Plus, the luxe packaging is gorgeous.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
loved it!!,monicasul,1 Oct 2020,I received  this mascara complementary for testing purposes and instantly LOVED it!! I'm so happy it was sent to me because I don't know if I would have found it otherwise! It's a great mascara and very versatile for creating natural and dramatic lash effects. be careful which direction the wand is facing for the correct effect on lashes!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Game Changer,Liz0630,30 Sep 2020,"Let me first start off by saying, I am a bristle kind of girl. The bigger the better, take my lashes to the stars, please and thank you. Every time I get a mascara with a comb applicator my eyelashes look like tarantula legs. If that is your esthetic, you go girl, I can‚Äôt pull it off. However, this is a game changer for sure. It did take some user error before I got the hang of it but after that it was easy to apply.
The formula is great. It sets and holds nicely throughout the day. I have rubbed my eye and did not have transfer unless they were wet but this isn‚Äôt a waterproof mascara so that is to be expected. The formula does not bother my eyes either, very creamy.
Definitely worth the money and will be purchasing in the future.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Worth it!,mkpunk,30 Sep 2020,"I love this mascara! Goes on super smooth, no clumps. Stays on all day long and doesn‚Äôt start to smear. Leaves lashes nice and full.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
No clumps and lasts all day!,JulezVerne,30 Sep 2020,I am absolutely in love with this Mascara I got it in a VOXBOX and will definitely be purchasing it! I dont even have to tell my friends I got new Mascara they notice and comment on it! This is a new permanent jewel in my makeup bag! Perfect curls everytime and its not clumpy plus lasts all day and night!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love this mascara!,Aubrey29xoxo,30 Sep 2020,I absolutely loved this mascara! It made my lashes look super long and went on nicely! I received so many compliments! A little bit goes a long way and wasn‚Äôt goopy or anything. This is my new favorite mascara. I highly recommend it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
One of my favorite,SangerV,30 Sep 2020,"This is one of my favorite mascaras. The reason why it isn‚Äôt my favorite one is because I like my lashes really long and this one is kind of a volume mascara. So if you‚Äôre looking for that volume, go with this one.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
perfect but... terrible for bottom lashes,vesperteene,30 Sep 2020,"First off this products packaging was luxurious it really reminded me of her lipsticks and how much I love the gold and weight of them, it just feels expensive. The applicator is so interesting because it‚Äôs not completing round it‚Äôs more flat and has bristles on two sides I still make the motion of twirling the applicator to get fuller and curlier lashes. I‚Äôve worn this for the past 3 weeks and can tell that it‚Äôs become one of my favorite mascaras. The only problem I had with it is that they‚Äôre horrible for bottom lashes they ended up smearing at the end of the day and I had black eye bags which I really didn‚Äôt like. It didn‚Äôt flake it was mostly just smudging. But overall if you‚Äôre looking for a mascara that gives you everything and you don‚Äôt wear mascara on your bottom lashes this is it!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great one!,ThaisMaya,30 Sep 2020,"This mascara is really good! My natural lashes aren't super long though, so we couldn't really see much difference as shown in the pics; however it is certainly a great high end product and I'm sure that would work best for longer lashes. I wore it for long hours and it only transferred a bit to my upper eye area (but not much at all). I'm actually happy with it and I'd buy it again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Lengthening,kgray7,30 Sep 2020,"I received this complimentary from Influenster. I really like that it lengthens your lashes I was hoping for a little more volume, but still works very well. The applicator is very easy to use.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Influenster review,jdreher13,30 Sep 2020,I got this product for free in my Influenster box. I like it but im not a huge fan of the brush I felt it make my eyelashes clump together.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Not too thin, not too thick!",cherayyy,30 Sep 2020,I loved this product! Not too thin. Not too thick and it didn‚Äôt clump either!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great glam for short lashes.,cookievalentine,30 Sep 2020,"I have been looking forward to trying this product since I first heard about it and I am here to say it was worth the wait. I have really short and coarse lashes and the formula of this product really helps give me some length and volume. The con for me in the wand, I don't know if it's because it is very different than your average mascara applicator but for me the flat edges make it a little more difficult to grab my little lashes. Overall I love this product, maybe I just need to work with the wand a little bit more.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Yessss!!,carreri,30 Sep 2020,"Honestly, this is one of the best mascaras I have ever used ! Like wow this made my eyes pop. Definitely recommend!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,lkovach29,30 Sep 2020,I bought this stuff because of the reviews also I have a hard time finding a mascara that actually makes my lashes long I love this stuff so much I bought another one very happy and pleased only down fault is I don't like how much Mascara on the brush I got take some off to get a good look the brush really hard to get used to but Id totally recommended this to everyone,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Full Beautiful Lashes,fitgirl8,29 Sep 2020,Winner!  Finally a product that does what it claims to do. I‚Äôm in my mid 50‚Äôs and want my lashes to be seen. This mascara definitely pushed them up and made them look fuller. I‚Äôm very happy with the results after one try!  Definitely recommend for any and all lashes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great mascara!,reviewer44,29 Sep 2020,I‚Äôm loving this mascara. Makes my last so long and adds a lot of volume. My lashes arent clumpy or flakey by the end of the day.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Smanjilina,29 Sep 2020,"Love the duo wand, defining and lengthening my lashes. I‚Äôm not one to wear flash lashes so this helps to bring mine to life. I really enjoy using this mascara. The packaging is simple but don‚Äôt let that fool you, this wand has power!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Obsessed!,bethrrussell,28 Sep 2020,"I am so in love with this mascara! My lashes are thin and basically see through. This mascara gives them amazing length and volume. I've literally never been happier with a mascara. 

*I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Interesting, but great",CrissaKidd,28 Sep 2020,"This new style mascara is quite interesting. The brush took a little to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes your new favorite. The actual mascara is dark and not too thick. Very easy to get a smooth finish across. It last a very long time looking PERFECT. Only down sides to this product is that it is not waterproof, which smudges easily. Also, it‚Äôs a bit difficult to remove! Remanentes stay behind and cause for a smudgey eye if not fully removed. But great for going out or even everyday use. New fav",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best mascara,nricottone24,27 Sep 2020,Amazing product! This product makes my lashes so long and it really volumizes them. I enjoy using this product because it lasts a long time and i know my lashes are going to stay amazing all day long.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,jen101,27 Sep 2020,Performs just like the claims state...couldn‚Äôt be happier!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,saraleone,26 Sep 2020,This mascara is amazing. It lasts long time I wore it today and it lasted about 7 to 8 hours and still looked amazing. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the brush it‚Äôs not my fav but I would recommend totally !!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Exceptional,charlieman1,26 Sep 2020,It‚Äôs a 10! Seriously I am so surprised how well this mascara works. I have NEVER used a mascara that worked liked this. Immediately my lashes grew in size! I got compliments all day.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Fuller Lashes,IsabellSaldana,26 Sep 2020,"Great mascara, made my eyelashes look fuller and longer. The way the brush is made is nice. The only down side to this product is the way it clumps very easily. Other than that if you want longer fuller lashes this is it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,SarongGirl,26 Sep 2020,I really wanted to love this product cos the pictures looked so pretty but I found the brush quite hard to use to apply mascara carefully without getting it clumpy. I find drugstore brands do a better job and at half the price. The packaging is cute though although I won‚Äôt be purchasing this again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Overhyped,Megan9524,26 Sep 2020,"This isn't necessarily a bad product, but it feels like an expensive version of lash blast. The formula is very thick and heavy, and while it defines and darkens really nicely, it doesn't give me the volume and length im looking for. I expected more.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Eh. It‚Äôs okay.,LoeAshleyy,26 Sep 2020,Mascara did not meet my expectation. It made my lashes clump together and did not appear to lengthen them.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Dark undereye transfer,red639,26 Sep 2020,"This mascara transfers under my eye. Leaving dark shadows. Ick. I've tried baking, applying less, looking forward for a long time to ensure it's dry. Nothing works. I end up with dark transfer EVERY time. I have never written a review on Sephora but I'm just so disappointed to spend this much on a mascara (after reading so many good reviews) and have to throw something away. Maybe it's just my chemistry/bad luck but I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
awesome,dml79ro,25 Sep 2020,"Great Mascara, volume and length, even with one coat, slight flaking at the end of the day, but not an issue",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Wonderful mascara!,valber11,25 Sep 2020,I like everything about it. Especially a brush that makes my lashes two times longer! You can wear this mascara all day without grey circles around your eyes in the evening.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Super black and volume,rosesanddessert,25 Sep 2020,This mascara is pretty amazing not only does it lift but it volume my tiny eyelashes! It‚Äôs really black which I love so much I would definitely be buying after I run outback,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love this mascara!!,athenarip,25 Sep 2020,I really enjoyed this mascara. My lashes stayed voluminous and long all day with no fall out. The packaging is so cute and the wand head was super easy to use. I also really liked how it was a super pitch black color. Natural for the day or glamorous for night.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
It‚Äôs amazing,yaramis,25 Sep 2020,It is amazing!!!!!! This mascara was sent to me to try but am am not kidding when I say I will continue to buy this mascara. I was a huge fan of the Chanel mascara but this one is just as good and somewhat cheaper. It has like a a part to lengthen it and one to add more product to add volume literally best of both worlds!!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best a couple days after opening,beckyyyyyyyyy,25 Sep 2020,"When I first started using this mascara I didn‚Äôt think it was super impressive. However as I continued using it, I realized it got better and better. It curled & held the curl, it didn‚Äôt transfer, it didn‚Äôt flake, and wasn‚Äôt super hard to remove at the end of the day. The wand takes a couple days to adjust to but is easy to get the hang of. If you‚Äôre in the market for a high end mascara, I would definitely recommend.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,giulianna99,24 Sep 2020,"my only issue with this mascara is the brush can be difficult to use at first. since it is not a common brush, i had to learn how to layer the product, but once i did my lashes looked amazing! it gives great volume AND length at the same time. i like that it dries down and doesn't flake onto my face because that is common for me. overall awesome, but the brush could be a little more user friendly :-)",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Full lashes, yes!",shoppingqueen11,24 Sep 2020,This is some pretty great stuff. It makes your lashes so full and makes yours POP! I did receive this to try for free but let me tell you I will be purchasing another bottle when I‚Äôm out.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
save your money,chelle0831,24 Sep 2020,"This is such a poorly made mascara. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this, there are so many better options. It is so thick and wet that it just sits on top of the lashes and transfers above and below the eye. It looks like I swept tar across my lashes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Cute Mascara,haileyc7,24 Sep 2020,"I thought this was a really cute product. The packaging feels really nice and has very feminine colors. I like the concept of the wand, but I would use the long side only. The build-up side doesn't actually build into your lashes. It produces a very soft and lengthening look. I would buy this again!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Absolutely awful!,ctina16,24 Sep 2020,"This mascara was Absolutely awful after the second use! The brush is far too long and the tube does not control the amount that should go on the brush; making it filled with product that is hard to remove and adjust to the right amount of application. It also advertises that it is 24hr wear without running, and within several hours of wear, I had mascara running down my cheeks.

 As for product removal, I use the cle de peau eye makeup removal wipes and that got the job done fairly well, but you still need to get a great face wash that will remove the rest. Honestly, I was hoping I could have a new, fun mascara but I am sticking with the gold of Kevin Aucoin curling mascara. Going on 12 years strong with this brand and it has yet to let me down.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Madisynnb,24 Sep 2020,This is my new favorite mascara. I see so much length when i use it!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Black bottom eyelids,jazziea,23 Sep 2020,"This mascara was okay. I typically only wear mascara on my bottom lashes since I have lash extensions... only problem is that my bottom eyelids turned black shortly after putting on the mascara. I do believe it gives the lashes a fuller look, but I don‚Äôt like how my lids turned black.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,rebekahshadow,23 Sep 2020,I loved this mascara! My eyelashes looked great. The mascara lasted all day.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love the double sided brush,sochee,23 Sep 2020,I love the double sided brush and how dark it was on my lashes. The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like was that it started to rub off under my lower lashes.. i do love that fact that it didn‚Äôt make my lashes look like spider legs,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Nice product!,mlcr2019,23 Sep 2020,Great mascara! Last long and gives off good color! Not crazy about the applicator but it‚Äôs something I can get over!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Beautiful, natural look",jwinders,23 Sep 2020,"This mascara is a good layering mascara for me. I wear A LOT of mascara each day. I usually use this on top of another brand. If you don‚Äôt like to wear lots of mascara, I‚Äôd recommend this for a more natural look. The brush allows for good definition and you can layer it on for volume.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
LOVED IT,Claudia199821,23 Sep 2020,I loved this mascara. I already have a full lashes but with this mascara it looks more full and long. I received this mascara from Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster. So thank you very much for the gift and I really love it. And I‚Äôm definitely recommend this product to everyone. I don‚Äôt usually wear makeup but I cannot live without mascara.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
A MUST HAVE,jmichelleo,23 Sep 2020,"This is currently one of my fave mascaras! My natural lashes are extremely short, and this formula + brush combination is PERFECT. The brush is definitely unique, having 2 flat sides to apply product and 2 sides with bristles to smooth out the product. I went to Disney World on a rainy, humid day with this mascara and it didn‚Äôt smear or flake off. The only thing I‚Äôd recommend is if you buy this, definitely but an oil-based makeup remover.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"great formula, terrible applicator",ProductLover123,23 Sep 2020,"Love the formula itself- it doesn‚Äôt flake or smudge, wears strongly all day, and holds the curl, length and volume all day. The applicator is the problem and the reason for the low star review (I actually returned it because of this). The brush has a completely flat side to add the mascara to your lashes then a comb side to comb it through. The flat side adds product very inconsistently, leaving you with some areas of too much so then when you try to come through some lashes are fab while others have too much product and get clumpy. If they changed their brush to a simple brush for putting on the product then keep the comb for the comb through part of the process, then I‚Äôd love it and want to make it my #1 mascara. I tried it for over a week and kept trying to change my application techniques but just couldn‚Äôt make it work with the brush. Bummer!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Its cute,DesiB7,23 Sep 2020,I like this mascara just you have to get used to the applicator. Its two sided where one side separates and the other lengthens and defines. The product itself is nice. It holds up throughout my 8 hr shift. If i dont use setting spray it flakes on me bc i tend to sweat alot. Overall love the packaging and product.recieved complementary from influencer.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Charlotte does it again!,here4themakeup,23 Sep 2020,"Love love love this mascara! Great formula- non clumpy. Also love the ‚Äútwo sided‚Äù brush! One ‚Äúside‚Äù of the brush adds volume and thickness, the other ‚Äúside‚Äù separates and defines. The packaging is also super cute. I‚Äôm a big fan of Benefit‚Äôs Roller Lash- this one is very similar (maybe better?)",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,anderson91,23 Sep 2020,"If you are looking for thick, long full lashes that last all day this mascara is for you!! I have never been more pleased with a mascara in my life.

not long lasting,annara2024,23 Sep 2020,it‚Äôs not long lasting as it portrays. I work 8 hours and have often found in the middle of my shift that i have black mascara marks under my eyebrows. It starts to rub off on my skin where my eyelashes touch my brow bone.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,sarahannnn,23 Sep 2020,"While there is a learning curve to this mascara, the end results are worth it! I really love the lengthening effect this gives! Giving it a 4 star though because I doubt I‚Äôd repurchase just because the application takes time and precision. Still a great product though, if you can get used to it!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Im shocked,KayWlovesMakeup,23 Sep 2020,I received this mascara complimentary from Influenster and I thought it would be mediocre at best. I am VERY picky when it comes to mascara. There are MANY I‚Äôve tried that people have raved about that I absolutely hated. This mascara had me shook. I couldn‚Äôt believe that it actually worked. It made my lashes look full and completed my look without having to add falsies. I actually purchased another because I was so happy with it. I highly recommend this mascara especially if you‚Äôre picky like me. For how good it is you cannot beat the price point either.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Worth the price!,millcitycat,23 Sep 2020,"It paints my lashes nicely, doesn‚Äôt flake, doesn‚Äôt clump and doesn‚Äôt weigh down my lashes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
So much volume!!,danashark,23 Sep 2020,I absolutely love this mascara. My eyelashes have never looked so great. This formula was not goooy like others I have tried in the past. My eyelashes had so much volume and it stayed put all day. I received it complimentary from Influenster for a review.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,vlm20,23 Sep 2020,Not a fan. The brush is terrible in my opinion. It makes the mascara application very thick which makes your eyes heavy. The color and staying power is great. Not worth the money.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Great Mascara for me,PhoebePDX,22 Sep 2020,"I like this product. I like the wand and how it applies. I usually have problems finding a good mascara because I have sensitive eyes. However, I find that this product doesn‚Äôt irritate my eyes throughout the day. It‚Äôs also easy to remove at night. I am knocking off a star because of the price. If I didn‚Äôt receive it as a sample I‚Äôm not sure I would have gotten it based on the price.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Fantastic mascara for long lashes,rlharris92,22 Sep 2020,"Don‚Äôt let this little bottle deceive you ‚Äî a little bit of product goes a long way. The wand is uniquely shaped with a dual-sided, tapered flat end to apply product all the way to the base of your lashes, and  edged length-wise with bristles to spread the mascara evenly up the length of your lashes. No clumping to speak of (I‚Äôm looking at you Better than Sex mascara) and it dries fairly quickly IMO. This is one of the few mascaras I‚Äôve tried that is truly water- and sweat-proof but also is a breeze to remove with face wash. If you‚Äôre in the market for new mascara and not happy with your current lash game, give this one a try.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,clairelouiseg,22 Sep 2020,"Some background info on myself: I‚Äôm Asian and have decently long eyelashes but they are pin straight. I have to say I am loving this product. I love the extra volume and length this mascara gives me after curling my lashes. It separates well, which is a must since I hate clumpy stuck together lashes. It‚Äôs easily build able, as I like to put multiple coats on to give my lashes a pop. One thing I‚Äôd say is that formula can tend to be a bit smudgy but to fix that, I usually put a thin coat of a waterproof mascara over it which works for me.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

I love this mascara.,IoSoprano,21 Sep 2020,"I love this mascara. I'm very picky about mascaras. I like something that lengthens without giving me spider lashes or making my lashes crunchy. This amazing mascara does just that. My lashes actually feel conditioned after I use it, and it doesn't flake, run, or irritate my sensitive eyes. I also, REALLY love the unique brush that comes with it. I received this mascara as part of a vox box via influenster.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
NOT for every type of lashes,Vivianation,21 Sep 2020,"I love CT‚Äôs products. I owned a few.

Amazing!,JustShellyoffic,21 Sep 2020,I absolutely love this mascara! It really helpsnyhe natural lashes to stand out and perfect for an everyday day look when you don't wanna wear falsies!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
great for volume and lengthening !,Robs98,21 Sep 2020,"I got this as a free product from Influenster to review. I was SO excited to try anything from Charlotte Tilbury as I have many of her products and love them! This was no exception. One side of the brush is flat and hold the product which you wiggle onto the base of your lashes. Then, with the brush side, evenly distributed all the way up to the tips. I held it there for a few seconds for extra lift. I really liked the volume and length I got from this brush and the formula is a really nice consistency. I found it last all day as well and came off easily with soap and water. The tube seems larger than other mascaras I‚Äôve purchased so it seems to be a lot of product for the buck! I would definitely recommend this!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Is this a Holy Grail?!,Amarie1384,21 Sep 2020,"I received this product complementary for review. Could this be my new HolyGrail mascara, I think it might! This super black double sided brush allows you to lift lashes on one side and create volume on the other side. It does not clump or crumble and only takes 2 coats at most for my desired finish. I am overly satisfied.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best mascara that this mascara junkie has ever use,jennifer98101,21 Sep 2020,"This mascara might be the best one I‚Äôve ever used. There‚Äôs a tiny bit of a learning curve - the brush is basically flat on two sides and then bristled on the two other sides. I curl my lashes first (a must for me), and then I press the flat side of the brush up against them, basically pushing the lashes up. This applies the mascara to all the lashes without uncurling them. Then, immediately after, I twist the brush and use the bristled side to gently comb them from root to tip. I use the tip of the brush to fan out the outer and inner corners. The result is pretty incredible after just one coat, but because I used to be a lash extensions junkie, I‚Äôll apply a second coat, and sometimes a third if I‚Äôm feeling like I want the drama. What‚Äôs amazing to me is how buildable this mascara is. There is zero clumping, and because the tiny bristles keep all the lashes coated but separated, my lashes look insanely long, thick, and DENSE. For the bottom lashes, I just the use the bristle side and coat from root to tip, and this will tightline for you as well. I notice a tiny bit of smudging towards the end of a long day, but they stay perfectly curled, no drooping. Also, this mascara is very very black and matte, and the lashes feel soft, even after three coats. A huge win.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
It‚Äôs alright,meggs96,21 Sep 2020,This mascara is great. It‚Äôs just not for me! I don‚Äôt have a lot of patience when it comes to make up and with this wand you need patience. If you don‚Äôt turn the wand the exact way it should be turned you end up with big mascara clumps. Not cute. And I poked myself in the eye with it. Not saying this wouldn‚Äôt work for you. The formula is super nice. It‚Äôs just not for everyone.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love,magpie12,21 Sep 2020,I really like this mascara! It separates and gives so much volume to my stubby lashes! Highly recommend. I got to test this product out complementary of Influenster,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Mascara all day everyday,abbywojo,21 Sep 2020,"I use mascara daily and will often only wear mascara. I have tried so so many mascaras and have my few that are go tos but I was more than excited to try this one! I should start off with this, this mascara is beautiful. The packaging is beautiful and when it goes on well, it makes your lashes absolutely gorgeous. However let me say, the brush is not for everyone. I literally apply mascara every single day and have never poked myself in the eye with the wand. More than once with this mascara, I have. I am concentrating so hard on the way the brush is turned that I get too close and brush my eye with the wand. If you do not have the wand turned perfectly, it produces big lumps of mascara on your lashes. I don‚Äôt want to say I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this mascara but all I am saying is, I‚Äôm not clumsy and I struggled with this (lol). I received this mascara complimentary for this review.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Perfect volume,blanca94,20 Sep 2020,"Thia product gives the perfect volume thats lasts all day, i love how you dont have to apply many coats for it to actually work and feels light weight",Tilbury,Mascara,No
100% recommend this product,Madidaydreamer,20 Sep 2020,This product works SO WELL! It makes my lashes SUPER LONG AND THICK without looking clumpy or spidery! I love it!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great!,michellez8,20 Sep 2020,"This brand has really surprised me with how expensive their products look! I think it is worth it for the price, the brush works so well for bottom lashes and also really great for my top lashes! My lashes aren‚Äôt really long, so it really helps me get to the eyelashes on the ends. The brush is very tiny but it grabs eyelashes very well",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,allison220,20 Sep 2020,The color of this mascara was a great true black. I didn‚Äôt love the shape of the brush I felt like it applied the mascara but didn‚Äôt do well to blend it in and lengthen the lashes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Loving it,Caronicole,20 Sep 2020,Lobe this product! The shade is amazing. It‚Äôs perfect for volume and length.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
I so wanted to love it!,Aussiecoco,20 Sep 2020,"I really wanted to love this mascara and thought it was fianlly going to be the holy grail of mascaras - but alas, it was not. Doesn't add any extra volume to my lashes and a few hours after application it's smudging onto the area under my eye. The search continues!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Average product,skincarewiz,20 Sep 2020,"This is the strangest mascara I ever tried
You have to put a lot of effort to apply it. I tried many other mascaras and some of them are much better and easier to apply.  I did not like the product and I'm returning this.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best Mascara,Zee18,20 Sep 2020,Im in love with this mascara! I received this complimentary from influenster. It gives your lashes volume and length. Completely obsessed with it. Look at my pictures before and after.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,marlas,20 Sep 2020,This is a great mascara for length and volume.  The brush can be used in many different ways.  This may be the best new mascara out there.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudges and Smears,val87,20 Sep 2020,"I used as directed, and at first I really liked the curl and length, but towards the end of the day I had smudging and smearing - granted that I had been indoors too. I have moderately dry skin, so it did not as advertised for me.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Great lengthening mascara,Jessarooney,20 Sep 2020,I am usually a 3/4 coat mascara user especially for a dark extreme look.  The Pillow Talk did an amazing job on lengthening and without any clumping at all.  It went on really smooth and the wand is really easy to use and has a great comb effect to minimize your lashes sticking together.  This is a great everyday mascara and a nice price point.  Highly recommend!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,KAB87,20 Sep 2020,"This mascara OMG. I recently had bought mascara claiming to do the same thing this does from  another big company. This puts that one to shame!  I‚Äôm in love with this mascara. It goes on so smooth no clumps, great applicator. This lasted all day I‚Äôm talking 8am to like 11pm without flaking or giving me raccoon eyes. All day long it kept that just applied look. It lifted, separated, and gave volume to my lashes. I will continue to buy this when it‚Äôs time for a restock.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Nice high end mascara!,Mandyleigh89,20 Sep 2020,"I like this mascara, but it takes a few tries to get the desired results! You use the flat end to add volume and color along the lash line, then the bristled end to add length and fan out your lashes. It takes a bit of practice! But the end result is nice. It‚Äôs not clumpy and the formula is great. Lasts all day without being too difficult to remove. Would compare the results to roller lash - but perhaps better! Roller lash takes a ton of coats where as this I do 3-4 and get it where I like.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Meganmorg,20 Sep 2020,"I received this complementary in exchange for my honest review. This mascara is my new holy grail!!! Love the brush and the formula! Not clump at all, I totally recommend this.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,W1986,19 Sep 2020,"I‚Äôm slightly on the fence about this mascara. I love the wand and the volume it gives my lashes but it takes a few coats for me to get my lashes the way I like them. I‚Äôve only used it a few times but it doesn‚Äôt add the length I was hoping for. Overall, though, this is a good mascara that I will continue to use.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,zoe7897,19 Sep 2020,Looks nice upon initial application but flakes and smudges within 2-3 hours of wear. Absolutely not worth the price.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great!,SamanthaS5,19 Sep 2020,I LOVE THIS MASCARA I haven‚Äôt found a mascara I really like in awhile. The applicator on it just makes so much sense and it really lifts my lashes! I highly recommend trying it,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,nbartoschbeauty,19 Sep 2020,This mascara is FANTASTIC! It lengthens and separates every lash. It gives the falsie effect without the falsies. Its also not flaky or clumpy.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Finally mascara that doesn‚Äôt burn!,ReadingLashes,18 Sep 2020,"Most mascara makes my eyes burn and turn red. This one, amazingly, did not! It‚Äôs pretty, and definitely adds both volume and length. I‚Äôll be buying it again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
I like it.,Lyss1231,18 Sep 2020,I actually really enjoy this mascara. It‚Äôs not a necessity but it is worth a splurge for a higher end mascara.  It stays in place and looks naturally pretty.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Amcc93,18 Sep 2020,This is such a great product! I love the brush and how it makes my lashes look fuller and longer! Definitely recommend making it your new go to mascara.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Sadly, not worth it.",StarWhale75,18 Sep 2020,I really was excited about this product as I really love her brow gel. It‚Äôs super goopy and I‚Äôm constantly poking my eyes out with it and getting it all over my eyelid because the wand head is weird. I did notice a little flaking as well and smudges really easy. It‚Äôs totally not worth it but the packaging is beautiful.  It basically checks off all the boxes of things you don‚Äôt want in a mascara.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
LOVE THIS!!,Rachael1212,18 Sep 2020,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èstop scrolling and read! Okay, now that I have your attention let me tell you how amazing this mascara is! It does wonders for length and lift! The brush is so different too. Your supposed to use the flat side to apply the product then use the other side to zigzag through the lashes. I had no clumps either! I won‚Äôt be going back to my other mascar after using this!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,ssnico,18 Sep 2020,This mascara is awesome. It's smooth and not clumpy or dry. I would highly reccomend it to anyone looking for those thick lashes without them looking dry and crusty. This mascara is a great color and consistency.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Presidentniki,18 Sep 2020,LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara. The first time I used it was amazing! Love at first sight. I got it from Influenster and it‚Äôs all the rave. Perfect for everyday wear or layer it for a dramatic look . 10/10,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Basicbrunette,18 Sep 2020,"This mascara worked really well, but wasn‚Äôt anything new or ground breaking. It did a really good job of lengthening my lashes, but it did not seem to help them hold a curl very well. It also seemed like it took forever for the formula to dry after it was applied. The packaging is super cute and it was a pretty good overall mascara, but not my favorite of all time. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Sadly not a fan!,nattiejanee,18 Sep 2020,"When I received this item, I had high hopes for it! I thought it would give my lashes the perfect lift/volume but sadly that was not the case. The bristles held a lot of product which then made it very goopy on the eye. I tried it multiple times with the same result.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
THE BEST !!!!!!!!!!!!,BMS86,18 Sep 2020,It‚Äôs literally the best mascara I‚Äôve ever used after you put it on with your make up it looks like you have false eyelashes on !!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Yas,kamel12,18 Sep 2020,"So first - the packaging - is gorgeous. Absolutely felt like that bich when I received the mascara in its box. And THEN, I pulled it out of the box and was instantly upgraded to queen status. I even said to my boy toy - I‚Äôm a rich bich now baby. As for the application, I was a bit skeptical about how the dual sided wand would go. One side being completely flat? Outlandish. However, after I read how to properly apply the mascara and use the brush to the fullest potential - I loved it. It‚Äôs actually so smart to have a side where I can load the mascara and place at the base of my lashes and then have the fine bristles to disperse it onto my lashes. It applied smoothly, evenly, and without clumps (I‚Äôm looking at you IT Superhero). And yes, my lashes have more volume and length than ever before.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
My new go to!,kateycakes30,18 Sep 2020,I really enjoyed this mascara. I normally don‚Äôt try new mascaras because we all have our tried and true favorites but this may be my new go to! The brush is innovative and helps you load mascara onto the eyelashes and the sides help you separate the lashes for definition. The only downside is sometimes too much product is on the applicator and can make clumps.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Fantastic Mascara for Fine Lashes,wahlflower,17 Sep 2020,"Fantastic! The more I use CT products the more I love the brand and the mascara is no exception. I have such fine eyelashes and have a hard time finding mascara that I like. When I opened the mascara I knew right away I was going to like the applicator. Because my eyelashes are thin the applicator plays a huge role for me. 

Once I started to apply it, I was in love because there was no clumping. It was smooth and went on so even. It‚Äôs easy to build on, which is a plus. Also, the pink packaging amazing. Let‚Äôs just all the CT packaging is amazing.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Shaunicy,17 Sep 2020,"This product really made my eyelashes stand out nd the wand made it easy to get all the corners and bottom lashes in a breeze, the only thing I didn't like was that it isn't waterproof at all. Overall great product with really awesome and heavy duty packaging! i got this for free via influenster",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,4theluvofskin,17 Sep 2020,"I REALLY, really wanted to love this mascara. Love the wand but it flaked terribly by midday. Super disappointed about this",Tilbury,Mascara,No
meh,smokyeyes,17 Sep 2020,"I don‚Äôt like this. It‚Äôs nothing special. I did five coats and then recurled my lashes and it still didn‚Äôt look great. After applying, I had a few times where it felt like something was in my eyes that was very irritating. I only had it on one eye and that eye was irritated. There are better mascaras out here.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing!!,laurenjessie,17 Sep 2020,"I have really straight lashes and usually have to wear waterproof mascara to keep a curl, but this held the curl all day! The want is so unique and makes it perfect to separate lashes while curling and lengthening them! New holy grail!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Did Not Curl my Straight Lashes,kamisunflower,17 Sep 2020,"This mascara did not meet my expectations. I have long lashes that are straight and don't hold a curl.  I expected curly and possibly fluffy lashes, but I got neither.  The shape of the brush makes it so that too much product is held in the flat side.  This in turn, makes the lashes clumpy and the product runs over to the lids (I had to re-do my eyeshadow).  I wore the mascara throughout the day in hot weather, with a mask on, and the mascara gave me raccoon eyes.  Although you do get some length, you can get the same or a better effect from a Loreal or Maybelline mascara.  I love other Charlotte Tilbury products, but I could not get this mascara to work for me.  I returned the product.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Really Nice but smudges easily,Alkalai,17 Sep 2020,"Really Nice but smudges easily. It really does make my lashes appear much longer, and thankfully without the clumpiness that some mascaras do. I have yet to see if its waterproof but after putting it on my bottom lashes it did smudge a few minutes after (probably my fault though, I think I sneezed or something lol). It is a new fave of mine though.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,vsachs,17 Sep 2020,Love this mascara so far! Great for length and comes off pretty easily. The dual sided wand is maybe a little confusing but a cool feature too. Would recommend and consider it similar to Benefit They‚Äôre Real in terms of results!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing for length and volume!,sambanavong,17 Sep 2020,"This mascara is great for doing both volume and length! It‚Äôs usually hard to find these types of mascaras, so if you‚Äôre on the look for a two-in-one, this is it! When I first applied it, it was giving me more length but once I layered it up it also gave me volume. And it looks amazing, as if I‚Äôm wearing falsies! Highly recommend for everyone to try it out",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,meganlynn07,17 Sep 2020,AMAZING it lifted my lashes so much and made them look so long. I got an all day wear out of it and people even asked if I had extensions. The only think I didn‚Äôt like is it was hard to get it all off at the end of the day. But hey that‚Äôs what makes a good product.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,jazlynn246,17 Sep 2020,I love love love this mascara. It lasted all day for me and there was no fall out or crumbling. I like how much it lifted my lashes it made them super long.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

My new favorite mascara!,fernandachaves,16 Sep 2020,"I‚Äôm very impressed by the formula of this mascara, the wand works perfectly to give my lashes volume and length. I wore it all day and it didn‚Äôt smudge at all. I‚Äôve been wearing everyday since and I can confidently say that I found my new favorite mascara. If you want crazy volume and a long lasting eye look, I would definitely recommend it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,mandaaaaa,16 Sep 2020,"I really loved the definition and lift this mascara gave my lashes. Not only is this packaging really feminine and adorable, but it executed very well on my thin lashes. It took many layers to get the volume I wanted, but the definition was fantastic from the getgo. No running or smudging either after a night of sangria and snacks. Overall I was really impressed with this mascara!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Wow!,concealcait,16 Sep 2020,"I am a ride and die Tarte Maneater fan, but this mascara has changed my life. The applicator is very unique where you have the flat end giving you a good amount of product and as you continue to twirl your wand the bristles lift, separate and volumize your lashes. Truly amazing results. I received this product through a Vox Box and am already adding it to my cart to purchase for myself. Love it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,ELF11,16 Sep 2020,I didn‚Äôt care for this mascara. It made my lashes really long but the brush made them clump together. I did not like the brush. I received this mascara from Influenster to test.,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Oh my lashes!,kaspell,16 Sep 2020,"Honestly, I love this product! The packaging, beautifully done. The way it feels while holding it makes a girl feel excited to use! The application part, I love that you have dual sides to choose from. The bristles give the option to load on then comb through for length. I honestly prefer wearing my mascara lighter but this formula gives you any volume you desire! I definitely recommend this product!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love!,mirandao,16 Sep 2020,"Great formula!! It stays on all day, it did take me a second to figure out the applicator. No clumping whatsoever.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Ninakoko,16 Sep 2020,I am quite impressed with this mascara when I saw the wand I was a little put off because most of the time when wands like that they don‚Äôt work well on my lashes. But this gave me a good length after 2 coats and I have pretty stubby lashes.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,cmays13,16 Sep 2020,Absolutely love this mascara! Have my lashes the lift and length needed.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Horrible!!,natalienoelle,16 Sep 2020,"This is THE worst mascara. I hope I can return. It smudged all on its own, it made my lashes fall flat and it was expensive!! I can't believe she put her name on this horrible product!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Really nice,SouthernVanity,16 Sep 2020,I really like this mascara! It made my sparse lashes look full and long. Didnt flake at all and lasted all day! Definitely a great product! *I received this product complimentary for my honest review*,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Patthom,16 Sep 2020,Really good mascara. It is actually one of my favorites. It doesn't clump up like better than sex and it added length to my lashes. I recommend it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,melaniezimmer,16 Sep 2020,"Absolutely love the packaging of this mascara. In regards to how it performs, it definitely does a great job with keeping your lashes separated, full, and volumized. I even think it gave my lashes a good bit of length as well. The only thing i noticed was that it flakes after wearing for an extended period of time which is very annoying.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
YAAAAASS Queen Status,IgnormyNot,16 Sep 2020,"WOW. This is my new favorite mascara, It does exactly what it says, my lashes went from just there to having madd Volume and Definition.

For self curling lashes only,narfikins,16 Sep 2020,"really wanted this to work for me. I will have to say my lashes are nice and dark with this mascara. But having straight lashes that really need a curl, this mascara just weighed it down back to straight. Glad I got a small one to try out first.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Terrific product,SweetprettyP,16 Sep 2020,"I really enjoyed this mascara. I‚Äôve been looking for one that will lengthen and give me plenty of volume. There are plenty of other products that claim to do this, but they dry up quickly or don‚Äôt have a good enough brush for application. This mascara gives me lashes that I can fly away with. The only down side to this mascara is the brush. I love that type of brush, but I feel like it grabs too much product leaving my lashes stuck together when I really enjoy a more full lash look.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Formula Great! Brush...???,toad0707,16 Sep 2020,"This was a great Mascara. The only draw back I had is the brush is hard to figure out. Once you get it, it works nice. It could clump if you don‚Äôt use the brush correctly. The formula though is great!!! It stays on all day. Not flaky and doesn‚Äôt smudge!",Tilbury,Mascara,No

"Fuller, longer lash",keke1292,15 Sep 2020,I really liked this mascara because of how it made my lashes look longer and fuller. If the application has to much product on it before you apply it to your lashes just dab some of it off. You can apply two thin coats to get fuller effect.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing!!!,carrolllq,15 Sep 2020,Amazing!! I absolutely love this mascara!!! I was sooooo nervous about it because I didn‚Äôt like the wand but all I have received is compliments on it!

,xoaudrey,15 Sep 2020,"I love this mascara, it does exactly as it claims: colonized and lengthens. It looks likes you are wearing false lashes when you apply it! I‚Äôve received several complements about my eyelashes since buying it! A bonus is that it does not clump or dry out and lasts all day!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
LUXXXURIOUS LASHES,eyeriebabe,15 Sep 2020,I have absolutely fallen head over heals for this product! The look that it creates is what I literally try to achieve with every mascara and it‚Äôs not always possible or as easy as applying one coat. The brush can be challenging to get use to but it throughly coats with the flat side and defines each lash with the combing sides. The thick formula builds on the lashes with ease and doesn‚Äôt dry out and flake through out the day. The packaging feels luxurious and weighted which feels great in your hand when applying. This is definitely my new favorite mascara and that‚Äôs saying a lot! Definitely recommend if you like a thick dramatic lash!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,bxbyjacks,15 Sep 2020,"This mascara is absolutely amazing! Let‚Äôs talk about how cute the packaging is with the matte pink and the gold top!!! it‚Äôs so cute, this product made my lashes lengthen and very volumizing!

"Separates, lifts, and lengthens",Kjonesyall,15 Sep 2020,"Hands down my new holy grail. Formula is very easy to work with, more on the viscous side I would say vs waxy consistency. Has tons of little spikes to really just cost each Lash and boy does it lift them!! I‚Äôm an esthetician so I have steam and heat in my face all day long and yes, the mascara did smudge a little bit but it was significantly less than others I‚Äôve tried in the past. The packaging makes me feel so nice when I hold it, it‚Äôs nice and weighted. I got it in my influenster box and I was so surprised to have gotten it. I let it sit in my room for a while before trying it and I finally pulled it out today. I was so blown away by how it held up I had to write my review ASAP",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love it!,cisnelu13,15 Sep 2020,"I received this product as a free sample, I enjoyed trying this product. This mascara is a really long lasting product I love it. I like how bid my lashes looked. I really recommend this mascara!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,C1202G,15 Sep 2020,"It did good to my lashes as far as giving me definition and lift but it did absolutely nothing to lengthen them! However, I did go swimming and they were set in stone even though this mascara is not meant to be waterproof. Overall would purchase again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Could've done better...,brebrebeauty,15 Sep 2020,I really wanted to  Like this mascara period of the packaging is adorable and the brush looked like it would really separate the lashes. Sadly I was disappointed by the formulation which was very heavy and made my lashes very clumpy with one coat.. I have my lashes permed and it really weighed them down..  The positive is that I really love the way it looked on my bottom lashes and there was no flaking or smudging and definitely the color was very black as expected. I am hoping that this mascara gets better with age as most of them do in my opinion.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,ainspatt,15 Sep 2020,This mascara is to die for! Beautiful appearance in packaging and is a single wand with dual sides. One side is flat for loading product on the lashes and then you have the bristles to brush the product through. Although not waterproof- rarely gets fallout and keeps your lashes looking plump all day long. Gives the appearance of fake lashes without being fake! Buy this if you‚Äôre looking for a mascara completely worth it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,mpoole,15 Sep 2020,Love this mascara! Does not transfer and really hold my curl and lengthens my lashes!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,hlbrennfleck,15 Sep 2020,"I do overall like this product. My least favorite thing is the stick. Personally, I don‚Äôt love the flat edge. Or maybe it‚Äôs me using it wrong. But when I use the flat edge i find that it clumps up all of the product, then I have to use the other side to help fix it. When i get it where I like it the mascara itself is great!",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,prettylilemi,15 Sep 2020,I did receive this to test for free but I actually really enjoy it! I was skeptical because it‚Äôs $29 but it‚Äôs different and it actually works well for my lashes. It‚Äôs not clumpy but gives the right amount of product to make my lashes voluminous!,Tilbury,Mascara,No

pretty disappointed,halaldisco,15 Sep 2020,i usually LOVE wet mascaras but this is too wet and would be a nightmare with anyone with straighter lashes. sometimes it immediately smudges on me and will eventually crumble off. sucks as i was really looking forward to this but it‚Äôs a definite miss :(,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,jillrk17,15 Sep 2020,I love this new mascara. The wand is great and I noticed how great it was upon the first use. The product itself provided great volume and I loved the look of my dark lashes with this on. I have green eyes so this really made them stand out. It also lasted all day. I would truly recommend this mascara to anyone.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
The Ultimate Mascara,Gammie21,15 Sep 2020,"I wasn‚Äôt sure I would like the brush when I opened it, but love how it defined my eyelashes while making them feel longer and fuller. I received this product as complimentary for testing purposes through influenster and so glad I did.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,stefaniamber,14 Sep 2020,"Definitely one of my new favorite mascaras! the brush is perfect for curling and volumizing but  doesn‚Äôt clump! i haven‚Äôt been wearing makeup very much and i decided to put on just the mascara to try it out and i got a couple compliments saying how nice my eyes looked and my lashes looked so long, someone even thought i had gotten lash extensions!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Best mascara,Alejandrabur1,14 Sep 2020,"Omg I love it, when I first received it complementary for test purposes from Influenster 
I wasn‚Äôt that hipped about it, as soon as I got it I tried it and omg it made my lashes look so dang long like no other mascara had done in so long.

"Very, very impressed.",addellyn,14 Sep 2020,"First of all, a little goes a long way with this mascara. It can become clumpy if you apply too much. But the lift and volume that it gave my lashes, i'm stunned... honestly. My lashes are the most straight, non existent little things on the planet. The wand is like a paddle which allows you to control the amount of product and where it goes. I will definitely make this my new go-to. 

I received this product complimentary for my honest review.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Pleasantly surprised,SaraJane963,14 Sep 2020,I usually prefer a waterproof mascara with a fluffier brush but I was pleasantly surprised with this product! It gave me a lot of length and good volume and lasted pretty well. I received this product complimentary from Influenster.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,SamanthaOjd,14 Sep 2020,I have to say this is one of my favorite products I have received from influenster. My eyelashes are really straight and this product did push them up! It did work for a long time.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great,sierra00715,14 Sep 2020,Would buy again. Great value for the price. Gives volume without making my eyelashes look super clumpy.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not to impressed,ShadowCat2006,14 Sep 2020,"Not sure if it's the formula or the brush but it clumps really bad n doesn't look like I have anything on, doesn't push up anything.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,kyliechristineb,14 Sep 2020,Love this mascara! It‚Äôs lengthens and separates your lashes for a lash lift look! A little product goes a long way too and it stays on even through my water eyes as I‚Äôm in a really heavy Smokey area right now with wild fires. Highly recommend!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Wow,Hailsss26,14 Sep 2020,"One of my favorite items I have received courtesy of influencer. I think this worked great! It really lifted my eyelashes, I have super straight hair and eyelashes so I need any lift I can get. I put this product on every morning and I have a full lift all day long. Loved it!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Gabimuller,14 Sep 2020,"One of the bests mascara I ever used. First of all the product packaging is very fancy and beautiful. Easy to apply, and gives an amazing look to tour lashes because it lengthens and fills it up.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Long but flat,EriJim,14 Sep 2020,"I got this masacra free by Influenster to test out and honestly it‚Äôs a good product, the wand is thin enough to squeeze into the hard corners of the eye to get each lash. It separates and elongates but it does not give it a curl effect, lashes seem flat. Long and straight but flat.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Mixed Feelings,ams47,14 Sep 2020,I have mixed reviews about this mascara. I like the concept of the flat side to coat the lashes and then the brush to comb it through however I feel it clumps large amounts of product on my lashes. Once I comb through the mess of product it does provide a good amount of lift and volume. It lasted all day and did not flake or smudge.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,kimchii18,14 Sep 2020,"I live for this mascara, it works wonders from the best wand I‚Äôve ever used to the super black formula, I absolutely loved this product it made my lashes look beautiful it boosted my confidence to a whole new level, the formula is perfect for lengthening and giving your lashes voluminous  definition. *Received complementary product *",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,BrendaVManrique,14 Sep 2020,"Divine  
I leave my eyelashes all day in their place, full of volumen and super long, I recommend it 100% I use contact lenses and it worked super well.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
DOESNT LIFT,pamsol22,14 Sep 2020,I received this as complimentary gift for an honest review and all I can say is that is not worthy. Yes it does add volume and make them longer but the mascara make my eyelashes going down... The formula is so heavy that can not lift the lashes even for 10 minutes. I do recommend this only if you have natural curly lashes otherwise no. Whatever the presentation is so cute.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,redhead26,14 Sep 2020,"I received free as a sample for an honest review. I could not see The flat side nor the rounded. 

Even being free I cannot recommend this. It smudged my water line terribly.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,jburds,14 Sep 2020,Great formula that keeps lashes curled allll day! The brush is so easy to get every lash even the tiny corner ones. I did receive this product for free for reviewing purposes but will continue to purchase when I run out.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great for lengthening lashes,HeyCharmaineee,13 Sep 2020,"This mascara is really beautiful, I definitely recommend it‚Äôs use if you‚Äôre willing to pay the price for it. On one hand, the body is small so it gets super close to your lash line - the downside is that it gives you more length than body. But it does have some curl to it! Give it a shot and you‚Äôll love it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
GO-TO FOR EVERYDAY,LAinMIA,13 Sep 2020,"I was a little hesitant to try a new mascara but I‚Äôm so glad I did. I have severe eye allergies & heredity dark circles so the last thing I need is a mascara that irritates or flakes and adds to the unwanted drama in the eye area. I had neither with this product. The # 1 thing I require, besides non irritants, is a formula that doesn‚Äôt clump. That‚Äôs a deal breaker for me. This formula went on smooth and evenly. One coat could even be enough for some. Two was right for me. The silicone wand picks up and deposits perfectly. No spider eyes. The narrowing of the wand makes the lower lashes & inner corners a breeze. I also really appreciate the tube & handle itself. No skimping on product and the ergonomic wand allows a confident grip for people without a steady hand. This is a high quality, everyday mascara. Not high drama, but nice lengthening, thickening and pigment. Great mascara for those of us that need mascara, ( talking to you fellow blondes with translucent eyelashes), but aren‚Äôt going full glam. Highly recommend, will purchase when this tube runs out.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
great if you want really long lashes!,Jaymielynnmua,13 Sep 2020,I really like this mascara personally but it‚Äôs definitely a unique wand it‚Äôs very thin and plastic like but it makes your lashes so incredibly long and beautiful. I also love the formula it doesn‚Äôt smudge and is very easy to apply. Not to mention the packaging is gorgeous. I would definitely recommend this mascara if you want really long lashes. I received this product from influenster.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
FAVORITE MASCARA,brookenevius,13 Sep 2020,"I absolutely love this mascara! It adds length, curl and volume to my lashes effortlessly. It‚Äôs not too clumpy and it stays on all day without losing length or volume! One of my most favorite mascaras ever! Absolutely love it!!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
AMAZINGGGG,Deeps97,13 Sep 2020,"This mascara is AMAZING! Often times i have a hard time finding a mascara that doesn‚Äôt clump up my lashes, lengthens my lashes, and is longwearing and this mascara is it!! The formula is so amazing and makes my lashes look like spider legs without clumping them! The brush is not too thick nor too thin! So it can be applied effortlessly on my inner eye and outer eye!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,QueenAshBees,13 Sep 2020,This mascara didn‚Äôt work FOR ME. I used one coat and my lashes immediately clumped together. By the end of getting dressed for church I looked like I had five eyelashes. I tried saving with my lash separator and it began to smear. I LOVE CT products but this one just didn‚Äôt seem to work for me.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Ew Favorite Mascara!,Cheyannelove,13 Sep 2020,"The Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes mascara is now my favorite mascara! At first the wand seemed weird to me since it‚Äôs flat and only has bristles on the two skinny sides. Once I got a hang of the design, I makes since. It lengthens, curls, and separates the lashes! I love it! Totally recommend it!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Cute lashes!,HeyyJulie0,13 Sep 2020,I really liked this mascara. It wasn‚Äôt too thick but extended my lashes almost double. I have small lashes but I felt very confident after using this product.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing mascara,jms1985,13 Sep 2020,"The #pillowtalkmascara  was AWESOME. I am very selective when it comes to mascara. I love a long natural lash. This does what it says, At first put it on one eye to test out product and noticed how smooth the formula was. I love how it elongated all my lashes and lifted them up. I wore this product a whole day and there was no flaming or crumbling at the end of the day. Received this as a free sample and loved it so much I will be using this as my daily.",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Smudgy Meas,toomuchmkup,13 Sep 2020,"Application of this mascara was nice, good lengthening and definition of individual lashes, v pretty.
What‚Äôs not pretty is that it eventually smudges as you wear and by the end of the day I had raccoon eyes. So while the formula initially works great the smudging is a real mess and I am returning. Reformulate and try again!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Unbelievable Mascara!,Jaimmm,13 Sep 2020,"Absolutely amazing volume! I love how easy this mascara applies and glides along your lashes. It makes them look so full and bold I couldn‚Äôt believe it. It stays on all day long and when it‚Äôs time to take off, it comes off easily on a makeup wipe. I received this product along with the prep/primer spray as a complimentary product from Influenster and will 100% purchase when I finish them both. Two thumbs up from me!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
The best ever mascara,mimihawbaker,13 Sep 2020,I absolutely love this mascara it has great lengthening components and separates my lashes to make them look for in the luminous in this mascara stays on all day almost better than my usual tart mascara,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Some Mascara!,CookLynnNicole,13 Sep 2020,"The formula for this is very wet, when first applying I realized a little goes a LONG way. My lashes had an amazing extended amount on them an they looked so full. I‚Äôd recommend wiping the brush on the tube to not apply as much, but overall it was really great! Photos are before mascara and after applying",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love it,kishka13,13 Sep 2020,I like this mascara a lot. It makes lashes super long! I love the packaging and the brush! Also I was impressed how long it stays on. I was wearing it for 15 hours and it still looked good. I would recommend it to everyone who wants to have extra long lashes!,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Grew to like it...,allikay29,12 Sep 2020,"Grew to like this product. I definitely didn‚Äôt like this mascara the first time I used it, it made my lashes clumpy and I just wasn‚Äôt for it. But after a week of using it and adjusting how I apply the product I notice do you have to make sure you‚Äôre not pressing hard with the brush against your lashes it definitely doesn‚Äôt have any capabilities of making your lashes look thicker but I do like the mascara. I don‚Äôt like how hard it is to get off you definitely feel like you have to scrub it off it‚Äôs almost like a waterproof consistency but it‚Äôs not too bad. Will I use this product until it runs out? Absolutely, I would never let mascara go to waste.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love it,Angelicaalvarez,12 Sep 2020,"Really like it make my lashes look pretty long and super black , doesn‚Äôt flake at all and last all day",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Pricey, but Amazing",GowanGirl13,12 Sep 2020,"Charlotte Tilbury is known for being a bit pricey, but really good. This product lives up to that. My lashes look so much longer and more defined! The unique wand works wonders! Plus, this mascara doesn‚Äôt fade away to nothing by the end of the day. It is an extremely dark mascara and really only needs one coat to do what it says it will. This is one of the best mascaras I‚Äôve ever tried! #complimentary",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Will definitely purchase again!,freetobefrankie,12 Sep 2020,"I really love how this makes my eye lashes look. Before Pillow Talk mascara, I was a die hard fan for benefit roller lashes but this definitely works so much better! This mascara really fans out and lifts my lashes no falsies needed. The only downside I‚Äôve noticed is if I wear it too long (like a full 8+ hour work day) my eyes seem to get a little dried and irritated so I would recommend as best for a night out or something no more than a few hours long",Tilbury,Mascara,No
I love it!,RileyNLaylasMom,12 Sep 2020,"I love this mascara! I applied it as soon as my package arrived. I've been on the hunt for a new mascara and I've never tried any other Charlotte products before. The color is BLACK which is great. It does flake/smudge after about 15 hours of wear, but thats normal. I love how it seperates, lengthens and curls my lashes. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to price, but it is a normal high end mascara price. I recommend it if you're on the market for a high end luxury mascara. I received this mascara in return for my honest review",Tilbury,Mascara,No
love ittt,mercedeszemua,12 Sep 2020,"I personally really like the product it‚Äôs super dark and rich in color, I just wish the bristles were a bit longer.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,muaNAINA,12 Sep 2020,This mascara is amazing ! It‚Äôs so jet black and really makes your lashes pop. Also the wand is a thin silicone wand that combs through your lashes and separates them. This mascara was sent to me for testing purposes but I genuinely have no complaints about it !,Tilbury,Mascara,No
AMAZING MASCARA,ashsmashley,12 Sep 2020,"This Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes Volumizing & Lengthening Mascara is my new go-to!  I was able to try this product in exchange for my honest review. I honestly believe this mascara is god-tier!! I already have naturally long lashes, but they aren‚Äôt very full. This made my lashes look amazing & huge! I will definitely be purchasing another one of these for my purse. The formula didn‚Äôt leave my eyelashes crusted or flaky. The mascara also did not leave any black marks on my face, as my lashes are long enough to touch below my eyebrow. Definitely recommend trying this product out!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Didn‚Äôt love it,Jackiesmith216,12 Sep 2020,I really wanted to love this product but I didn‚Äôt. It was a really wet consistency which made it smear easily until it was completely dry. That was a deal breaker for me but if it doesn‚Äôt bother you it might be perfect for you. Overall it was great at lengthening and didn‚Äôt clump. If it wasn‚Äôt as wet of a formula I would love this product.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
great,joceyycxx,12 Sep 2020,wow such an upgrade from my last mascara . So dark and helps w/ my baby lashes,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Creates Long Dramatic Lashes,Adrienneurban,12 Sep 2020,"I have thin blonde eyelashes and usually I need multiple coats of mascara for them to look thick, long, and black. However, this mascara gives me dramatic looking lashes with one mere swipe.
I would not recommend following the first part of the directions and using the flat part to load your lash up with mascara before you comb it because it winds up clumpy with excessive mascara. This mascara also wears off by the end of the day and has a tendency to smudge. So if you're an active person during the day or are in hot weather it will most likely come off.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
One stop shop mascara!!,carrollkaley,12 Sep 2020,"Thank you Influenster for my complimentary mascara! Disclaimer: I am a MEGA Charlotte Tilbury fan! All of her products are high quality, and look fabulous. And this mascara was no exception. Someone once told me that one mascara cant do it all, but this one can. It defined, lengthened, and volumized my lashes! And it absolutely did not flake, and it was still easy to remove at the end of the day!!I am beyond satisfied with this product! This was by far the best most exciting VoxBox I have received to date! Thank you again Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
My new favorite,kkroll22,12 Sep 2020,"I have used the same 2 mascaras for 8 years so for me to switch it up, it had to be something that knocked my mascara routine out of the park. Well, this one mascara did it. It takes way less time and I get better results! It stays on well and lasts all day.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love it!,bmw344,11 Sep 2020,"This mascara made my lashes so long! The wand really helps to give an even layer and avoid clumping! It is on the pricier side, but definitely worth it if mascara is a main staple in your makeup routine!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Make your eyes the center of attention!!!,AannWRootbeer,11 Sep 2020,"An easy applied mascara to allow your eyes to dazzle and pop with just application. Quick and in a hurry is something I look for in a product and Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes is honestly a personal favorite. With or without eyeshadow, this product just allows the natural color of your eyes to be the star of the show but adding that extra volume to your lashes. With a applicator that allows the product to evenly distribute onto each lash, it gets added bonus for getting the smaller fine lashes in the corner of the eye. The packaging is absolutely fantastic and beautiful. It is simply chic and elegant while being classy. 

Though a great product, this product is not water proof and should probably used with a water proof mascara if you plan on being in the hot sun all day or will be doing some crying, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Still an absolute great product that I have used a few times since receiving it as a free sample to try.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,abigggailx3,11 Sep 2020,"Loved the products packaging very girly, and pretty. Pretty pricey, the only thing I notice was it made my lashes pop. Loved the brush it didn‚Äôt clump like others do.

AMAZING,moonlightcutie,11 Sep 2020,"I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.
I really like this mascara. I think it‚Äôs very creative to incorporate a brush into the mascara. It absolutely gave length to my lashes and made them look longer. I don‚Äôt think I can criticize this mascara, only thing I would say is  it would be better if it was waterproof. Then it would be 5 stars for me.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Totally worth it,kaydita,11 Sep 2020,I really enjoyed this mascara it didn‚Äôt clump my eyelashes and made them long and pretty,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Don't sleep on this!,BQS16,11 Sep 2020,"oh my god this mascara! it's flat bristles are amazing for lengthening and curling. it also doesn't clump so that's an A+.

Awesome mascara,enjoykarmababy,11 Sep 2020,"I got this mascara #complimentary from #influenster. I love it!  Easy to apply when you in a rush or you can build up thicker and long lashes when you have time. Brush is soooooo amazing! It makes your lashes looks more full but at the same time separates!

I like it!,Alexishaab,11 Sep 2020,This product does lengthen and volumizes your lashes. I do think they can get clumpy if you don‚Äôt use it right.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love it!,BelleAdair,11 Sep 2020,I have tried many Mascaras over the years and this one definitely lives up to the name. When it says push-up lashes it really means it. My lashes look so much fuller and longer with just one use without having to reapply over and over again. definitely recommend,Tilbury,Mascara,No
I really  love it!,priincess1955,11 Sep 2020,I was actually surprised at the negative reviews because for me this product was amazing. It worked just like advertised. Lifted my lashes and added length. I loved the brush and found the mascara easy to apply and noticed an immediate lifting. The color was perfect. I will definitely be purchasing this again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Awesome,alexisvb,11 Sep 2020,Love the product. It applies super creamy and makes my lashes really long and full. Only thing I dislike is the wand forces you to work the product around so your lashes aren‚Äôt stuck together. Great mascara,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,tlmoon,11 Sep 2020,"Not likely to purchase. I‚Äôve used it twice but will attempt a third time to make sure. Observations so far, lashes appear long and voluminous. The wand and product did not lift my lashes. The mascara appeared to wash clean at night but I woke up with smudges. My ride or die mascara does not cause this issue. I attempted the mascara a send time after curling my lashes first for extra lift. They didn‚Äôt stay lifted or curled. It‚Äôs almost as though the product is heavy on my lashes. Obviously I will attempt various methods and use less product, double up on cleanser, etc. Just not overly excited about it yet. 


In the photo my favorite mascara is on the left and CT is on the right. Length looks better from this angle bc the right lashes didn‚Äôt curl. 

I received this product complimentary for testing.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
It‚Äôs ok,StellaKai,11 Sep 2020,I have only been using this product for two days so I will continue to use it but I‚Äôm not impressed. It‚Äôs very light and doesn‚Äôt give it much volume or length. I do like the applicator for the desperation.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Works for me!,AmyKSedlacek,11 Sep 2020,"It‚Äôs a weird wand, okay. But it separated well and has lasted through my night shift at the hospital! I will defiantly continue to use it.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Yes...it really does work!,Twocrazydogs,11 Sep 2020,"Purchased the mini size dark black.  I have blue eyes and white hair.  My eyelashes are long but not thick.   Over the years, I am sure I have spent a small fortune on mascara.  I really like the smaller sizes because I throw out my mascara every 6 months.  I will definitely purchase this again.  Black smudges around the bottom of my eyes after wearing all day was the reason I only gave it a 4/5.  I forgot to apply primer before I applied the product.  I like that it does not clump when applying and that it doesn't cause my eyes to water!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,ljoiner92,10 Sep 2020,"The mascara is pretty good, it has a lasting stay which is nice but I have definitely had better volume inducing mascaras before",Tilbury,Mascara,No
C.T mascara,Pogsilva10,10 Sep 2020,"maybe I would buy this product because of its beautiful packaging, but the product compared to what was promised did not meet my expectations, I didn‚Äôt think my lashes were 93% more bulky or 96% more lengthens, the mask is quite black as promised  ‚ÄúSuper black‚Äù, the applicator is also good, but it was not a product that exceeded my expectations.  it's a good product!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
This is a must!!,S0phaloaf,10 Sep 2020,Love love love!! The brush is super cool because the flat side really packs on the product and the thinner side allows you to really lengthen and separate lashes. I highly recommend this product to even the pickiest mascara lover.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,truewants,10 Sep 2020,WOW! Received this #charlottetilbury New Launch Mascara Pillow Talk Push UP in a VOX Box..I truly do not know where to start. The Unique Brush or the Formula or the combination of both. The Volume and Rich Dark Black Definition this gave my lashes just blew me away. You start with the flat side of the Wand at the base of your lashes then turn the wand and comb it out..the Length on the first coat amazing..you can stop there..I continued with the 2nd Coat and no clumping just more volume..also at the end of the day I removed it easily with Micellar water..No flacking ..no racoom eyes..simply perfection. #complimentary @ctilburymakeup #charlottetilbury..

Best Mascara EVER!!,Nanababii,10 Sep 2020,I absolutely love this product!It is such a big bottle so there is so much product! It also made my lashes look really full and thick which I love!

My lashes look fluffy and lengthened,Sunisaeve,10 Sep 2020,I really like this mascara. The brush is easy to apply on my lashes. My lashes look fluffy and lengthened after 12 hrs my lashes are still beautiful. I‚Äôm so in love with the packaging it‚Äôs super cute. I would buy a new one if this one run out.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
So good!,RobertaMM,10 Sep 2020,So genuinely surprised. Id honestly never heard of this brand so this was my absolute first time trying it out. I love this mascara and it may very well be my newest go to. It gives so much length! It doesn‚Äôt clump up or fall apart if you touch your eyelash. Definitely recommend!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,maryelaglz,10 Sep 2020,I received this mask from influenster. I loved the product packaging. When I saw the brush I was a little scared because I thought that all my eyelashes would come together but I was wrong. They were very beautiful and only with one pass of the product (that's my taste). Maybe with a little more practice I will use it better. I recommend it.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Whole new meaning to pillow talk,kscott19,10 Sep 2020,"Thank you to Influenster for sending me this item free to test and review. I loved this mascara. It‚Äôs a huge size, and it‚Äôs affordable for the size and brand. It took me a few runs to get comfortable with the brush. However, great color, product, size, look. Highly recommend. 

Plus my man kept commenting on how my eyelashes were bringing so much more attention to my eyes",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Length,almay13,10 Sep 2020,"I received this complimentary from Influenster for an honest review. first of all, the packaging of this mascara is just so aesthetically pleasing. the tube is such a pretty pink with rose gold accents, and otherwise fairly simple. the brush scared me at first. I havent been fond of those rubber style short bristle brushes. but i noticed it was flared out and flat as well, giving it more surface area. first coat immediately added a lot of length. a few more swipes and they looked much more full and curled. one eye seemed just a bit clumpy but I separated them with an old brush. I think with a little practice with this style wand it won't be like that. it was relatively easy to remove too. I normally go for a brown mascara for every day, and black for occasions. I definitely will continue to use this.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing for small Asian lashes,skymmylk,10 Sep 2020,"I have quite small and thin Asian lashes so it‚Äôs very hard for me to find the perfect mascara. Okay, this is probably the BEST mascara I‚Äôve ever used!! My tried and true was the Lanc√¥me Grandiose mascara but this mascara beats it out of the park. The formula is on the wetter side but it HOLDS onto each single lash. I like that the wand is also narrow enough for the corners and because the brushes are on 2 sides, it doesn‚Äôt brush against my under eye. It‚Äôs great applying to lower lashes too. You can coat as many times (I did 2x) and it doesn‚Äôt clump up on my lashes. My lashes are thicker, longer, and smudgeless.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,dani1001,10 Sep 2020,I wasn‚Äôt really fond of the brush. It was really good at lengthening but there was no volume at all.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
love the wand!!!!,makeuplovermom,10 Sep 2020,"I really really enjoy the wand . The brush makes it very easy to coat my lashes. Gives them a more fluffy natural look instead of a
Clumpy spider looking lashes.  It takes a bit for the mascara to dry but it doesn‚Äôt bother me. It hasn‚Äôt transferred on me even when I didn‚Äôt set my concealer. I definitely recommend trying it out. To me it was worth the price.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,tigergirl20,10 Sep 2020,"Although there are a lot of mixed reviews on this mascara, I love it! The flat side deposits pigment, and the bristles brush through and separate my lashes beautifully! I received this complimentary from Influenster, but I will be repurchasing once I run out!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,anushka101,10 Sep 2020,The best mascara ever!!!! It lasts for 24 hours straight without smudging. It is light weighted and is very easy to apply! Overall its a 5/5 for me,Tilbury,Mascara,No
So good!,mariechanel,10 Sep 2020,"I am so impressed. Firstly I am really glad I had instructions. I never would have used the flat side if I hadn‚Äôt read it. It does exactly what it says - coats the eye lashes which at first I wasn‚Äôt sure about. Then combs through for long, falsie looking lashes. I have a lot of mascaras because I‚Äôm a junkie for good lashes and I am seriously impressed. Will be buying this in the future!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Put this mascara to the test!,Alex1025,10 Sep 2020,This mascara is very nicebmy eyes look lit up. The only thing I don't like is that my lashes look thin it does not make them look full. I think that has to do with the brush. Otger than that it stayed on very well lengthened my lashes. I was able to reach every little lash.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Finally a mascara that doesn‚Äôt clump!!,LB1993,10 Sep 2020,This mascara is like every other Charlotte Tilbury product I‚Äôve tried: INCREDIBLE! It keeps my lashes separated while lengthening and volumizing. I am so impressed and will not be using another mascara but this from here on out!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,tanyadavid,10 Sep 2020,It does at it promise! Gives volume and it lift! Best part NO CRUMBS! Feels so light and looks natural!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
WOW,sialabarcard1ac,10 Sep 2020,"Holy cow. This mascara is amazing. The spread of product on my lashes is amazing and it defines and lengthens so beautifully. I love how easily it glides on, and the different sides of the mascara wand help you create the look you want! Great staying power, too! (I received a free sample as a part of Influenster. My review is my true opinion)",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,chrstne1024,10 Sep 2020,"ok so like many of these reviews, I too really love this mascara. yes the application process is a bit of a learning curve, but if you follow the instructions, your lashes will be lifted, fanned and volumized to the point of looking false. it's amazing! but within an hour, you'll have black circles around your eyes and no matter what you do, you can't get that to not happen (at least in my experience). 

the first time I tried this, it was admittedly a very hot day. I figured the raccoon eyes were due to me being a bit sweaty. the next time, I tried it on a day where I was inside central air all day. same problem. I then tried fully setting my under eye (usually I do a light dusting of rms powder or often nothing). same problem. I then tried upper lashes only. Same problem. and come on, like how even? it only migrated to under my eyes when it wasn't even applied there to avoid exactly that. so frustrating! I even tried putting it on lightly using the comb side only (not loading up with the flat edge first as it instructs). same problem. 

so after all that, I just don't know how or when I could wear this. initially my thought was that it's just not a warm weather mascara, but it doesn't seem to stay in colder weather either. and it's not even like oh by the end of the day it's under my eyes. it's nearly immediate. and even after you clean it up, it just happens again! 

my normal go to is ysl curl which stays in place pretty well and more recently hourglass unlocked which truly stays put through most everything (and is AMAZING). I don't like waterproof mascara, nor have I ever really needed it, but whatever it is for me and this mascara, it just doesn't work. I was surprised reading through all the other reviews that no one else seemed to have this problem, but it seems like a lot of these reviews are from gifted products. I purchased this and wore it out and this is just my honest experience! super bummed though cause it could be great (thus the 3 stars).",Tilbury,Mascara,No
My new fav,meghanbh94,10 Sep 2020,My new favorite mascara! I love the wand and how it really spreads your lashes out. This mascara makes my eyelashes look so long and gives good volume!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Worth a try!,sweetpotat00,9 Sep 2020,I really love this mascara. I thought that with one side being flat it would be time consuming to use but i do feel like my lashes have more volume! I like the stiffness of the brush side for separating my lashes and the flat side for coating them. I also appreciate that while it‚Äôs smudge proof & long wearing it is not a nightmare to remove at the end of the day!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing mascara for all eye makeup lovers!,Jennifer90sBaby,9 Sep 2020,I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing. I absolutely love this mascara!! It‚Äôs unlike any other mascara in the market. It elongates the lashes and creates volume. No falsies required! I could barely see any smudging once I applied it. It lasts throughout the day. I‚Äôd totally recommend this product!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,emiliavs,9 Sep 2020,"I received this product to test from influenster and it has been such a life changing product!!! After applying I could see the difference without it, it leaves my lash looking so long lengthy and adds a lot of volume. The wand size is perfect because it makes it easier to apply without causing any smudge. It lasted through the whole day! My new favorite mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Brucey32,9 Sep 2020,"Seriously impressed. First of all, glad I had a little instructions - never would have used the flat side if I hadn‚Äôt read it and it‚Äôs a game changer. It does exactly what it says - coats the eye lashes which at first I was like woah that‚Äôs a lot. Then combs through for long, false eyelashes look lashes. I have a lot of mascaras because I‚Äôm a junkie for good lashes and I am seriously impressed. Will be buying this in the future!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
WOW!,Luvmy2kidz2020,9 Sep 2020,"Wow! I was thrilled to receive my Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes Mascara today and completely blown away by the length that it added to my lashes! It went on smoothly and they just got longer and longer! It came in a nice little box and the tube itself was very pretty.  I loved the dual sided load and comp wand as it made it easier to get to my short bottom lashes as well. Very, very impressed with this Mascara and will definitely purchase again and highly recommend ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Pass,MULOVA,9 Sep 2020,I love CT but this was a fail. The brush was really difficult to use. It did make my lashes look long and full but holy moly did this smudge badly. Returning unfortunately.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Pretty good!!,kh68727,9 Sep 2020,"I just got this mascara and tried it for the first time today and i can say that its pretty good. The packaging is really cute and i just love the overall aesthetic. it worked well for me. some of the better things about it were that my lashes were definitely darker and stood out more once i applied it. my lashes were also much more voluminous afterwards. also, it didnt dry too fast so i could build it up. a couple things that could be improved on are that i didnt feel like it separated my lashes very well. they were a but clumped together after i applied it. also my lashes feel fairly heavy now which i dont love but they have held their curl so it isnt too heavy. i gave this mascara a 4/5 because, although it did work well and i liked it, there were a couple of things that could be improved on which i explained earlier in my review. overall i would recommend this mascara, especially if your main reason for using mascara is to darken your lashes because this is super dark!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love it!,WanessaR,9 Sep 2020,"In love with this mascara! It has a surprisingly powerful wand that reaches my eyelashes from the roots to its ends, making them curlier and longer than ever with just one layer!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,nattyylite,9 Sep 2020,I haven‚Äôt spent hundreds of dollars looking for the best mascara. This is by far the best. My lashes look so long that someone asked if they were real or fake. I love the dual brush! So creative and it truly makes a difference.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,gr8smiley,9 Sep 2020,"I really liked this mascara. I really felt that it lengthened and also separated my lashes. I already have pretty long eyelashes, but this definitely made them more voluminous. Would recommend !",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great Mascara,DAYROD,9 Sep 2020,Love this product. Used it only once (today) and it‚Äôs in my top 3 mascaras! Leaves my lashes with a lot of volume and length. Definitely recommend this product :) **Received this product free from Influenster**,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Complimentary mascara from influenster,dani428742,9 Sep 2020,"Let me start off by saying I love mascara , so I received this complimentary mascara from influenster I was excited . Now I thought the mascara I owned now did wonders but this Charlotte tilbury mascara is the bomb , it gets your bottom eyelashes so well and leaves your eyelashes not looking clumped .",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love it !,Lexis0102,9 Sep 2020,"I received this product free from Influenster and I love it the formula is so smooth and leaves my eyelashes looking long, full and beautiful definitely one of my favorites now !",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Ehh,AriesXA4718,9 Sep 2020,"I received this through Influenster , I am very picky with mascara and was super excited to try this one ... I am not impressed the formula is decent, the wand is absolutely horrible and it distributes way to much product onto your lashes ...",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,strwbrryshrtcke,9 Sep 2020,I got to try this free from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion! I love the way this lengthens my eyelashes without making them clumpy at all the wand is great it evenly distributed the product exactly where it needed to go instead of clumping my lashes together.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Nadpineapple,9 Sep 2020,"Decent black mascara, adds volume but clumps a lot. Only use the bristle side, and really good for lowr lashes. Might improve as it dries over time",Tilbury,Mascara,No

,KateTheClassy,9 Sep 2020,"Holy crap, this is amazing. I didn‚Äôt expect to like this as much as I do but I have to say, I actually got the results they print on the packaging! I received this complimentary from Influenster for review purposes, but that doesn‚Äôt impact my opinion of the mascara. I got HUGE lashes and didn‚Äôt even need to curl them, they were suuuuper black and defined, and I‚Äôm obsessed.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Pillow talk,JMH7,9 Sep 2020,This mascara is amazing! I love that the brush is double sided so you can put on product with one side and flip it around to brush it out and avoid the spiderwebby look some other brands give! It‚Äôs light weight and comes in super cute packaging!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
LOVE LOVE LOVE,jadenpomroy,9 Sep 2020,I am always looking for a great mascara! I‚Äôve tried tons and this is one of my favorites now. My eyelashes are rather short but this mascara lengthens them tons and gives the perfect amount of volume. It‚Äôs super buildable too so I can make them more dramatic if needed.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
@constanzuh,con7beauty,9 Sep 2020,"I LOVE what this mascara does for my lashes! I used the flat side to get all the product on my lashes, then I used the comb side to separate. It was a little clumpy at first but the comb side really helps. My lashes look like I have falsies on!! The formula is also super black! 110% recommend!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
<3,brit1468,9 Sep 2020,I am so in love with this mascara.  I love that it‚Äôs made in Germany it makes me feel like I can trust the ingredients more.  My lashes look so voluminous and I‚Äôve never had such a good lash profile without falsies.  I received this product complimentary to try and I will be purchasing ASAP!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
LOVE,Emmasuzanne,9 Sep 2020,"SERIOUSLY SO HAPPY I RECIEVED THIS MASCARA! ( I did get it for free). Honestly, I did not know what to expect with this brand as I have never used it before. I am SO IMPRESSED. Ideals in a mascara for me would be volume, length, and not having to put 20 coats on to achieve that. This did all of those things! The first swipe immediately added volume and length and I have never once owned a mascara that does that, and I have owned many.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
One of the best,vicky0503,9 Sep 2020,This is one of the best mascaras I have ever owned. I received this is my voxbox and I gotta tell you it‚Äôs amazing! I have the straightest lashes ever and no mascara holds up but this one is probably one of the few that actually looks like it does something.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
REAL push up lashes!,h0neydip,9 Sep 2020,Got to try this for free on my voxbox! And wow I couldn‚Äôt be happier!. Great dark color and helps my lashes look amazing!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Potential gimmick,Olaska,9 Sep 2020,"I think this is more gimmicky then functional. The black color is very pretty and on my lower lashes it looks beautiful! But it doesn‚Äôt quite give me the volume, length, and curl I am used to from my usual mascara. I definitely will use it but it‚Äôs not my go to!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Buy it!!,mimi12898,9 Sep 2020,"This mascara makes my lashes look SO good! And it applies so well and stays on with no smudging, I recommend this to anyone who‚Äôs ready to upgrade their mascara game!!",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Great for lengthening,ames02,8 Sep 2020,"I received this mascara and was so excited to try the new style of brush. I have naturally long lashes anyways so I was looking forward to see the difference. It worked great for length and lasted all day without smudging. But as for volume and thickness, it just wasn‚Äôt there for me.

I received this product free to test from Influenster.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Honestly ...,Aleeex13,8 Sep 2020,"I guess it depends on what you like ... unfortunately I did not like it at all. I love a mascara that can curl, plump, nicely separate my lashes and not flake. This mascara was a miss for me ... it left my lashes looking so dull after I had curled them. Not the best in my books.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Lashes,RikkaIzawa1,8 Sep 2020,"I really enjoy this mascara and think I might even love it. Half the time when I try luxury mascaras they tend to flake on me. This one doesn't. It didn't smudge either. There is a learning curve with it because not all of the sides have bristles. Since it's not completely covered in bristles, I do still roll it through my lashes when I start at the base. The sides that have no bristles or teeth, rather since it's plastic; has flat end that gather product, but not too much. when I roll it the flat side applies product and the other combs it through my lashes. My lashes didn't clump or anything, but they did fan out nicely. I would buy this once it's gone or dried out. Its a thin wet formula in case anyone was wondering and I feel the stopper gets off most of the product so it doesn't overload your lashes. Would give this 4.5 if I could only because of the learning curve with application.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
It was a meh experience,morgant97,8 Sep 2020,This product was kinda disappointing. I like the whole two sided concept but it didn‚Äôt work well. Even after trying to zig zag my lashes looked extremely lumpy. I really loved how black the mascara was. Besides that it was okay just not worth the price.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Not as good as Buxom Lash Volumizing Mascara,MandiiJean,8 Sep 2020,"I don't love or hate this mascara.  It's an interesting concept but I doesn't work well with my lash type.  I have long thin/delicate lashes that many mascaras cause to clump. I need volume not length. 

The volumizing side of the brush brisels are not long enough to eliminate lash clumps in my case.  

Back to my all time favorite Buxom - Lash Volumizing Mascara!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Jeniy,8 Sep 2020,I‚Äôm used to the Diorshow but decided to get the Mini of this to try. My husband noticed and thought I had my fake lashes on and told me he liked them better than the ones I usually use lol. When I told him it was just mascara he was shook. My friends also thought I had fake lashes on so now I love this mascara. It definitely made my lashes appear longer but I feel the formula is a little heavy so after awhile my lashes curl couldn‚Äôt stay up. It was harder to take off but overall I do like the look this product gives me.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
It‚Äôs alright,brimcardenas,8 Sep 2020,"Okay, so I do love the packaging and the color of this mascara. However, the brush is hard to work with, it‚Äôs very messy since it‚Äôs a wet formula, and it doesn‚Äôt hold your curl very well. The instructions say to use the flat eye and then the brush side... but unless you like SUPER clumpy mascara, stick to only using the brush side.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Innovative brush,Combatacnbarbie,8 Sep 2020,"I have been testing this mascara out for the last four days. The first day of testing I tested this product with foundation, and after 8 hours I noticed no product transfer. The second day I did only mascara and wore it for ten hours with a slight transfer under the eye at the end of the day. These were days where I wasn't sweating much. The last day I wore it to the gym (I know, I know) only for testing purposes. After working up a good sweat I did notice transfer above and under my eyes. Really though I expected this as it doesn't claim to be sweat proof, just smudge proof. The mascara has an innovative new brush, there are two places on the brush that are flat. This is where you will place the mascara on the lashes, it might take a few tries to get it but I found it to be very intuitive. Then you will use the comb side to lift and lengthen the lashes. I really enjoyed this product and would purchase after this sample runs out. I thought the bride did an excellent job of separating the lashes and lifting them. I thought my lashes looked great with this mascara.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,itsanasweetie,8 Sep 2020,By far one of my favorite mascara of all time ! Got to try for free on my voxbox. Couldn‚Äôt be more happy . Very dark color and helps my lashes look big !,Tilbury,Mascara,No

Tricky Wand,ayyjennifer,8 Sep 2020,I really liked the formula of this mascara and love how my lashes looked after but I have to admit the wand was really tricky to use and definitely made me take longer when doing my lashes,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great product,LyssandLei,8 Sep 2020,"I LOVE this product! The packaging is adorable, I‚Äôm always a fan of pink. And I love the way my lashes look with this mascara. They look longer and they don‚Äôt clump. I like the actual wand - it‚Äôs thin and helps reduce clumping.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Smudges,annieorphan,8 Sep 2020,"I got the mini one to try it out. It does make your lashes lush and beautiful. But after one week of testing it out, it smudged after every single time.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,raelynjs,8 Sep 2020,"Loved the volume this game my lashes! I don‚Äôt have very long lashes and most mascaras that add falsies make them look chunky! This really helped separate my lashes and added an average amount of length. Love the natural look of this!
I received this for testing purposes from Influenster.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,AlondraMRosale,8 Sep 2020,"This mascara is perfect for all those people whose lashes are few and light in color, this mascara makes them look abundant and your eyes look more expressive and large.

,basicallybrii,8 Sep 2020,"The packaging of this product is so cute! I was a little nervous at first because of the brush size, it‚Äôs smaller than what I normally use, but I absolutely LOVE this mascara! It stays on all day, goes on amazing and comes off easily makeup remover.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Influenster,trillaxblue,7 Sep 2020,This mascara is bomb. Better than most other high end mascaras. My eyelashes looked bomb after one use. I loved the dual end sides.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,mscleopatra,7 Sep 2020,"DO NOT BUY! Worst mascara I have ever used. As a fan of the two other Charlotte tilbury mascaras, I had high hopes for this one. It was very clumpy going on, had zero volume, dried right away making it impossible to build any more on top. I had raccoon eyes after wearing it for a couple of hours and my eyelashes looked stumpy and sad. As an avid mascara user, this is not a good product and makes your eyelashes look tacky.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,MeganMakennzie1,7 Sep 2020,"This mascara is great! It helps my lashes to hold a curl all day, adds lots of volume and length plus does not flake! I am not the biggest fan of the brush, as I feel the bristles are a little short. But, all in all, it works great!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Wand is tricky, but makes lashes look great!",kwelch74,7 Sep 2020,This mascara is really nice! It‚Äôs smooth and super dark. The wand is a bit tricky and it dries a bit faster than I would like so using the comb takes practice. But it does really lift your lashes! I would recommend for someone looking for a moderately priced mascara that lifts without clumping.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Good product,princessashleigh,7 Sep 2020,I like the brush and it lengthens well.  Have to really load on and wiggle to get more volume.  It does not clump.  Big bonus.  I ordered the small to make sure I liked it before diving into the larger cost.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Innovative,AshleyyFawn,7 Sep 2020,I received this product complimentary of influenster and I‚Äôm glad I did! The brush for this mascara has two side which I think is very interesting and smart!

Messy,jen0729,7 Sep 2020,"I received this as a promo to test and write an honest review . I love mascara it‚Äôs my go to product I use everyday , my lashes on their own aren‚Äôt super full and they don‚Äôt curl naturally so I rely on mascara to do that for me . This mascara is a no go for me . The application method is messy and it‚Äôs super clumpy even after using the comb side . The consistency feels more watery and cheap than my typical mascara which adds to the messiness when using . I am not a fan of this and would def not buy it .",Tilbury,Mascara,No

LONG LASTING IN 100¬∞ HEAT,Laureng914,6 Sep 2020,I used this mascara for the first time this past weekend during my visit to the Disney world parks in over 100¬∞ heat.

Highly recommend,KatToronto,6 Sep 2020,"Love this mascara!I am a huge CT fan, however the other mascaras transfers and leave a raccoon under eye.

,KaylaMQ91,6 Sep 2020,"I‚Äôm loving this mascara! It makes my lashes look really long and pushes them up. The brush is pretty cool as well, you use the flat side to apply the mascara and the you use the rounded edges to push them up. I only didn‚Äôt like how wet it was, it took a bit to dry down and I have super hooded eyes so it kind of transferred to my eye lid a little. But overall would definitely still recommend!",Tilbury,Mascara,No

Love it,genesisnn,6 Sep 2020,"I love this mask, since my eyelashes tend to fall, they do not have much volume when combing them, it has been very difficult for me to maintain them, thanks to this product I was able to achieve what I was looking for by giving volume to my eyelashes and maintaining them for hours and hours, this  product highlighted my look, I looked beautiful for hours and hours my relatives looked at me and said wao today you have something shocking in your eyes you look more beautiful and with more attractive eyes I love this mask for me I recommend it with my eyes closed you have to have it in  your makeup for the better without hesitation for a second I want it",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing wand design and mascara formula,astephens12,6 Sep 2020,I absolutely love this mascara and the wand design is amazing! The flat side lifts and loads on the mascara while the bristles side does a fantastic job separating the lashes so there is no awkward clumping. The mascara goes on so smooth and the color is just perfect!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Awesome,Luanali,5 Sep 2020,"One of the best masks I've tested lately. The packaging is beautiful, the dynamic applicator lengthens and bends the eyelashes. Really md surprised.

,CaitlinBFoster,5 Sep 2020,I thought this product was amazing. I love the fact that it feels super high end without having that high end price tag. The fact that it allows you to lengthen and thicken your lashes all in one wand... just... amazing.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
LOVEEEEE,ShaeDollFace,5 Sep 2020,I tried the Pillow Talk mascara and OMG! Loveeee. Okay so I have NO lashes at all and this GAVE ME LASHES!! I didn‚Äôt even have to use a curler before hand so imagine when I do! And this is ONE SWIPE! I like how it‚Äôs flat on one side to spread the product and then you use the brush to lift. Definitely different! I struggle finding mascara that lasts and gives me all day lift and this did it!!  I think I found my new fave!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
love it,MissLysLys,5 Sep 2020,I love this mascara. The mascara is officially one of my favorites now. It gives a bold yet simple look. The volume and definition is crazy! I don‚Äôt any falsies with this mascara. I love the flare the mascara gives me. It gave my lashes volume and length. The packaging is super cute and girly. I love the light pink and gold on the tubing. They combine well together. I love the dual sided load and comb wand that gives an extra flare.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,liss5502719,5 Sep 2020,this mascara is not my favorite but not the worst. Using this applicator is very challenging. It feels as if it does not comb through it just keeps getting thicker and thicker.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,EnjoyedBree,5 Sep 2020,"I actually really like this Mascara. It goes on smoothly, and makes my eyelashes look naturally long. The brush is pretty interesting too, you just have to be sure you take off the excess mascara from the brush. If you don't take off the excess, then your eyelashes will have A Lot of excess mascara. But I like how it looks on my eyelashes, and how if you apply it generously then you get the full effect push up. And I like how it really did lift my eyelashes. This was my first time trying it, so I'm unsure if it does make your eyelashes longer.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,sdesloov7,5 Sep 2020,This mascara lasted all day and have my lashes much needed volume,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing,chelsmp93,5 Sep 2020,This is now officially my FAVORITE mascara. My lashes are so full and long they look fake lol it didnt take me 15 times to get the length I want which is awesome. MY new go to!!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Love it!!!,cassmarie17,5 Sep 2020,"I received this is part of a complementary voxbox. 
Although Charlotte Tilbury is very expensive the price is very fitting of the quality of the product. I highly recommend this",Tilbury,Mascara,No
My new go to,priincess1955,5 Sep 2020,Love this mascara. For me it does everything it said it would. One application made my eyelashes look like I had curled them and added length.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,jfbehxic2056783,5 Sep 2020,Great product but not worth the price. Does everything that it says it will do. Formula is awesome. I just think drug store mascara has the same quality.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Great Mascara,emmalee18,5 Sep 2020,I received this product free from Influenster to review and I loved the packaging and it made my lashes look natural but glam at the same time and I really loved the look it gave me.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,MyleneKarina,4 Sep 2020,I was hoping for big things from this mascara but it didn‚Äôt live up to the hype. :(,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Good!,acade32,4 Sep 2020,I like this! It‚Äôs good for volume and length and the brush is smaller and rubber so you can get to the root of lashes easier. Nice product,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,smoooo,3 Sep 2020,I love this mascara! I bought a mini size because I was tired of buying mascaras that I didn‚Äôt like and this was very surprising to me that I liked it instantly upon first try. The formula glides on easily but it isn‚Äôt super wet like all new mascaras are (and I hate Liquidy formulas anyway). This texture feels like a mascara that you‚Äôve had for a few weeks and the formula finally starts to stiffen and look good. I actually bought this because of a comment I read about this with someone who stated the same thing..  and they are 100% correct!! I wore it all day without any flaking or smudging. It was Black and matte. It won‚Äôt give you giant thick lashes like you might get from too faced better than sex. I‚Äôm looking for more of a fluttery natural length and volume look and this is what it‚Äôs for. It would probably be hard to layer over and over due to the bristles being so close together on the brush. I would say the bristles ‚Äúcomb‚Äù through your lashes more than deposit heavy amounts of liquid. I seriously love this mascara and I‚Äôm excited I‚Äôve found this to replace the roller mascara from benefit!!!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
simply perfect,GabbyT0423,3 Sep 2020,"Sooo my older sister just happened to purchase this recently and I just happened to try it when she wasn‚Äôt home and OMG I‚Äôm buying my own darn tube now because this stuff is incredible!!! First of all the brush is perfect for any eye shape, it‚Äôs light weight and this product does not get over loaded on the brush at all so you‚Äôre left with a clean application that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt clump or make your lashes look like spider legs. And you don‚Äôt even need an eyelash curler!!! It‚Äôs absolutely perfect!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,kimbo322,3 Sep 2020,love this mascara it really keeps your lashes curled and adds lots of volume.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Amazing!,MDeol817,3 Sep 2020,I am always on the lookout for the next best mascara and this hits the mark!  I am very impressed with how long and thick my lashes look after applying.  Will definitely purchase again!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Meh.,mavencindy,3 Sep 2020,Not impressed with thickening or lengthening.  Nice definition but that‚Äôs it. The brush is complicated and doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúload em up‚Äù like it should. Save your money and get a different mascara.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Push em up!,lindsaydeenicol,2 Sep 2020,Love this mascara. Really great for picking up every lash and can do a good bottom lash without clumping. very similar to Glossiers lash slick. But one thing....get a volume mascara to add on top for the best full lash!!! (i use marc jacobs velvet noir or pat mcgraths ),Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Lash extensions?  No, just this fab mascara!",jjsodapop,2 Sep 2020,"I just happened to be at my local Sephora store on the day this was launched, so I thought I would give it a try and see if it lived up to the hype.  It did!  I have the most skimpy, short lashes ever and just one coat of this mascara made my lashes pop with NO CLUMPS.  Love it;.  I was wearing it today and my mom thought I got my lash extensions put back on.  She didn't believe me when I told her it was just one coat of this mascara.  Now, she is ordering it!  You have to get used to the unique brush, but it's not difficult.  Just a bit of practice and you will be hooked.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
AMAZING,Zakiyyah99,2 Sep 2020,This mascara is great!!! I really do think the influencers reviewing this product are not using it correctly. You have to use the flat side to literally push up your lashes and then comb them through with the bristles and OMG your lashes will look so good. It gave me a lot of lift and volume! Will be buying again.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
Made my lashes droop,JEL17,2 Sep 2020,I really wanted to love this so badly but it‚Äôs a big NO for me. This totally made my lashes drooped down. They could not stay up. I tried building it and it made it worse. I agree that you can build it without the clumps but that‚Äôs about it. My lashes are heavy and it‚Äôs hard to find a mascara that will hold my lashes up. I think only water proof mascaras will work best on me.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,gotsomepipes,1 Sep 2020,"This mascara is doing the opposite of what it claims to do. My lashes are weighed down, clumpy, and can‚Äôt maintain curl with this on. I‚Äôm glad that I tried the travel sized one first because it didn‚Äôt work out.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Glam Lashes!,eyereenie2,1 Sep 2020,"First of all...really really nice mascara. I don‚Äôt curl my lashes, and have naturally long somewhat full eyelashes already and this mascara made them look gorgeous! Very volumizing indeed! I think I need to play with it a little more to get the separation with the brush if that‚Äôs even possible, as I found it to clump the ends of my lashes. I took one star off because this mascara is very difficult to remove with cleanser. It‚Äôs very water resistant and I‚Äôve lost some of my lashes trying to wash this mascara off. What‚Äôs weird is that as water resistant as it is, I still found that I had mascara transfer to my lower lash line beneath my eyes for what‚Äôs known as the dreaded raccoon look. I‚Äôm going to play with it a little more to see if perhaps my breath underneath my mask is causing this issue. I need to know if this mascara is going to replace my favorite mascara by ilia!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
AMAZING!!!,halleJeanlacey,1 Sep 2020,This is the best mascara I have ever used I didn‚Äôt even have to use my lash curler!!!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,Justwatchin,31 Aug 2020,So I watched some videos before purchasing and it appeared everyone who applied it had perfectly curled lashes after using; sounded like a win. Nope. I even curled my lashes before using and they still fell with this mascara within a few minutes. I‚Äôm glad I purchased the mini but honestly I have little luck with Charlotte Tilbury anything.,Tilbury,Mascara,No
,momtwotigg98,30 Aug 2020,"Very impressed.  This mascara stays put, eyelashes don‚Äôt droop and no eye irritation.  I also noticed did no take take but 2 coats, saw a difference after even 1 coat.  I am very happy and will buy again.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,davv4477,30 Aug 2020,"Amazing mascara!!! Must buy. Better than the pat mcgrath mascara for sure. Out of all mascaras I‚Äôve ever tried, this is the best one",Tilbury,Mascara,No
,glendaself,29 Aug 2020,Best Mascara ever!! You don‚Äôt apply like normal mascara..... you use the flat side to load the lash line and the brush side to brush thru the lashes!,Tilbury,Mascara,No
"Long, thick, and separated!",BrittanyJade,29 Aug 2020,"I know this has been getting mixed reviews on the internet; with some influencers saying that it‚Äôs terrible.. but I tried it for the first time yesterday and was SUPER impressed. My lashes looked insanely long, thick and separated. The brush is definitely unique, therefore there‚Äôs a slight learning curve. But after applying correctly, I fell in love. Mascaras are definitely a very personal thing- some work better than others for different people depending on your natural lash type, and how you like your lashes to look. I‚Äôd say get the mini, try it, and see if it works for you. I love it!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Impressed!,caitguy,28 Aug 2020,"Really did not know if I would like this- I don‚Äôt like overhyped products and usually prefer a bristle brush for mascara. HOWEVER, I have to say this mascara is super creamy, applies evenly, and gives me a beautiful winged effect. The brush is odd at first, but I actually really like the paddle concept. Get the mini if you‚Äôre not sure! Charlotte does it again for me!",Tilbury,Mascara,No
Really light and builds great,sedonath,27 Aug 2020,"I really like this mascara. It is super light, and builds really well. Never have liked either of CT other mascara, but this one it really good",Tilbury,Mascara,No
best mascara,sabrinacasto97,27 Aug 2020,"This is honestly the best mascara I've ever used. It really lengthens my lashes, and holds the curl! I actually dont have to curl my lashes before or after application like I normally would. The wand is really interesting its flat on one side and has bristle on the other side, the formula is not very wet like most new mascaras are, usually I prefer an older drier mascara because it does a better job of coating my lashes, this mascara is a drier formula that really is my new favorite. This is a must try.",Tilbury,Mascara,No
