,"The color is flattering, but the product is poor quality, the applicator head fell off after one use and it doesn‚Äôt keep the lips hydrated for very long",ShadowCP,30 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,i love this product so much! gives my lips the beautiful shine and a tint that lasts basically a stain while moisturizing!  wish it wasn‚Äôt so pricey but i do like it! second time buying and will buy again,Jennied68,17 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
DRY,Got this on an impulse buy and it wasn‚Äôt worth it. Wish I would have gotten the mini to try bc this makes my lips so DRY. It‚Äôs a shame because it is pretty on the lips. I now put Vaseline on first it kinda helps,DanaAlexis,17 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Great!,"Maybe overpriced, but it leaves the feel I was looking for not drying after use.",penhtl,16 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Nice shade but formula/packaging needs work,"Applicator is tiny + almost all lip oil comes off before it‚Äôs out of the bottle = putting it on takes forever. Dries my lips, kinda sticky, and comes off in big flakes. Also this weird stuff growing in it now.",EGJRon,13 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Holy grail,I absolutely love this lip oil. It is so hydrating and I barely have to re-apply because the color and hydration lasts SOO long!! I‚Äôve had 2 already.,JulieWawa,2 Jan 2025,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I love this product, and it really compliments my skin color.",lipglosslover2,27 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Allergic Reaction,Never had an allergic reaction to anything beauty product related except this lip oil. My lips broke out in itchy painful pustules. One of the worst experiences I‚Äôve had. Had to go to urgent care with was so bad!,braAa24,26 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
get the full size,if you are thinking about getting the mimi just get the full size it is worth it!,bmw04,25 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs an okay product,The pigment almost separates from the base and settles at the bottom and I really struggled to mix the pigment together. It is not hydrating as Dior lip oil and makes my lips crusty. It‚Äôs just an okay product and i would never repurchase again.,kushalini,25 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Best lip oil I've tried,My literal FAVOURITE. Nothing I have tried compares. The texture is so nice and not sticky at all. It has a bit of a tint too so the colour stays after the shine/gloss wears off. So pretty.,willowcasper,24 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Shimmer!,She‚Äôs is shiny! love the way it feels and it lasts a loooong time!,Saint4ddie,21 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Obsessed!,Obsessed and buy over and over again!!! I love this lip oil,,16 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Just okay‚Ä¶,"The color is nice‚Ä¶ but the applicator is very skinny so if you have plumper/fuller lips then you‚Äôll be annoyed. Personally, I‚Äôd spend the extra $12 to get the Dior one. No matter how many times I try to find it cheaper dupe - never works out.",Dasia926,15 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not worth it,I think this oil actually pulls moisture out of my lips. It creates a layer of skin on my lips that just about falls off on it own. I would never repurchase this product.,tessnelson,14 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
So Pretty,"The glossy shine and the finish are so perfect. The tint is natural looking, nothing too extra. This lip oil instantly adds the prettiest tint of color to my lips. It doesn't feel super sticky.",jackiem15,6 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Could be a lot better.,"I‚Äôm giving this product one star for pigmentation and one star for formulation. While it‚Äôs hydrating, it could be much better‚Äîit‚Äôs a bit sticky. The applicator is nice when it‚Äôs outside the bottle, but when pulling it out of the tube, a lot of product flicks off, which is frustrating. At this price point, I expected more. I really wanted to love it! I‚Äôve tried many lip oils, and honestly, Ulta‚Äôs brand performs better than this.",alexxis325,3 Dec 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Must have for on th go glam,"One of my favorites for pigmented gloss, love it and need more.",,29 Nov 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
best lip oil i‚Äôve tried so far! new staple :),"i got this lip oil in the shade primary! i‚Äôve been using it for a little bit, and i can confidently say i LOVE it. things i love:

- i can vouch for this particular shade. it‚Äôs BEAUTIFUL - it shows up as a pink with a hint of red, just like the description promised. fairly pigmented!!
- the applicator is a good size and is cushy
- the formula is the perfect consistency: not too thin and not too thick! thin enough if you tilt the bottle it shifts quickly so you can reach more as you go through it, but thick enough it‚Äôs glossy and still lasts a bit/doesn‚Äôt just sink in super quickly. also not super sticky
- it does leave a little pink stain behind like other reviews have mentioned! it‚Äôs pretty subtle, but it‚Äôs there. 
- i have personally not had any problems with leaking or the applicator breaking (i could‚Äôve just been lucky though)
- i can take or leave fragrance (don‚Äôt really have a preference), but this one has none, so it‚Äôs great for anyone who‚Äôs particular with or sensitive to fragrance 
- pretty hydrating too overall!
i‚Äôve tried a fair amount of lip oils (clarins, milani, dior, etc), and i can say this is actually my favorite! i love how this is ‚Äúone and done‚Äù - it gives a tint also with a gloss, and it stains; it makes it more convenient. it does look great with a lip liner too, though, but it also looks great on its own which is nice. it is a bit pricy (not compared to the dior though), but if you‚Äôre willing to splurge, please buy it! it‚Äôs great! hope this helps :)",comidi,26 Nov 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love this! Like Korean Stains,I love this! It applies like some Korean lip stains I‚Äôve tried. It goes on like a non-sticky gloss but leaves a very nice stain. It looks natural and doesn‚Äôt fill in all the little lines on my lips or bleed to just the rim of my lips. I‚Äôm buying more   shades!,josiexjellybean,12 Nov 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
all time favorite,This lip oil is incredible‚Äîdefinitely my all-time favorite. Amazing in every way!,snsiissnbesj,8 Nov 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Added to my regime!,"I am just loving the finish and the glossy shine.
Texture is so smooth! I think i chose the best lip oil for myself .",Kanwar94,7 Nov 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Stopper Issue with Applicator,"Super cute product on the lips. I love the color and formula. However, when I used it for the 4th time, the applicator fell off the wand because the stopper is too strong. You have to pull it out so hard that product goes flying too. I would say it‚Äôs just this one I got that was defective, but the travel/mini size is the same.",hca1023,4 Nov 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,it's keeps your lips hydrated and lasts a while. it's great for everyday wear.,Anayaliz,31 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
best lip oil on the market,I love these for when I don‚Äôt want something as heavy as a gloss or balm but still want something hydrating. The subtle tint that the shade secondary leaves is so cute!! You also get a TON of product in these. Totally worth the money for me,francescapolino,31 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Love the finish and colors! Unfortunately the applicator broke off inside the tube üò™,ap22,26 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
great,really nice lip oil. I love how cushy it feels on my lips. would totally buy again.,trapped,26 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I like this lip oil. It gives a nice color. Usually, pH-reactive products don‚Äôt look good on me, but this one is beautiful. The oil moisturizes my lips and gives a lovely shine. There‚Äôs no fragrance. The only thing is that the applicator is too big for the packaging, making it hard to pull out of the opening.",Weismannk,26 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not at all worth the price,"Not even a horrible product, just extremely underwhelming for a $36 lip oil. Applicator is not great and you have to dip it in many times to get enough product. The colour is EXTREMELY subtle on tanned skin so all the shades basically look the same. Formula is okay but really nothing special at all.",AnnikaDuggal,20 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Almost perfect...,This product would get 5 stars if it didn't leak so bad. The shade is perfect and even when the gloss wears off you still have perfectly tinted lips. Praying this company fixes the leaking issue!,pliwczak,19 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Will repurchase!,So far I have been loving this lip oil! It‚Äôs glossy with a nice amount of sheer color. It‚Äôs not too sticky & the packaging/applicator is great.,anyab16,16 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Must have,My favorite one by far out of the three that I currently have. The sheer orange  complements any skin tone. A must buy,Baileysface,15 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I love her lip oils, best ones hands down, I have a few. The applicator is a perfect size, the oil goes on smooth definitely need to have at least one shade in your make up bag.",Baileysface,15 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
In love!,"I was lucky enough to be gifted and try out the PHD Hybrid Lip Oil in the shade clear, and I am in love! This product is not sticky or tacky at all, and super moisturizing. 10/10 recommend üòá",marleymalesevic,14 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Hydrating with a great sheer color,"i have both Primary and Secondary.  I love the sheer tone of these. They add just a hint of color without being crazy, definitely good for those no makeup, makeup days. But you can also dress them up and pair with a lip liner, or lipstick to pack a punch! I need to keep one in my purse and at my vanity. So hydrating and smooth!",Emmar64,12 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Such a Great Lip Oil,This lip oils is amazing! it leave a super light flush of color while not being sticky and almost plumps! i‚Äôm obsessed!!,SofiaR1234,11 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Sticky, tacky and drying","I found this product to be sticky and tacky. It didn't moisturize or hydrate, but actually made my lips dryer after wearing all day. It smells like chemicals and for such a high price, wasn't up to standard.",KingsQueen2024,8 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A must have in your makeup bag,I got a small mini as gift and well in love immediately! So much I have bought 3 full size different colors! It‚Äôs a soothing lip oil. Has a lite glossy feel but not like a traditional gloss. Love it!!!,annamn,6 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"This is the second lip oil I‚Äôve gotten of this brand and I LOVE BOTH! The formula is not stick and looks amazing over a lip liner or even just alone, my fav!",Kam2701,6 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Meh gloss,"I wanted a hydrating lip oil, but what I got was more like a gloss. It feels sticky when I apply it, and the stickiness gradually fades away. The color is nice at first, but it seems to fade along with the stickiness. I have dry lips and was looking for something hydrating, but this product doesn't seem to provide that.",alltheworld,3 Oct 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
best lip oil!!!!,"no joke this is the best lip oil at sephora!! super glossy, hydrating, and it changes color according to you ph!! have already repurchased twice and even got one for my sister for her birthday! we both love it so much ‚ù§Ô∏è",sheisanicon,29 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Beautiful lip oil,I love the feel of this lip oil! And the color is beautiful!! I really like that it‚Äôs not sticky either. Also there is a slight color change when you wear it.,ikandibybrandie,27 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
So hydrating and juicy on the lips!,I love this lip oil. It‚Äôs my favourite. It‚Äôs not sticky it‚Äôs pigmented and it feels so hydrating and juicy on the lips. Absolutely recommend!,makeupforme34,25 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Trash!!,Got this as a gift and the tip fell off after using it once. Went to replace it at the store and they would not let me without a receipt. I didn‚Äôt have one and neither did my bf who used cash.,KateAnnlyn,24 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
The color is not flattering at all,"I got the pink tint as part of the set, and boy is this color weird. The oil itself feels nice and moisturizing, but pink tint looks so fake, I don‚Äôt know how it can look good on anyone, it looks like cheap kids makeup.",AllJ,23 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
No for me,I love haus labs products. But the phD tinted lip oil wasn‚Äôt for me. Mine had a weird odor and color wasn‚Äôt flattering with my skin tone Ôøº,cyli0420,21 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love it,Gifted by Haus Labs. Love this lip oil. Very juicy and love the shade!,jap1999,18 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Beautiful color on this Lip Oil. It makes my lips look so juicy and fresh. Does not have a plumping formula which I love. Too bad the formula is not as clean.,MadaG,15 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Ah-Amazing!,"Game changer! The Sheer Pink tone changes depending on your lips, mine turned into a ver beautiful rose natural color. The more you apply the more intense the color becomes. Definitely hydrating and long lasting. I like reapplying for fun, but definitely noticeable when I overdo it.",Craigy09,12 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Must have from Hausw lab!,Just love this lip gloss I can‚Äôt get enough!! Ready to order more,krystina1114,11 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
One of my fav lip oils,I love this lip oil. I love the way it feels on my lips and the hint of color. It‚Äôs not sticky and does feel hydrating.,CynthiaB331,9 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Skip this one,Meh. It‚Äôs not great. Doesn‚Äôt go on nicely. Doesn‚Äôt last at all. Not moisturizing. Looks like you sucked on a Cherry popsicle. I‚Äôm glad I tried it and I won‚Äôt be buying again.,lisamgb,9 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Color lasts for hours!,"I read seven negatives reviews about packing breaking, product leaking‚Ä¶ no issues here. The color lasts for hours but doesn‚Äôt have as much slip as the Clarins lip oil. If you prefer lasting color this is it!",viable,6 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Very Middle of The Road,"I used this lip oil everyday for 3 months, the experience was only okay. I found this to be a sticky formula, more similar to a gloss than a lip oil. I tried very hard to like this product but it was not for me. The applicator is very small compared to most other lip oils, which made the experience of using it very annoying. I would have to dip into it at minimum 5 times to receive the thickness I wanted from this lip oil. I also found the smell of this oil to smell like chemicals, and linger for a while after application. I do believe that this product does what it says, but it is not the most practical or luxurious experience for the price point. There are many better options out there especially for the cost.",leeleeb03,5 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
love it so much,I absolutely love this Haus Labs lip oil. It's so glossy and lightweight but not sticky at all. It hydrates my lips so much and makes my lips look super plump. It's super comfortable on the lips and this is one of my go to lippies. Definitely worth repurchasing,suyaolee,4 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Glossy not sticky,I got the clear shade to try. This is a true lip oil. Not sticky and very soft and oily. Leaves a beautiful shine on lips. This is not ph changing as what I thought it was going to be maybe because of the name this is truly clear. I tried it alone and also topped it on a lip stain and it wore beautifully both times. The applicator is a little stiffer than other lip oils I‚Äôve tried like the clarins or elf. For $25 US I think you can get something similar for cheaper but this is nice and would like to see how their pigmented lip oils would look.,nCaila,4 Sep 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I honestly really like this oil and I‚Äôve used a lot of lip oils. It looks different on everyone and it‚Äôs always the most perfect shade. My mom and I both wear this tint and it looks completely different but both of us but equally pleasant,ddhh01,31 Aug 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Allergic reaction beware!,"I loved this lip oil: it was moisturizing, glossy, and not too sticky. I loved it so much that after I used it all up I bought another one. That was a huge mistake because I developed a severe allergic reaction! My lips were peeling and my skin had painful rashes. It's been weeks and I'm still dealing with it :(",realdiva0,30 Aug 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I use this product almost every day and my lips looks really great. Love this product and love this brand.,patesgram,24 Aug 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"Amazing product , but not as pigmented as it looks.",,23 Aug 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Good quality but grew mold,"After using this product for a few months, I noticed mold, started growing inside the gloss, very disappointed.",cmaddie365,22 Aug 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
My all time fave lip oil,"The package is beautiful I love it ,Beautifully formulated lip oil. Barely feels like it's on your lips but leaves them super moisturized. This particular one tints the lips so pretty. 
 My all time fave lip oil, I love how it leave a tint when the gloss is gone. This is not sticky and looks fabulous! ""Gifted by hauslabs""",skincarevibes,21 Aug 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
SOO good,"This is a Ph color changing lip oil. It‚Äôs feels so nice in the lips- no stickiness or that weird dry residue on your lips after wearing it for a while. The color pay off is amazing, but not an overbearing pink: still natural!!!!",NinaTheRatita,19 Aug 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A Must Have,"I have tried so many lip oils trying to find the perfect natural, plump, glossy lip and have yet to find any, until I tried this. I originally set out to buy the gisu lip oil only to hear it tastes like honey. I was then scouring Sephora for a good quality lip oil in the $25 and under range. An employee suggested this one and I have never been happier with a purchase. I 100% recommend!",JAPrez,9 Aug 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
My holy grail lip oil,"This is my favorite lip oil of 2023 and now 2024! It‚Äôs so good, my mom is also obsessed with it now. It definitely lasts only a few hours, like most glosses but its such a non sticky formula and the color is so nice!",BanCutie,7 Aug 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Never living without this!!,"No doubt the best lip oil I have ever tried, and I‚Äôve tried a lot! Everything about it is perfection if you don‚Äôt have this you definitely need to try it!!!",Apricot111,5 Aug 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
milk taste,idk something is weird about this oil. it‚Äôs hydrating and all but it has an extremely off putting taste. it has a milk taste,rxbvenchy,29 Jul 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Beautiful color and I enjoyed the texture. Pricey for its wear which is to be expected.,queenin420,23 Jul 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love,"I haven‚Äôt worn lip gloss in years since I really dislike the sticky feeling.  This oil can be a bit sticky at first but once rubbed in feels more like chapstick.  I love the color and the fact that it stains my lips.  I would
 buy again.",librarachelann,23 Jul 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Product separating,"Love this product, but it the pigment completely separated from the oil! I don‚Äôt know if this has happened to anyone else.",valeria4pg,23 Jul 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not impressed,"I ended up returning it. The small applicator was a bit annoying to use, and the lip oil didn‚Äôt wow me. It leaves a pink tint that looks kind of cheap once it dries. Overall, it wasn‚Äôt great and didn‚Äôt stand out.",alenagudanets,19 Jul 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Don‚Äôt waste your money,"Save your money! This lip oil smells disgusting, and the taste it leaves on your lips literally makes me nauseous. The applicator is way too small in my opinion, and the packaging as a whole feels cheap. The closer is fine, it looks okay, but doesn‚Äôt last long and doesn‚Äôt give a super moisturized feeling either. Would definitely stay away.",GWH0111,18 Jul 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A new staple!,"This product came in my ‚Äúsephoras favourites‚Äù bag and I can see why! The colour is perfect, not to bold but just a little pop! I feel like it makes my lips look a little fuller as well. Definitely adding this to my morning routine!",Kat1794,18 Jul 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
you need this,"this product is amazing ! i got it in a sephora favourites set, it‚Äôs not sticky at ALL, it‚Äôs beautiful and it actually feels amazing on my lips.",rileyf6,13 Jul 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Wouldn‚Äôt repurchase,It was nice but not worth the price. It also went bad after a short period of time and the smell was rancid.,Ang178,10 Jul 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

My ride or die lip product,"I loved this, it has a nice wide applicator. Doesn‚Äôt get sticky and has a very nice semitransparent color and shine effect without the weight of lipgloss. I‚Äôd highly recommend.",caro9d,22 Jun 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Love the subtle color and texture. It‚Äôs not too sticky and feels good. Just wish it lasted a little longer on my lips.,Beautygirl876,16 Jun 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not worth it,"I like how this lip oil feels on my lips and gives a nice shine, but it‚Äôs not hydrating and takes forever to get something out of it since it‚Äôs so small. It‚Äôs not worth $16.",kianar0d,16 Jun 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"THE LIPGLOSS ITSELF IS NOT WORTH IT!!!! the lipgloss looks like it filled inside the whole little square but once u open it make bubbles, u realized it is LITERALLY the size of a mini perfume sample!! it is so little filled and the r hairs on it get into ur mouth. otherwise the lip gloss is fine",daisyshin18,5 Jun 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"i didn‚Äôt love nor like this one. the lip oil itself felt really weird, it smelled terrible, and the packaging overall feels really cheap. wouldn‚Äôt recommend",mikey004,4 Jun 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Oh my goodness so GoodÔøº,"It has a beautiful tent, but it‚Äôs still mild. I want the big one. The small one is tiny but mighty go by right now and makes my lips not crusty my friends keep on complementing my lips lips on how good they look. Ôøº",ctleaxiarse,31 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Best lip oil,This is the best lip oil that I have used. I layer it over a tinted balm. It has just the right shine without feeling too sticky. It makes my lips soft. I have this in two colors and like Primary the best.,limeade,26 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs good but expensive,This product is good but expensive. There are many other lipglosses that are just as good but cheaper.,oceanxo,26 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Has No Flavor or Tint,"I've been using this for almost a month, and I'd just like to note that it has NO flavor or tint. It does make my lips shiny and smooth, though!",AllyVlogs,24 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I wish the consistency was a bit thicker. I‚Äôm still rating then 5 star for the clean product.,Anasheh,23 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Beautiful product, but went rancid very quickly","So, I LOVED this product when I got it. It made my lips look and feel amazing. It was going to be my new go-to. About 90 days after purchasing it, it started to smell very weird. And the formula started looking very cloudy. Then I started seeing black stuff in the tube, which was actually the black rim to the tube coming apart and falling into the tube. The smell continued to smell worse and worse, and I threw it out.

I emailed their customer service, and they basically said, ""It must be contaminated"" and told me how to use lip gloss as if I'm not a 41-year old woman who's used lip gloss for 30 years. The product was rancid....and a lip gloss really should last more than 90 days.

I wanted to love this brand, but I will never spend another cent on a a Haus Labs product.",jellybean709,17 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
BEST LIP OIL ON THE MARKET,"I LOVE IT!

It‚Äôs a beautiful and natural color. I‚Äôve had many lip oils including the Dior one and it does not compare. It‚Äôs not sticky, it‚Äôs light weight and it has a barely-there feeling.",vnxgn,15 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Must have inside a handbag,"Best thing for very dry lips like mine. Don‚Äôt dry out the lips, yet gives a subtle pigment as i have pigmented lips",teju1255,10 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Kinda sticky,"Kinda sticky, a little too thick and gloss like for my taste in lip oils. Usually that means super shiny but it isn‚Äôt unless you really layer it on. Just okay but I‚Äôll use it, won‚Äôt repurchase",coreynicola,8 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Amazing!,"Love this lip oil! The pigment is not super opaque but not sheer, just a happy middle that I love! It is non-sticky and feels super comfortable on the lips. I think however compared to other lip oils, you aren't getting the longevity and lasting power on the lips. It dries quite quickly, but I think especially for the price it is still worth buying.",BambiTessia,5 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I wanted to like it because I‚Äôve been waiting to buy it for so long üò≠ but I had to reapply it a lot and still dried my lips. I had to return it :(,suzannacm,4 May 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Hydrating tinted glossy oil,"I loved the clear Haus Labs lip oil that was gifted to me by Sephora‚Äôs Beauty Insider Community so much, I bought another in pink! Primary is lightly pink tinted, hydrating, glossy and long wearing. Perfect for a fresh, daytime look, or over lipliner. Leaves a very faint, pink stain on lips. I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.",sister13,29 Apr 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Not worth the 16 dollars. I like buying minis so I can try them out before purchasing the bigger one. It‚Äôs super sticky. At least it was for me.,Ryanne05,29 Apr 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Everyday Gloss !,"Lip gloss fanatic here. And I can say that I am obsessed with this lip oil 10 out of 10. Definitely recommend I love the shine. It‚Äôs not sticky and it‚Äôs very lightweight. There is also a hint of a cooling sensation but that could just be me, if you‚Äôre looking for a good gloss with good quality, I suggest this one.",MoniLue,27 Apr 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

"Definitely what it advertises, but tastes horrid","I do enjoy this lip oil, however with one major caveat (at least to me). That being, that it tastes horrible. Now I know you are not supposed to eat it, and I am not, however if you happen to lick it or it gets onto a glass you are drinking from and then you take a sip, you will likely get flooded with a gross almost plastic taste. I love the color it gives and how non-sticky it is, but the fact I have to fear getting it in my miuth is a bit of a bummer for me",Tethys24,6 Apr 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
It's a no for me,No color. If I wanted something that appeared clear on my lips I would have purchased clear gloss. The pictures they show are misleading as to how much color this will provide.,kirstibeth,6 Apr 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,"One of the standout features of this lip oil is its versatility.

Plus, its non-sticky texture ensures that it feels comfortable and weightless on the lips, giving you a luxurious wear experience without any tackiness.",Carnis,6 Mar 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"This product is not my fave from this brand, elevated price for what you get (quantity and quality). However, leaves a nice tint on the lips that becomes more vibrant over time. Feels very nicely on the lips but doesn‚Äôt stay for long.",Melooo12345,4 Mar 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Disappointing,"I bought this trio because I‚Äôve heard great things about this product, and wanted to share it with the fam. I really wanted to like this, but I can‚Äôt.

I love this,"I love this product very much, I have bought the full sized one and both the minis. Surprisingly it lasts longer then you think even for me as a person who wears this 24/7. However I have 2 slight concerns: 1 being that at this product can sometimes leak on the side when it's closed (it could be because I don't close it properly). And 2 being that sometimes the applicator brush is hard to get out of the tube and the brush hair can fall off, but that's only happened on 1 of the lip oils I purchased (it could have been faulty/deffective). But this product is still my all time favorite, I love the tint, the hydration and I believe it is a good dupe for the Dior lip oil and half the price too!",ninasl,19 Feb 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,,ivan44Life,18 Feb 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
hydrating!,"I randomly picked this up one day, and it‚Äôs been a great product. I don‚Äôt wear lipstick, i like the color of my natural lips, but sometimes they need a little oomph. This is good for more of a minimal look. I‚Äôve tried the dior lip oil and it is a sticky mess, this one actually glides on and isn‚Äôt sticky. A true lip oil. The tint is lovey and subtle and gives the perfect finish. I recommend if you just want a little color to your lips and nothing to crazy. feels like a lip oil and just glides",annieands,18 Feb 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I am on my 3rd bottle!,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this lip oil. it is not sticky, it has no smell, it‚Äôs perfect! my only complaint is the price for how small the product is. i‚Äôve restocked 3 times now within maybe 5 months so ya kinda expensive!!",bellsduh,18 Feb 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

"Great lip oil, bad tint","Now this lip oil I have it in three shades(hue, secondary and I think primary) and I hate the tint! The lip oil is super nourishing, I feel my lips moisturized with it.

Do not waste your money!,"Not at ALL worth the money. I am so disappointed. Every color is the same, no color pay off. It does not last long at all. Extremely difficult to apply and get product on the brush. I know it says mini, but they are also SO tiny.",gatesbrooklynn,2 Feb 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

"Great product, I only wish it laster longer","After using this product for 2 weeks now, this is my assessment: the color is beautiful, sheer but with enough color that you can see some redish/pinkish color on your lips. It is not sticky, which is a big plus as I have tried other oils that are too sticky. Also, the smell is faint enough to not be a problem. My only wish is that it lasted longer.",catycre,28 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Awesome Sampling of an Amazing Product!,"This Haus Labs lip oil is not only beautiful, but it has DRASTICALLY improved my lips. It is hydrating without being sticky and nourishes while you wear it. I'm glad to have bought this mini pack because I don't think I would have initially gravitated toward the colored oils, but 'Secondary' (the middle shade) has easily become my favorite lip product. I get compliments every time I wear any of these oils, and my lips are more hydrated, plump, and healthy than ever. LOVE this!",CassForTheCaps,26 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

NO COLOR,"I had been wanting to try these and finally pulled the trigger due to the colors. I was very disappointed when I looked at the tubes, but even more so once I swiped them on my hand. I cannot even see where I swiped them. No color payoff. Additionally, very small for the price. This is my first Haus Labs purchase and I am not impressed. I can get a better lip oil for $6 on Amazon.",GailinGV,24 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A love of mine‚Ä¶,"It leaves my lips hydrated and doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or heavy. I also like that it gives me a bit of a tint and no too glossy looking, but p.s. don‚Äôt leave it in the car on a hot day; It‚Äôll never stop leaking!",Layla369,24 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,"Not bad, love the thick applicator, but not my favorite formula.",briehanley,11 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
So hydrating and pretty,"I've wanted to try Haus Labs for a long time and was given this pink lip for Christmas. I deal with dry, chapped lips every winter, especially when I'm on the go using public transit in the snow and wind. So far I've worn this product a small handful of times but it has held up every time and leaves my lips feeling genuinely hydrated, I was honestly taken aback by how well it works. I find the pigment takes a bit to really show up, the first time I put it on (one coat) I barely noticed anything and assumed it was maybe too close to my natural lip colour. I find that when I apply a second coat, it really shows its colour nicely and shines well. my only real complaint with this product is I do not like the applicator, it doesn't pick up enough product despite feeling nice on the lips. Overall, love this product, and I will be trying other colours in the future.",jolteonlove,11 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Wrong color..?,Ordered a lighter shade and ended up with a way darker color than requested..,jstsphia,10 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
This lip oil is a must have for me!,"Bought the shade Hue awhile back and came back to purchase the Secondary shade recently- was delivered today. I'm a fan of all Haus Labs products I've purchased, and the lip oil is my favorite. Although it's a bit sticky, you can blot it with tissue right after applying, or if you just want to tone down the gloss level. It goes well over lipstick, and just by itself it lightly tints and brings out your natural lipshade. And...I'm just a fan of how soft my lips have been. I live in the Southwest US, so my lips are usually dry all the time. I wear the Hue shade daily, even while working from home, because it keeps my lips hydrated and accentuates my natural lip color well. I strongly recommend trying out other Haus Labs products, like their foundation and lip crayons.",mindue,10 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Thin,Very thin so the actual product does not last long on the lips. The product is also very small for the price I would not recommend this product or buy it again,mikayla9490,10 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs okay,Feels nice but there is no pigment :( I‚Äôm very disappointed because I love Lady Gaga,KyeVi,9 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Pass or return,"The first thing I noticed about this product was its minimalistic packaging, which I can totally appreciate. However, when I went to apply it to my lips, I could definitely tell I wasn‚Äôt going to like the product. The dough foot applicator isn‚Äôt soft or cushy, and the applicator itself vent when I tried to apply it to my lips. Very little product was on the applicator, so I had to dip the applicator into the bottle several times just to get any product on my lips. The formula itself isn‚Äôt like that of other lip oils. It‚Äôs runny and it taste like garbage. I expected more, but, some things just don‚Äôt work out. I am also comparing this product to my Dior lip glow oils, as well as my Fenty beauty, cherry lip oil, both of which are excellent and staples in my routine. While the Dior one has a hefty price tag, I totally feel it‚Äôs worth the buy. Fenty beauty, cherry lip oil is a little less expensive and just as good of a product, so I would recommend that over this. This is not something I will be purchasing again.",bethanyaconrad,9 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
PERFECT,I didn‚Äôt wanna buy the Dior oil so I got this one. It‚Äôs SO beautiful and not sticky. I could eat and drink and it still looks like I have lip oil on! Definitely my most compliment lip product!,BeingFR,9 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Leaves bad taste in mouth,"So got these lip oils a few weeks ago, I love the way they look on my lips but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth every time I apply it. It's almost like a play doh type taste or something. If that didn't happen I would give this five stars but because of that I'll give it just 3. I won't be purchasing again.",sarahjane1014,8 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Don‚Äôt waste your money,This product seems kind of pointless. It‚Äôs clear and doesn‚Äôt last long. Unfortunately aquaphor goes a longer way than this lip oil. The consistency doesn‚Äôt feel like lip oil either.,Sierraforrest,7 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,"Best lip oil I‚Äôve used. Moisturizers my lips. Leaves a slight stain once it wears off. The color is beautiful. It‚Äôs isn‚Äôt really orange, it seems to develop more color as time goes on. It ends up my lip color but better.",dms520,3 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"cute packaging, ok formula","to be completely honest, i was expecting more from the formula of this lip oil. it feels thin and i can really feel the dry texture of my lips. it doesn't provide a lot of moisture either or shine. i think it works well if you prep your lips before using the oil and if you want a balmier finish. to get more of a shine i have to get more product multiple times.",estherzwang,2 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,So glad to read others have the same issue. This applicator is horrible. I *think* I like the gloss but I‚Äôm not sure if I even am applying any? Nothing seems to come out onto applicator. Horrible but so far- I do like the lightweight gloss. Very subtle color.,Cheshess,2 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Definitely not worth $14,So small and the applicator is tiny too. It‚Äôs difficult to get the smallest amount of product on the applicator since the component is so small. Good product but poorly designed.,micknick1,2 Jan 2024,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love this lip oil!,"I love this lip oil. Super cute colors and very hydrating. Not as thick as the Clarins (my HG) but really nice for days when I want something lighter on my lips!

,it is an AMAZING product an it super glossy although it is kinda small it‚Äôs worth the price.(also  i accidentally bought the lip oil in clear but made it pink),fabrii,29 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
LOVE IT SOO MUCH,"This lip oil is so amazing! I love it bc it makes my lips look so moisturized and it has a cute pink tint, the application wand is nice and have a nice shape to it,sooo cute 10/10",MartinezBabyCO,29 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Pretty color,"The color of the oil is very pretty and can be noticed even after many hours. I wish it was a bit shinier, but this is a gloss, so I understand that it‚Äôs not meant to sparkle. Overall, I like it very much.",miley123elle123,29 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
An overall great product,"I loved this lip hybrid. I paired it with the Haus Labs lip crayon underneath it. It haven't lips a pretty great glow. The only thing is that I think that they should have a scent. Overall, great product.",kelly0927,27 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Used this product for a week and it completely dried out my lips!!! I‚Äôm having to use thick healing ointments to fix the issue,honeybunny21,27 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Good product. applicator need improvement,"This is a great product to try if you want to try lip oils. My only drawbacks are 1) the applicator doesn't pick up a lot of product, so you have to dip & dip multiple times to get a good coverage of product. I think the tube opening is too slim. 2) the product wears off quickly. I wouldn't say this is my holy grail lip oil.",Mk22541,24 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love this with all my heart,"For the longest time I‚Äôve had trouble finding a good lip oil shade that works well with my natural lip color. For the first time I think I‚Äôve found it! It evens out the color on my natural lips so well!! Lasts a while depending on how much you use. Taking a start off tho for how much product there actually is, wish it was a little bigger",Xochimitl,24 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Pretty pretty pretty,I like how pigmented it is. It makes my lips look healthy. Wish it came in a bigger tube. Love it.,IzzyCathy,22 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Great everyday lip product,"This is my first lip oil and I really enjoy it. It has a great shine , and isn‚Äôt thick or sticky feeling at all. You do have to reapply throughout the day as the shine wears off but it does leave a nice tint to your lips. I would try this first before buying the more costly lip oils.",Thuc95,21 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"If you don't like pink, save your green...",It doesn't really matter what color you get. They all turn pink.,cupcake30078,20 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Everyday use,I really like this lip oil! It‚Äôs not sticky at all and it stays on for a good amount of time. Although the pink looks bright in the container it‚Äôs not when you apply it. I just wish it had a better applicator.,Yeebz,18 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Absolutely disgusting,"This is absolutely disgusting, It grew mold within a week of buying. I am terribly disappointed in Haus labs because i love this brand so much and its just truly upsetting...",ellaaka,18 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
PhD Hybrid Lip Oil,"Do you have a favorite summer lippy? This is one of mine from @hauslabs in color Primary. It adjusts to your pH level and turns in to the most lovely subtle pink. It just shows off your lips in the most delicious way and simply enhances your lips. I find it a little tacky although it claims to not be sticky, and it‚Äôs uber moisturizing.

I tried it and it actually did tasted like meat. 4-5 of my friends agreed with me.",ThatKaren1,17 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"its ok, nothing special","It‚Äôs an oil-based lip balm that leaves a sheer color on the lips as it claims, nothing special. not as hydrating as a balm so you do need to re-apply this more often.",ooj4cki3oo,16 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
looks even better on,The pink shade looks so natural but pigmented on the lips! I totally adore it. It‚Äôs not the most hydrating but it does the job and isn‚Äôt sticky. I think this is a very good product.,gecgecgec,12 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Fun to try if you are into lip oils,"Pretty good. I still prefer the Dior one or Elf lip oils. 
I do notice when I swatch this on my hand the products spreads a bit, not sure if it‚Äôs a good or bad thing. I havnt notice it spreading beyond my lips. It does not leave a color. The applicator does not pick up a lot of product.",mishkhan,2 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
its not bad but its not great,"ive been using this product for about 2 weeks, and i can definitely say this is definitely one of the thinnest formulas. its non sticky compared to nyx, dior, clarins, milk and other lip oils on the market. the applicator is quite small, youll need to dip it in like 2-3 times before you can get any product on your lips. i really like moisturing products, but i cant say that this is one of them. my lips do look super smooth and silky, but after 20-30 minutes the edges of my lips are dry and i feel like reapplying again. overall a good product, but i would not repurchase.",izrenie,2 Dec 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Waste of money,Feels like a cheap thin product. It‚Äôs got a hard applicator so is tough to put on and is not particularly comfortable or moisturizing. Not crazy about the look either.,Owtornowt,29 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,No. It tastes terrible and it didn't last very long at all. The packaging was also cheap feeling. The colors are nice but just no.,mariahws93,27 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Didn't like.  This product was recommended because I was looking for something moisturizing but not sticky.  It was not sticky however it is not moisturizing. If you are looking for slight oil coverage that has no lasting effect than this is what you are looking for.,joycsie,27 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,the packaging is difficult to work with and the product is a pretty average clear gloss.,Sun1ti,26 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I love this lip oil,"I used this lip oil so much before the Dior one. If you don‚Äôt feel liking splurging on a lip oil like the Dior one, this product is for you. It has about the same effect. The applicator could be better tho.",srah8,25 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Definitely love this product only thing I wish is it had the same applicator as the doir.,tjanet31,25 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Great Lip Oil!,I was looking for a good alternative of the Dior Lip Oil because nobody wants to pay $40 for a tiny tube of oil. I came across this and absolutely loved it! Primary is the best shade imo. Will continue to repurchase.,Marelyna,23 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Nice, but I prefer a different product","I liked this lip oil. It is comfortable on the lips, and I really like the soft colors that the two that change on your lips turn in to. I do feel like I am constantly having to reapply, which I'm not a fan of. I don't know if the product sinks in quickly or if I'm rubbing my lips together too much. I prefer the Tarte Maracuja line, but it was fun to try something new. Warning, these are teeny tiny!",jenna8258,21 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I wouldn't recommend,"This was the first lip oil I've ever purchased. I was hoping for something moisturizing. this was extremely drying. I would not recommend it and hopefully I can return it. I just purchased it today, but I am unsure of the return policy at Sephora.",mph2292,20 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I think it‚Äôs an okay product,"The applicator doesn‚Äôt pick up a lot of product. In order to get some product you have to dab the applicator in the lip oil a few time. The texture of it is nice overall, very light pigment.",humblejalis,19 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Amazing product,I have been using this product for about a month and it is so hydrating and helped fix my dry lips. They are also in such good colors. I would definitely recommend and repurchase.,soccerlover25,15 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A new staple!,"Gives great colour that stains lips even after it wears off after eating or drinking. It isn‚Äôt sticky, very moisturizing and comfortable to wear. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.",kokanee,14 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Always in my purse! üëõ,Keeps lips totally hydrated with a non sticky feel and a beautiful sheer tint!,allscrewzlouz24,13 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Won‚Äôt be repurchasing,This lip oil was not hydrating by any means. It‚Äôs has an off putting scent to them. The applicator is so small. It‚Äôs actually inconvenient to use. The tint they provide is cute but that‚Äôs it the only good thing about it.,Johnnice,9 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Could‚Äôve been better. Should have bought full size,"Cute concept for a gift but these are very mini. The applicator is to big for the bottle. Product doesn‚Äôt adequately saturate the sponge. Also, these aren‚Äôt very hydrating. Go buy ELF lip oils instead.",bluekitty,8 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Haus Labs Lip Oil,After buying this product I became absolutely obsessed with the formula and appearance. This color is perfect if you want a pinky shine and a lightweight feeling on the lips. Love!,EmmaMcQuillan,8 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Perfect lip oil,I love this lip oil. It‚Äôs not super sticky goes on nicely and leaves a cute tint behind.,stephgar,7 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Daily Wear, without makeup too üëç",Amazing product. Use it daily. Just the perfect colour for with or without makeup. I think its the best lip oil in the market. There is a lip stain it too. Looks amazing. I want all colours now.,Mon30,6 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Pass on this. Smells Horrible.,"Sorry, this isn‚Äôt it. I did like texture & shine. It had a peculiar smell (both ones I tried) & literally would have lasted 4 applications max.",hotkymama,4 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Good but bad packaging,"The lip oils are very good. They have a very nice hydrating formula and I really enjoy using them. However, my only complaint is that the packaging is hard to use. The applicator is tiny so you have to dip it like 10 times to get any product",Sloane4455,4 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not worth the price.,I really wanted to like this it‚Äôs just not for my liking it‚Äôs kinda of drying and it smells weird and I can‚Äôt get a good amount the first pass. It looks very natural the packaging is nice overall.,izabella1028,4 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I just purchased this in the color ""Primary"".  It leaves such a beautiful, glossy looking shine for quite some.  After the glossiness disappears, your lips are left with a gorgeous pinkish-red tint.  It seems very hydrating so far and and is not sticky at all.  I am loving it!  I am considering getting another color.
I also have the Dior and Clarins lip oil too.  While I love my Dior lip oil, the Dior one is much stickier and thicker than the Haus Labs, so I actually prefer the Haus Labs one.  I also think it's more hydrating than the Dior..  I honestly don't care for the Clarins lip oil.  It's much thinner, not hydrating at all, and I don't care for the fruity smell and taste.  So far, the Haus Labs is my favorite!",azdoglover,3 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not a fan,Dries out my lips terribly. And the color (on me) is Barbie pink. Not a good look for me.,megmelmere,2 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Daily Go-To,"Love!! I bought the mini version in the shade ‚ÄúTint‚Äù & it feels so smooth, but not sticky. Also, after it wears off a bit, it leaves a very nice lip stain. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that the bottle itself gets dinged up and scratched really easily. I‚Äôve only had this bottle for about 2 weeks and it looks like I‚Äôve had it for a year.",Amber262,2 Nov 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Primary is my fave!",jennyv13,27 Oct 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Get the full size this is so not worth it,I saw a review before I purchased this trio set that said that you had to go in and get more product like 5 times before you had enough product on your lip. That person was right. Just get the full size instead,sourbears,25 Oct 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Ferments and smells after a few months - avoid,"Fell in love with it, but the formula spoils and ferments so badly I pitched it. Hoped this was a fluke, and purchased another and within a few months, same thing. What a waste.",vj0707,25 Oct 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Malfunction,"I love the formula of these lipgloss, however something is definitely wrong with these minis the applicator is very stiff making it hard for you to apply the product.",Maxsi,24 Oct 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Best Lip Oil,Absolutely stunning. I had the full sized one and it was almost out so I decided to get one because 1. There are 3 colors 2. They last FOREVER.

Beautiful color,I love the color it‚Äôs so beautiful and even as it wears I still feel like it looks pretty and it really lasts! My only complaint is that it makes my lips super dry (and kind of tingles) which is such a bummer because I can‚Äôt wear it daily. Not really sure what that is about or if others are finding it drying as well or it‚Äôs just me. I would still recommend to try!,mem27,22 Oct 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Not worth the money,"I am honestly disappointed in this product. The texture is so weird and it smells like chemicals. The formula is good though and lasts a long time but overall, it could be way better for Lady Gaga.",avalynn444,20 Oct 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs okay,I‚Äôm not crazy about this set. Barely any product on the wand so you have to go in at least 3 times to get enough product on your lips. There‚Äôs really nothing special about it. I‚Äôm returning this. Lawless lip set is way better in my opinion,misha93137,19 Oct 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Try it!,"I'm so excited that they did a lip set of the oils. I love how soft and moisturized they make my lips feel.

perfect for everyone,i personally have such a hard time finding the right products that will hydrate my lips (and not make them look super cakey) and that suits my skin tone. this product does both. it hydrates your lips to make them plump and then the product uses your pH to adjust the color of your lips. haha labs does it again!,annanp,16 Oct 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Awesome,This is such a beautiful color it has no smell or taste and the applicator is good. It‚Äôs moisturizing and the only bad thing about it is the application feels dry,mckenzie1015,15 Oct 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Definitely repurchasing.,"I was hesitant to buy this for a while because of the price but you get 7ml of product which is more than some other lip oils and glasses that are almost the same price. This might be my favorite lip oil formula of the 5 that I‚Äôve tried! It‚Äôs so smooth, not sticky, no taste, I think it offers a slightly cooling effect. It gently stains your lips with a soft color. Easy to remove and actually feels nourishing! Also last a long time.",ilashes,10 Oct 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

love it!,it definitely moisturizes my lips and i love the consistency of it because it‚Äôs on the thicker side but it‚Äôs very lightweight. the only reason i gave this 4 stars is because the shade i got (secondary) turns pink on my lips and i‚Äôm not a fan of pink gloss.,MackenzieLW,14 Sep 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Just Okay!,"Not a go-to for me. No good nor bad impressions- I'm just indifferent about it. The shade on it's own is ""Bleh,"" I do find on top of lipstick it's much much prettier with the sheen of the orange oil, but I don't love it enough to repurchase it.

"Seals in lip balm well, lasts a while!","It‚Äôs a great sealing oil on top of my lip balm, adding a nice hint of color. It‚Äôs not as hydrating on it‚Äôs own as I would like, however I do love it with the right combination of lip balm for deep hydration with a hint of color. The star taken off is because of the slight stickiness until it settles for a few minutes, and because it could be a bit more hydrating.

The best lip gloss I‚Äôve ever tried !!!,I am a lipgloss girlie at heart so I have a big collection. This one is above and beyond!!

Waste of money,"I love Lady Gaga but this is a waste of money. I bought the lip oil for $24 and there is barely any product. The packaging for the lip oil is 3 inches but the applicator takes up over half you could get a better lip oil and or lip gloss for much less money. As far as the product itself it‚Äôs fine I don‚Äôt dislike it but I also don‚Äôt love it and I most definitely don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth how much it costs. It advertises itself as color changing and adjusting to your PH levels, and it doesn‚Äôt do that what you see in the bottle is exactly what you‚Äôre going to get overall it‚Äôs not the worst product I‚Äôve ever tried, but it‚Äôs not worth the money for the quality of product or the amount of product.",Melialoveskat7,25 Aug 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

"Amazing formula, poor packaging for mini",The formula and color is fantastic! I wouldn‚Äôt purchase the mini size again though because the applicator is kind of annoying.

,"Was okay by itself as a slightly tinted gloss, but too cool to wear over any other lip crayon without looking weird dye to its own pigmenting. Doesn‚Äôt work for warm to neutral skin tones. This one I didn‚Äôt keep.",orangeyellow,2 Jul 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Lives up to its name.,"I tried this for the first time without reading its description. My initial expectations were, ‚Äúok, another lip oil.‚Äù I applied a generous layer toward the end of the evening, after masking and while getting ready for sleep. Since there my lips still felt covered in it an hour after applying, I decided to forego my usual sleep mask. The next morning, I was shocked to find my lips still felt as thought they had a nice slip, a thin layer of, what was it - oil? on them. I did a quick search for ‚ÄòHAUS Lip Oil,‚Äô and of COURSE.  It is aptly named ‚Äòhybrid.‚Äô",eshoe,27 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Good to gift!,I love this product and have gifted to friends because of its versatility! I will comment that it where‚Äôs off and you will need another gloss to put on top after. It does stain and doesn‚Äôt dry the lips it just doesn‚Äôt look as juicy on the lips after a while. I have been using it for a while and I will say definitely worth it if your looking for a good lip oil!,natahandjsubs,27 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Beautiful subtle color and soft lips!!,"I really like this.  Super hydrating.  Just the right amount of color.

Hydrating and smoothing lip oil!,I received this free from Sephora‚Äôs Beauty Insider Community and wanted to share my honest review. It is a Really lovely lip oil with great shine and lasting hydration. I have mostly been using as a a night time treatment and I love that it stays in all night and I wake to soft and hydrated lips that seem to stay softer throughout the day after using this at night. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have bought this clear lip oil but I‚Äôm so glad I received it and would definitely repurchase. It seems unscented and doesn‚Äôt have any tint to it. Highly recommend!,sister13,24 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

A MUST HAVE,This lip oil isn‚Äôt sticky and doesn‚Äôt taste bad. After application your lips are immediately hydrated. I love this lip oil so much!,atti5,22 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Great Product, Horrible Applicator","I really do like how the lip oil makes your lips look! It is a little to sticky for my liking, but it still does not bother me that horribly. The only thing that I cannot stand about the product is the applicator‚Äî I feel that it barely picks up the product and it‚Äôs too small and stiff that it does not smear the product well on your lips. In comparison, I love the applicator of the Dior lip oil; this lip oil has the complete opposite applicator in that it‚Äôs way small and does not bend with the shape of your lip.",typikole,22 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
My new go to lip oil!,"This is now my go to lip oil! it has a great shine and colour, lasts fairly long, and leaves a very nice tint on the lips after it has dulled down. I would easily buy this again.",Anjalic3,22 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Nice color but wonky tube,This is a really pretty color but the applicator is so hard to get out of the tube. I feel like I have to tug on it quite a bit to get it to pop out.,spicyjuniormint,22 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,"So pretty, makes lips look juicy pretty and shiny while also being hydrating‚Ä¶it lasts a while. Only thing is the applicator doesn‚Äôt reach the bottom of the bottle so I can‚Äôt get all of my moneys worth but I‚Äôd say 99/100",elochoui,20 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"Beautiful colour, really does match your skin to create the best shade. Super drying tho even when i put chapstick with it, i have really dry lips and this makes it worse. Just gonna stick to my Fenty Heat lipgloss tbh",rediate,19 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Hydrating, glossy finish, slightly plumping","I already had 2 of the Haus lip oils in my makeup collection (Secondary and Hue) before receiving Neutral, the clear version of this lip oil, as gratis. I've spent about 3 weeks testing out this lip oil (and comparing it with a couple other clear lip products, also received as gratis) and am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.   

WHAT I LIKE:
* Consistency - thinner than most lip oils, making it less sticky & tacky 
* Applicator & application - large doe foot applicator makes for quick & easy application, no mirror needed
* Wears comfortably 
* Great for quick & easy, on the go makeup (but see below) 
* Lightly hydrating
* Glossy finish 
* Slightly plumping effect, without making my lips look swollen. The  top portion of the left side of my lips is less full due to a procedure I had, but using this lip oil plumps it up slightly, enough to make it look more even with the other side of my lips. A plus for me.

AREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT: 
* I think this is supposed to be pH adjusting formula but I didn't notice any color change, just some glossiness & shine, which isn't bad at all but it doesn't provide color to my lips as the pH adjusting claim suggests it might (though maybe mine was just this way).
* Would love to see a couple more shades added to the range, maybe a sheer bronze or rose gold hue

FYI:
* Versatile - wears well on its own, paired with a lip liner, or over a lip color 
* Convenient for travel - I like to keep this in my purse, great to use for running errands on the weekend

BUY or BYE?:
* While I prefer the tinted shades from this line, I do enjoy the versatility of the clear version (see above) and the thinner consistency; it's a BUY, BUY, BUY for me. 
* Recommend",itsfi,19 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Great lip oil!,"Very hydrating and not sticky, high shine and comfortable to wear.  I removed 1 star because it doesn‚Äôt last as long as other lip oils. I did receive this complimentary from Sephora in exchange for my honest review.",faeriegirl,18 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Super hydrating,This lip oil is really hydrating. It‚Äôs not sticky at all and has a more slippery feel rather than a thick consistency. I got secondary because the other shades made my lips way too pink to what I am used to. But this left my lips with such a pretty color that looks natural. Even with lip liner or over a lipstick your lips will be hydrated for hours even after the shine has faded. Definitely recommend this shade if you‚Äôre not a huge fan of bright pink lips.,Isabella009,17 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
So pretty!!,"100% a MUST have!! Although the gloss doesn‚Äôt stay on that long, I find myself reapplying quite often",katiefrance,17 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I fell asleep in this product and the next morning woke up with bumps,jujgup,16 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Don‚Äôt waste your money,So tiny like unbelievably tiny. Product isn‚Äôt anything different and the applicator is bad it barely picked up any product at all. Get essence cranberry lip oil. not worth $20 at all.,user4646,16 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Save Your Money,"This is neither hydrating or an accurate color and I'm super disappointed. Wanted something a little different for summer and purchased Gaga's ""go-to"" only to find that there isn't really any tint at all on this because it's a ph balanced lip oil (the confirmation was Red 27 in the ingredients) and thus these shades aren't going to look much different after all. It's sticky and sits on the lips even with the lightest application. The color also seemed to turn into ""Primary"" (hot pink) after a few uses and this is overall a dud.",halcyonranger,15 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Eww,"It‚Äôs pretty ig, but tastes AWFUL!! My sister can tolerate it, but I gag every time I put it on. I just can‚Äôt, it smells like rotten milk and meat.",avivab22,15 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,I am definitely a clear gloss girly. I love a good clear gloss that will moisturize my lips. I do find this gloss does moisturize but it didn‚Äôt last as long as I had hoped. I love how comfortable it feels and it is not sticky. I will definitely grab this one in the summer but I don‚Äôt know if it will work in the winter months when my lips are terribly dry.,ather,14 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Comfortable, high shine, requires re application!","The packaging is pretty but because the cap is reflective it is finger print prone. The applicator is medium sized, but it doesn‚Äôt pick up a ton of product so you need to dip in twice for two coats to get an even layer. The packaging isn‚Äôt messy. There is no scent but there is a slightly odd taste if it gets in your mouth. The oil is fairly thin and I‚Äôd say not sticky, watery, or greasy feeling. This isn‚Äôt super long lasting (I‚Äôd say about 2 hours). When freshly applied it produces a  high shine effect and is pretty. It‚Äôs hydrating while on and doesn‚Äôt leave a tacky film after being removed. But my lips don‚Äôt necessarily feel extra nourished once it‚Äôs removed either. I would say it‚Äôs slightly plumping because of its glossy effect but not so much in the sense that you will feel a warm or cooling sensation that actually makes them bigger. It‚Äôs comfortable to wear and so cute and aesthetic on my vanity!",MarissaIwanowsk,14 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Great moisturizing product,"Very moisturizing and not sticky. At first the color is super pale but after a couple applications through the day, the color bills up to a really nice soft pink!",karencb,14 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,"I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. I was surprised at how much I actually liked this product.  I don‚Äôt think I would have ever tried anything from this brand but now I am looking into other shades of the lip oil. Usually the lip oils I have tried are not hydrating enough. This one actually made my lips feel moisturized and not sticky. It gave my lips a beautiful glossy finish but lacked the plumping effects it claims.  The wand is the perfect application size that allows enough product to go on in one coat. If you don‚Äôt want one that transforms with your lip shade, I would recommend the natural-clear shade I tried.  It stayed on comfortably for more than 4 hours without having to reapply.",SportyGirly125,6 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Not super exciting,"Hi! I am a Sephora beauty insider community ambassador and this is my honest and authentic review of this product. I like the applicator and the packaging, the actual product at least the clear version fell short for me.

The product didn't last long maybe 20 minutes without needing reapplied.",lmaster,5 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
i loveee that it doesnt feel oily,"idk why but im so obsessed with this lip oil. i like how it doesn't feel greasy or oily, it has the consistency of a gloss more than a lip oil.

no regrets.,"I have used this product until there was not a single drop left. It is extremely moisturizing, gives me a perfect tint of color that still allows my natural lip color to shine through, and gives me a beautiful gloss IH",KO55,5 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Color is nice,I like how this lip oil leaves my lips pink still even after the product goes away however it doesn‚Äôt really leave my lips that moisturized. It‚Äôs nice to use over other lip products too.,noranolan,4 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
My new favourite,I‚Äôve tried tons of lip oils and this is easily my new favourite go to and I will 100% buy more!!,Giuliaboolia,3 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Yas,"Ms Gaga doesn‚Äôt fail me, Looks really nice on me. I didn‚Äôt go for pink because it would look to pinkish on my lips, so I tried secondary and it suits me well. Very moisturizing and I love how the bottle itself removes excess from the applicator.",brandyyo,3 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Mehhhh,"its such a pretty color! it looks orange but comes out pink, but with more use the whole product becomes pink?? the applicator SUCKS and i can barely get any product out, its a copy of dior lip oil.. it feels very cheap and is just not worth your money. SAVE UP FOR DIOR!!!!!",worldwideemo,1 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Too lightweight,"This is indeed a lightweight hydration product. It did not last long on my lips and required constant reapplication. It does have a nice glossy sheen and it wasn't sticky.I found the applicator to be weird. Seems to be so you can do both lips without turning it, but neither side worked well for my lips. I received this as a gratis from Sephora and these are my honest thoughts as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.",Samtian,1 Jun 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Don‚Äôt waste the money,I wanted to love this product. I‚Äôm a huge Gaga fan. At first I loved the color. The oil is thick and has a gross taste. After a while the product gets thicker. I would never purchase this again.,Nikkid386,26 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Best lip oil ever,"Perfect lip oil, isn‚Äôt runny, not sticky or heavy, gives the perfect touch of color that matches my skin tone and makes my lips feels nourished!

Not A Fan,"I wanted to love this product. I have tried multiple times to make this work, but I can‚Äôt get past lingering smell of rotting meat that I experience every time I use it. I thought it I would just use it and it would get better, it never did.",rlbrown1501,18 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Good but not amazing,I love these lip oils they have beautiful ph reactions on the lips. They need more colors and need to make a product that doesn‚Äôt expire within 6 months of opening. I get lots of compliments on the glossy shine and fills my lip lines too. Had a bad smell after a few months indicating it had expired which for the price point is unacceptable.,queenkhia,17 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not worth it,Nothing special about the formula and it doesn‚Äôt last long on the lips. The packaging and applicator are very cheap. Not worth the money.,scgoodman92,15 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Good but not great,"I love the look of these lip oils when first applied, but after about 20 mins of wear these lip oils lose their shine so I find myself reapplying more often than I would a regular lip gloss and these are smaller than say the fenty gloss so frequent reapplication makes the product go quickly. Love the shades love the look but wish they were longer lasting. These do leave somewhat of a nice tint when they dry down.",JoceDes222,14 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
fav!,"omg!! what to say ab this product. one it goes on your lips, it almost instantly changes to the perfect colour for your lips!! i also swatched it on my hands and saw this. such a good lip oil, and even tops dior - which says something. this is a #musthave in my routine. go buy:)",graceisawesomee,13 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Decent for a first lip oil,"I've been wanting to try a lip oil for a while and wanted to try this one because of the ph affect; however, I don't think it does anything as it's already tinted but just looks like a clear gloss on my lips. It's not sticky but it's a little thick. The applicator isn't my favorite as well.",celinegee,12 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"Bias because I love Lady Gaga LOL! I love the sheerness of this gloss, it's really like a barely there pink and very glossy! Great for natural looks or to layer on a lipstick, and it does feel super hydrating! I do wish it had a little more staying power as it fades faster than I'd like for the price, but I don't mind reapplying and use it more in the daytime than a night out where I'd reapply less, don't regret buying but might not repurchase over the Clarins lip oil which has more color and is thicker in consistency (personal preference) and stays on longer in my opinion",bluenam,12 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love this,"This is the most underrated product. This is an oil, hydrates like a balm, when it wears off it just feels like I should reapply but doesn‚Äôt make my lips feel like they‚Äôre going to crack if I don‚Äôt. Plus it leaves a gorgeous tint of color",Mina512,12 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not lover lip oil,"Not lover of formula. I will past 
Not even tints lips.",hidi,12 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I think I love this?,"This is a hard one to review, because while I think this is an excellent product, it‚Äôs also‚Ä¶ weird. It goes on like a gloss, behaves like a balm, is orange in the bottle, and pink on the lips. Which is disappointing because I have a hundred pink lip glosses and balms, and zero orange ones. Pros: No stickiness, shiny but not sparkly, and feels soft and hydrating. Cons: I still wish it was orange.",jennifer98101,12 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Really liking this!,"I'm very happy with this product! I went in with an open mind and didn't fully know what I should expect. I like how the color develops after I put it on and the consistency goes from feeling like a gloss to a balm. It does stain the lips, even once its worn off, which I was honestly looking for but didn't think I could find in a product that looks so sheer in the tube. I swatched literally every lip oil in the store and this is the only one that didn't run or bleed into the lines on my hand and it hasn't done it on my lips either. As far is the color it is pretty bright on me - I'm very fair skinned with pink undertones, blue eyes, and red hair and it complements my complexion nicely. I'll def be trying the other shades as well!",Allysonn92,11 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I can‚Äôt even describe how luxurious this oil feels on my lips. It glides without feeling heavy or sticky. Still slight gloss feel mixed with an oil. I haven‚Äôt had anything like this before. Even perfect for clients who want,SassyApache,10 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
go to product,literally a fave! the only lip oil that doesn‚Äôt feel sticky and lasts for hours,peterj,10 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,Looks and feels great but leaves a disgusting taste in my mouth? Not sure if I‚Äôm the only one who experiences this but there‚Äôs something subtle and musty about it. Drives me crazy and almost can‚Äôt wear it,samanthamlamb,8 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Really nice gloss,"I really like this. However this, in my opinion, is totally not a lip oil. This is a lip gloss. It doesn‚Äôt really make my lips feel moisturized but it is a gorgeous gloss. I love the colour and the shine. So pretty",rayoflight17,8 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not what I expected,"The color of the product is more appealing than what it does to your lips. I was hoping for a pretty natural pink look but it ended up making my lips look very brown. 
Also, I would definitely categorize this as a lip gloss and not an oil.",sflork,7 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs fine,"Title says it all, keeping it bc of price. I don‚Äôt see any tint on my lips although my family says they can. I bought this on a whim, but I have a clear drugstore oil that I like more. Filter on in photo.",anabnana12,7 May 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Better than most leading brands,This was recommended to me by the Sephora associates and let me tell you they weren‚Äôt wrong. Color payoff is surprisingly amazing. My lips were quiet bright by the second reapplication after 4 hours. Super hydrating!,AMKBeauty,30 Apr 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Just ok,I wanted to love it. But it is nothing fantastic. You need to apply it at least five time to get a shiny finish. The Refy gloss is way better.,emiliareyes,30 Apr 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Together, Forever.","LOVE this lip oil. The Sephora I went to didn‚Äôt have the shade I wanted, so I took a gamble on Secondary.

Beautiful color and not sticky!,"I bought Tint and Primary. It feels amazing on my lips. Not sticky or thick. No smell. I can tell it's there without it feeling like a thick coating. I have an iconic lip oil and it's super thick and sticky. I see some people don't like the applicator, but I don't see a problem. No it doesn't pick up a lot per dip, but I'd think that's if you want a thick coating. One dip was enough for me (use both sides of the applicator), because I'm not using it as a lip gloss.",Ondraia,28 Apr 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,I am really loving this lip oil and if I apply it on top of lipstick it seems to last so much longer. also very hydrating. only complaint is that the applicator seems to get stuck in the opening quite a lot. I'd like it to be a smoother opening.,vvkitkatvv,10 Apr 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Long lasting moistures and leaves a nice tint on the lips.,Kristinaaaaaa11,9 Apr 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I love this shade,"Im a fan of this oil. It has a thicker consistency with a nice slip on the lip. The shine is glassy and it leaves an even stain that‚Äôs true to the shade on the bottle.

I'm glad I tried this before plunking down $40 for the Dior lip oil.",cutzie80,6 Apr 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
My fav!!,"Best lip oil I have tried. This shade (secondary) leaves the most natural, soft pinkish tint to my lips, which stains. Not too thick or thin, lasts a very long time. The only complaint I have is that it changes to a more hot pink shade after around 4 months of owning.",bfarrell09,3 Apr 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Feels nice - but pigment can be lacking,"Not sticky and feels nice. The colour ""hue"" has a good amount of pigment, but I find the color ""secondary"" looks like a clear gloss so I was disappointed in the amount of pigment with this shade. Otherwise a great lip gloss/oil.",BasicMakeupUser,2 Apr 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
U need this lip oil!!!,I absolutely love this lip oil. It‚Äôs much better than the dior one and it‚Äôs way cheaper. This lip oil also isn‚Äôt sticky AT ALL. It‚Äôs really a lip OIL.

Very nice,"This product was surprising as I didn‚Äôt have big expectations. I tried most of the colors in store, one was unavailable to test, and they just appeared to be a very glossy near-colorless lip product.

The color deems a little more brown or warm in the photos, but it really is just slightly orange‚Ä¶mostly clear.",sephorme,19 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Thumbs down,I agree with the other reviewers. It‚Äôs thick and not very hydrating. And the tube is small for the price point. The color is meh. I‚Äôm returning it.,AJ6904,18 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Better than Clarins comfort lip oil,"I wanted to move on from the Clarins lip oils because they don't provide that much colour and I haven't found them to be particularly long-term moisturizing. This one is much more moisturizing and has cleaner ingredients but it doesn't have much colour at all. The texture is fine, not too gloopy.

"I like it, but not very moisturizing","Bought this on a whim but I really do like it... I don't find it very moisturizing (I always use lip balm so this isn't a deal breaker) but the color is very flattering and it's not sticky.  I usually put on lip balm, blot, then line and fill in my lips with a neutral/pinky-brown liner and top it with this.  Good neutral look for business meetings and every day casual.  Looks good on its own too!  One star less for the quantity you get for what you're paying for.",Reeshyreesh,14 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

It's... ok...,"I'm an elder Millennial who doesn't always know about the latest trends, but I know lip oils have been everywhere (even though I am not sure exactly what they're for haha)! I wanted to give one a try as an alternative to lip balm or gloss. Maybe this product isn't the best out there, but it kind of sucks. The wash of colour is very, very sheer and doesn't really look orange. It feels nice on the lips and applies well, but wears off within seconds and my lips don't feel any more moisturized after using it consistently. I swear by Clinique's moisture surge lip treatment and I will be sticking with that, I likely would not repurchase this item.",thismodernidea,10 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Absolutely love this. Basically the only lip product that doesn't make my eczema flare! thank you for having a sensitive skin friendly products what a blessing!!,madelinek96,10 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"Love this lip oil! It keeps my lips nice and hydrated with a very subtle stain. I usually get very dry lips, especially in the dry winter months. This lip oil has kept my lips nicely supple!",Kokoalala,9 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Good for lips,"I love Gaga, so I had to get this and see all the hype. The color is so so pretty and love the way it feels on my lips.",kylee1410,8 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,super pretty and the colour lasts long. the only complaint i have is that it smells and tastes horrible and very chemically. and that it is a very small size for how much it costs.,qmdos,7 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Very pretty,"I first tried it in the shade Tint and even though it more like a gloss than a lip oil, I loved the shine and color so I got the shade Primary and it had a lot more pigment on my lips than the other one and I loved the stain it just looked like I had healthy pinker lips after removing it.",CrissyLove020,7 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not A Lip Oil,"So I ordered this lip oil believing it was actually a lip oil; its not. The product applies like a really heavy, thick, sticky lip gloss. The big doe foot applicator also doesn't pick up much product, which in this case could be a good thing. After sitting on my lips for a few minutes, the consistency did change to more of an oil feel, but still felt heavy and not very moisturizing like a true lip oil would be. 

TLDR/Final Thoughts: Not a true lip oil, more of a hybrid mix of sticky gloss with an oil finish. If wanting to try something different, I'd give it a shot. If you want a true lip oil, I'd sadly pass on this one.",BubblesHxC13,6 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Eh,Honestly wasn‚Äôt my favorite. It has a slightly chemically smell to it and the applicator is smaller than I expected.,zaxlq,6 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Cute,Love this lip oil. Feels super nice on the lips. I believe it‚Äôs worth the priceüíï,EmerryLY,6 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
HAUS LABS > DIOR,"I was looking for a lip oil because they tend to be less sticky and have a natural tint. I almost bought the Dior one, but really just couldn‚Äôt constitute spending $40 on a lip oil, so I bought the Haus Labs one. I got the color Primary and it is so beautiful and hydrating! So glad I purchased this one instead of Dior!",NMarieHudson,5 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Nothing to Rave About,"It‚Äôs not sticky so that‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs much thicker than a typical lip oil though. The big doe foot surprisingly doesn‚Äôt really deposit a whole lot of product onto your lips. Overall, I‚Äôll probably return this cause it‚Äôs really not worth the price.",Jessicamoon2130,4 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Daily lip product!,"I think as far as lip oils, this is one that I‚Äôll keep reaching for. The formula is not necessarily hydrating but oils aren‚Äôt supposed to be! I love the color as it just enhances my lips. It‚Äôs comfortable and not sticky.",kitty2526,3 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Go to summer gloss,My new go to lip gloss! Not sticky and lasts a long time.,sun264,2 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Nice Color, But Just Ok.","I love a good nourishing lip oil, but this missed the mark. The color is beautiful and not overly pigmented. However, I felt like I had to continuously apply this every 10 minutes. My lips would feel tacky yet dry, but like there was no product on them. Plus, it would leave my lips super chapped and peeling even after continuous use. Great for an on-the-go quick use, but I wouldn't recommend as any lip healing/treatment.",Emmaxsnow,2 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
pretty but drying,"I absolutely love the way that this product looks on my lips. It is absolutely gorgeous, but every time I have worn this product it has dried my lips out. If you wear this product I suggest putting Aquaphor or vaseline under it. Overall, there are better products out there that won't dry your lips.",Cassanelson,1 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
10/10,"I love this lip oil! It isn‚Äôt sticky, and leaves my lips SO hydrated!!",NYLETAK,1 Mar 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I love the formula but personally I dont like too much of a stain, be careful of how much you apply the color is very bright. Overall I love it!",audensta,28 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
New favorite lippy,I usually dont write reviews but I love this stuff! I think its better than dior lip oil even. It‚Äôs thinner and the color lasts a longgg time. I also am just obsessed with the color sheer cherry in general. Definitely want to try the pink one next!,HaleyS21,27 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I love lip oils and this is a new favorite. It's thinner and more lightweight than many of the gel/gloss type oils but just as nourishing. It gives the appearance of smoother, slightly fuller lips without any burning, cooling or minty sensation; it's not sticky and best of all, it doesn't get gummy after wearing for a while.

I waited months for Hue, the berry shade, to be restocked and I'm glad I did because while sheer, it gives a just bitten tint to the lips that's very flattering on my vampire pale, cool toned skin.

Although some have mentioned a faint sweet scent/flavor, I don't notice much of anything so those with sensitive noses likely won't have an issue. 
**In terms of texture and consistency, it's thinner than the Dior, Iconic London and Fenty lip oils but not as thin as ColourPop's Lux lip oil; this is a happy medium.",cara80,26 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Luhtchis lips üëÑ,"I want to give it 4 stars ONLY because of the price but alas the formula is sooo good! They give that perfect amount of color for a gloss, I love wearing them w/ a smudged lip liner. Non-sticky, hydrating and leaves a light lip stain later on (especially with the shade HUE) I have Secondary, Primary & Hue. I would definitely recommend even tho the price is mean üòÇ",yessiiiiiiiiee,25 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Like not love :(,"I bought 2 of these lip oils because they were decently priced and the colors were so pretty. Also, Lady Gaga. After I finish the two, I probably won‚Äôt buy them again. I like the colors, the light weight feel, and the lip stain tint it leaves when it dries. I like the aesthetic as well. The thing is, I don‚Äôt feel like this product is hydrating. I feel like my lips get super dry and start peeling. I also don‚Äôt like that the oil doesn‚Äôt stay on long- I know it‚Äôs not lip gloss but I‚Äôve used other lip oils that stay on longer than a few minutes. Worth a try for the colors but not a staple product for myself. I really wanted to love this product but the formula isn‚Äôt my fave.",selen3bean,25 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Slightly above average.,"I‚Äôve worn this product pretty consistently for the past 2 months. I really want to say I love it, but it‚Äôs a okay product. The color is pretty and the product is comfortable, but I don‚Äôt find it very nourishing. If Haus Labs could just add a little more nourishing ingredients, then I‚Äôd add the two additional stars.",MariaLS81,25 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
lovely,i love this lip oil in sheer cherry. i love having this for days i'm having a low key day with minimal makeup. keeps my lips hydrated and gives a nice gloss to the lips,cinnamonstick,24 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
hard pass,"i really do not enjoy this lip oil. i really wanted to , but it is so lackluster. there is a bit of color payoff but barely any shine payoff. the product collects on the line between the lip and inside mouth over time 
which is which is not something i‚Äôve experienced with other lip oils.",Dmbrown27,19 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I wanted to enjoy this lip oil, but it reminds me of something I could get from Claire's or Ardenes when I was a kid. The price is ridiculous for the amount of product you get. It doesn't hydrate the lips. It almost makes them feel more dehydrated after the oil wears off.",Samanthadawn08,14 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Amazing but tiny,"Absolutely love the look and feel of this, but you get a very small amount of product for the price",ToriKennedy,14 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Plump but peely,"Pros: Makes your lips look juicy & plump, and the colors are perfect!
Cons: Makes your lips peel like crazy üëéüèº",Pairuss,5 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A must have in my routine! Love it!,"This lip oil is amazing! It‚Äôs my new favorite lip oil, and the color lasts awhile and looks good, not patchy like lip tints can be. I like more of a lip gloss, lip balm, or lip oil vs lip liners and lipsticks. This lip oil is such a great product, a must try!",rissa1313,5 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I like this product but there's nothing wow about it. The applicator is so small, which is weirf for a lip oil because most of the time applicators are big. This is not worth the price. My hopes were so high, and I was extremely disappointed.",SarahShahda,5 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
a must have (if you mind the taste),it's amazing! I get so many compliments when I wear it (way more than when I wear the dior one) HOWEVER it tastes like rotten meat. I had a bunch of my friends try it and they all agree. it tastes really really bad. the only way I manage to wear it is being super careful not to get it in my mouth and chewing gum.,roseeesc,4 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Dior lip oil perfect dupe,"I have bought both Dior lip oil and Haus Labs by Lady Gaga lip oil. I would say that this is the perfect dupe for it. This is thinner and less stickier than the Dior lip oil. The color is also more vibrant. Very hydrating, basically didn't need to reapply for the rest of the day.",Sahkey,4 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,hands down the best clear lip oil!! does not change colors and isn‚Äôt overly sticky,chaysed,4 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Dupe for Clarins Lip Oil (shade: Candy),"The formula isn‚Äôt as thick, but if you love and miss the colour of the old Clarins Lip Oil in Candy, this is the closest dupe I‚Äôve found.",ErinG123,3 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I love this lip oil and I would definitely recommend to any one that is looking for a new lip oil.,ariannahb,2 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I was obsessed with this because of tiktok. To be honest, it makes my lips look plump and juicy, but it wears out easily and not hydrating at all",efarag,1 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I prefer this over the Dior lip oil - when I initially bought a lip oil I expected it to be‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ oily. Lol. They‚Äôre not - it‚Äôs similar to a gloss but not nearly as sticky and it‚Äôs a bit more hydrating. 
Also like a gloss, this is not an all day lasting thing. You will definitely have to reapply but in my opinion it is worth it if you‚Äôre looking for a nice, hydrating sheen. I apply after a lip liner and even when the oil has dried down, gone away or whatever it does - it‚Äôs blended out the liner nicely in a hydrating way that it still looks good. 

For the afraid of the orange tint, it‚Äôs not orangey at all. It‚Äôs a very mild tint that is hardly noticeable. Truly comparable to clear.",courtnetaalor,1 Feb 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love it,"I don‚Äôt understand as to why some of these reviews are negative but again, it‚Äôs per choice. I finally was able to get my hands on this pink one/cherry, and I just love it, the shine, and it just gives you a nice light glow of pink. I will definitely be by and get ago.",cheeylsigns99,30 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
My new favorite,"I've been using this lip oil for about a week now iI love how luscious it feels on my lips I'm using the orange and it really brings out my pink in my lips,my lips feel hydrated fora  long time afterwards it's not sticky and the shine love it‚ù£Ô∏è",Cherie17,30 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs Okay,"I like it but I don‚Äôt love it. It is not sticky and provides a nice clean gloss look. I chose the clear. It requires constant reapplying in my opinion. Like, every hour at least. It‚Äôs also really tiny for the price. I probably wouldn‚Äôt purchase again at this price point.",snobintx,28 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

No,I have no idea if these reviews are genuine but I returned this it‚Äôs terrible not an oil at all very very drying like instantly and not very much pigment,afbh,26 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Sad,Usually don‚Äôt write reviews but this was $24 and I‚Äôm very disappointed so here I am. I was wanting a dupe for the Dior lip oil (which I‚Äôve never used) since I didn‚Äôt want to pay $40. Maybe I should‚Äôve just splurged on dior. This lip oil is moisturizing and leaves a pretty sheen to lips but has no lasting power whatsoever. Def not worth the money or the hype.,Whit97,25 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
LOVE,color is noticeable but not extreme and has no taste or smell and doesn‚Äôt feel sticky,emilyM44,24 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

i want every single shade,i‚Äôm not even joking this is the best lip oil i have ever used. it‚Äôs not sticky which is so nice since all lip oils are sticky. it gives the best tint and lasts so long on my lips!,leahshowalter,21 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs just ok,"I‚Äôd give this 3.5 stars because it doesn‚Äôt seem worth the price and it‚Äôs not really lip oil but it stays on longer than most glosses. Its mildly hydrating.  It‚Äôs also very small. When I got it, I thought it was a sample. You can see it next to a sample size of Anastasia Crystal Gloss and it‚Äôs actually smaller. I do like how it does not come off when eating and drinking, and the tiny is really pretty.",isabee,19 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Amazing product tbh,Honestly this has become my favorite product and I use it every single day at the point that I have it with me on my purse.,Ninivazquez9710,17 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,I bought this product because I saw an influencer on TikTok review it and say they loved it. So when I tried it on today I was a little disappointed. It's not a bad product because my lips did feel nice for like 30 min and the color was pretty. I don't think it's worth the cost of it though. I won't buy it again.,Tulsi08,10 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Good, but bad taste.","I really like this product and it lasts super long and plumps my lips, but it leaves a really awful taste in my mouth.",Kady27,9 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Cute but not 24$ cute,"Honestly I wasn't a big fan of this at first, I felt as it was too thick and that's coming from a person who does two layers of lipgloss, but I came around to love it, the formula is clean and you can tell thanks to the fact that it has that cosmetic smell, I love using it throughout the day because it is his shine and truly hydrating, I also always get asked what I'm wearing and I'm always so happy to say ""Thanks, it's HAUS!"" just remember to apply ti and really smear it out on your lips, otherwise it will feel too thick. I would recommend this too a gaga fan, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to everyone.",DanilDiachenko,9 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Does the job!,Absolutely love this lip oil! Randomly found it while looking for the Laneige Lip Balm. I was a bit worried about the tint as orange isnt a flattering color on me‚Ä¶ but its actually almost neutral!,Tanvi0310,8 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Absolutely love it!!,"After I got it, I immediately tried it on and loved it! It‚Äôs not sticky at all to me and it tinted my lips a beautiful pink color. My lips are very chapped and this lip oil makes them feel so hydrated!",annalis230,7 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A bit of a miss,"Honestly not super impressed by the product. The color is a bit blunt on lighter skin tones and was very sticky in my opinion. I do love my Dior Lip Oil and although they are the same size, I'd rather spend a bit more on Dior.",rachaeldavid1,3 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
It's ok.,The color is pretty. I'll give it that. I just find it rather sticky. I also don't love the taste. I'm going to stick with Cherry Treat and Innbeauty lip oil but if you're after color instead of moisture then this might be the one for you.,kellye8498,3 Jan 2023,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Amazing product, okay packaging","I love this lip oil. It's not sticky at all, leaves my lips feeling super hydrated, and makes them look incredibly juciy.

A must!!!,"I have not tried many lip oil products before but I must say this one wins my heart. My lips were dry with some lip balm (sticks) so I had to try oil. When I purchased this one, the lovely lady at checkout also told me that she owns one too. Really happy with the purchase.",NickyCao,27 Dec 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Weird fibres,this product is so pretty and would be really smooth if it didn't have little chunks of something in it. it's almost as if it wasn't filtered or the colouring wasn't mixed properly. it's so uncomfortable and every time i apply it i have to pick the little pieces out. fibres of the applicator also come off on your lips incessantly.,cedarj2543,23 Dec 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Good but could be better,"Love the hint of color in this shade (Sheer Cherry) and I love the feel of this product. My only complaint is that it doesn't last / wear very long. I know most lip ""oils"" don't but compared to my favorite by Hourglass, the wear time was pretty disappointing.",staceyjo63,23 Dec 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Too bright for me,"I recently purchased this lip oil in the shade primary, and would overall say I was disappointed with this product, even though I really want to love it. The texture of the lip oil is fine, but I was not expecting this shade to leave my lips a neon hot pink color. This product is VERY pigmented and hardly sheer at all. I also have to dip my applicator back in the container a few times to get a substantial amount of product. I would suggest the Patrick Ta lip oil instead, or recommend saving up for the Dior lip oil. I also think any Fenty gloss would be more nourishing than this. I am considering returning this product.",audreyybarrera,22 Dec 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Great applicator + non sticky formula but the orange shade marketed turns hot pink on me because of the PH adjusting ingredient. It should be mentioned that can happen bc I wanted a clear gloss not hot pink,aybobay,22 Dec 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Not worth the hype,"I was really excited for this lip oil. I was highly disappointed. The texture is fine. No smell or taste, I like that. However it made my lips extremely dry. Not nourished at all.

weird aftertaste,"I love Lady Gaga and I really wanted to like this. The texture is a little sticky, and the color is much darker than I expected (based on my experience with the Dior Lip Glow Oil). But the worst part for me is the aftertaste! I can't stand it. I have tried several other lip oils and lip treatments, and I don't usually have an issue with the taste, except with Vaseline, Aquaphor and Coola, but I only use those at night, or if I go running when it's sunny. I can put up with the taste if there is a specific benefit to the product, or if I wear it to sleep, but this Lip Oil is meant to be worn during the day for cosmetic reasons, so it's not worth it for me.",gbplots,14 Nov 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Better than Dior!,I just bought this item and it is better than the Dior lip oil! it is not as thick and feels like you have nothing on! the color is also really pretty. I love it!,ghardy,30 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not sticky just perfect,I was sceptical about a lip oil not being sticky or gummy but this is great product the give a nice sheer coverage with a very silky finish.,TatieB,30 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Reformulated, redesigned & renamed, but better?","I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.

TL;DR: 
* Most of the revisions that Lady Gaga and her team put into reformulating, redesigning and renaming their products are subtle, but are they better? Having tried both the old and new versions in a couple of shades, I say yes, the overall results of this rebrand is a better product, especially as far as these hybrid lip oils go, and this Hue shade in particular. 
* The color payoff of this newer, rebranded version is much more intense, pigmented than the older version, both at the application stage and as the product dries down to leave a stain on the lips.

SIMILARITIES: 
* Color - the shade Hue is a pretty berry shade that seems to have the most saturated color of all the shades in this lip oil series
* Thin consistency - both version have a thinner consistency than most lip oils, making both less sticky and tacky
* Applicator shape - larger doe foot applicator
* Hybrid skincare - makeup formula
* Leaves a beautiful stain on the lips (but also see below)
* Vegan
* Cruelty free

DIFFERENCES: 
* Ingredients - clean formula in new version
* Design - old version has a light, plastic black top/cap; new version has a silver coated plastic cap that while also lightweight has more heft to it
* Labeling - in addition to its name change, the font style & size are different - new version looks more crisp and clean
* Formulation - formula of the original seems to separate easily making it look as if the product is a bi-phase one (though maybe this is because of age?) 
* Weight - the new packaging has more weight to it but it‚Äôs not heavy by any means. When compared to the new version, the packaging for the original seems a little on the cheap side.  
* Pigmentation - while both shades wear beautifully on my naturally pigmented lips, the newer version seems more richly saturated in color than the old version.

BUY, BUY, BUY or BYE-BYE?
* This is an easy BUY-BUY-BUY for me.",itsfi,30 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Amazing formula, don't love the color","I want to start off by saying that this rating is based off of the COLOR ONLY. These lip oils feel absolutely amazing on your lips. But the shade Primary was just way too bright when activated by my pH. It kind of looked like a red Popsicle stained my lips. The other colors are beautiful, and they do get brighter the more you reapply, except the clear shade which doesn't provide tint, but provides the same amazing hydration.",Gee07,28 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Non-sticky juicy hydration,"Does what it claims‚Äî adds a moisturizing pop of color. I have been wearing this oil nonstop the past 2 days, and my lips feel incredible. The stain is nice, and my lips feel moisturized even when I blot the product. Consistency-wise, it does feel like a thin-medium thickness gloss, but not nearly as sticky as any other gloss I‚Äôve tried. Be aware‚Äî the pH adjustment feature means that the product will turn into a brighter pink color when you eat or drink acidic things, like coffee. Also, due to how thin it is, it may bleed a little if one has lots of fine lines around their lips. It isn‚Äôt overly long-wearing, but it doesn‚Äôt claim to be. After it dries/ rubs off with drinking/talking/etc, it will sometimes leave a nice stain, but can easily be wiped away, if needed. I don‚Äôt mind re-applying every 2 hours or so. On my pale-ish skin, this product does look pretty dang pink, as opposed to a natural blush. I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone who is looking for something moisturizing and unscented, that provides a nice wash of color.",itsconvention,28 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
No boyfriend needed,I got all the colors shade. Obviously obsessed. I think I should make a review on this on my small YouTube channel: Wendy Wetbottoms,WendyWetbottoms,27 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"THIS lip oil is perhaps the best one I have used yet. I love the Kosas lip oil and the Innbeatuy project ones, too, but THIS one has surprised me. Its juicy, cushiony, nourishing, and has the perfect sheer wash of color. The glow that comes from this reminds me of the original dior lip glow. Yeah i will be repurchasing.",Kyleyak,25 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
perfect!!!!!!,this lip oil stays on like a gloss and gives a glossy finish but isn‚Äôt sticky at all and gives an awesome natural tint and this company has very inclusive color ranges to fit all skin shades,puppylover102,22 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A MUST HAVE,Oh my god‚Ä¶ this lip oil is THE best lip product I have ever tried. It healed my EXTREMELY dry lips only after a few uses and is my favorite to date. I tried so many other lip products before and this had been the best by far‚Ä¶ I love it sooo much.has beeen the best by fa,Ish4129,20 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
My daily lip oil,I love this product not sticky at all and has a slight color. Great for a daily lip oil,Ambarcelona,20 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Great product,It is genuinely hydrating and the colour does through a moment after application.  Stays on for several hours. The colour is lovely but less intense than it looks in the tube.,jjsgirl,19 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Perfect light color for everyday use & feels great,"This lip oil is great. It‚Äôs not greasy feeling, sets decently quick, and leaves the perfect amount of color. The color is sheer and just the perfect tint. I do wish it lasted longer but lasts at least an hour or 2 without heavy activity.",Beaut13,19 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

this is a must in my everyday routine!,literally the best product ever but a little bit on the pricey side but would recommend!,Addisssson,12 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Very disappointed lip oil guru,This feels cheap. The color looks hot pink on my lips and it dries down within minutes. It‚Äôs not as good as other lip oils on the market that are cheaper.,heymrscarter,11 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend!!!!,"It‚Äôs pretty on lips but doesn‚Äôt last long , I have to reapply too often and it leaves white residue on lips ! I hate it :( also not hydrating at all",lyndsey1233,10 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Easy go to,"LOVE!! Glides on so easily, not sticky at all. Nice color for when my lips are too dry for a matte color. Feels good too.",katyss,8 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"So amazing, I am very happy with this lip oil.","Probably the best product you could ever own for your lips. I‚Äôve never used a lip oil this buttery and smooth ever. It keeps my lips hydrated for hours with just one application. I leaned towards it over others because it has no scent and it‚Äôs just an overall amazing product to keep your lips extremely hydrated. Plus it just looks amazing on the lips, better than any gloss I own too.",ArmandoJohns,7 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love this Lip Oil,I've used a bunch of different lip oils.  Some claiming to be hydrating and long lasting - but all have failed.  This is THE BEST lip oil I have used to date.  It is very hydrating and lasts a decent amount of time.  The coverage is gorgeous - exactly what I want in a lip oil.  Added plus is that it doesn't dry out my lips when it wears out like other lip oils do.  I hope they come out with more colors soon!,nyorker99,6 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not Hydrating,Amount of product you get and the fact that it doesn't hydrate your lips is baffling. this seems like a travel size and it cost almost 30 dollars. I don't think this is worth it. Lunar beauty and KAB have legitimate lip oils that will hydrate ALL day this won't even last an hour.,IceyTheGreat,5 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love,I‚Äôm not a big lip oil person I actually bought this on accident lol but I ended up falling in love with it! I was going to return it but tried it on first and changed my mind! I was trying to buy the Atomic Shale is what happened,JaricaLW,4 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
No regrets,"Feels luxurious! Not sticky, great touch of colour, and a nice but of shine. Wears down nicely for a perfect subtle shine and tint of colour. Will definitely be trying more of these!",migou,4 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Amazing,"I just received this yesterday. I immediately opened it and put it on my lips. I was not expecting to love it so much. I was worried about the color, but it looked really natural and pretty. The feeling that this oil leaves on your lips is wonderful. It's not sticky or gooey - it just feels really moisturizing and nice. I'm likely going buy more colors in the future.",MetalJess,4 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,My new fav gloss. I got the orange shade and it's the perfect peachy coral for my lips. Plus it's sooo comfy to wear and the bottle is so pretty to pull out. I might check out the other colors too...,arielskylar,3 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Loving This Lip Oil!,I found that this product really helped hydrate my lips and it did wonders for me! I love the color and I have found that with every Haus Laboratories product I have used has been very successful for me. Can't wait to buy more products from them!,kayleecat86,2 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A FALL MUST-HAVE!!!,"This lip oil is one of the best I've tried! It is the most beautiful shade of sheer purple/berry that is perfect for Fall. Not sticky, lightweight, and is long-lasting. I pair it with the Haus Labs Le Monster Lip Crayon in Mauve Matte when going out, but it is beautiful and pigmented enough to wear alone on an everyday basis.",aves1424,1 Oct 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A must-have everywhere I go.,"I am obsessed. Honestly one of the best lip products I could have. It is really hydrating and when it dries after a while, it leaves a nice natural lip colour. I would change the presentation tho, it‚Äôs too basic for me but other than that this is perfect and I‚Äôm loving it.",ELIZABETHMOK,30 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
i don‚Äôt get the point of it?,I decided to try this out because i‚Äôm running a bit low on my Dior Lip Oil but was kind of confused because it doesn‚Äôt last and i don‚Äôt feel that it actually moisturizes the lips. Color is nice tho.,sosobaby23,29 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
the best lip oil on the market currently !!,I‚Äôm 100% obsessed- this beats out every other lip oil on the market in my opinion. It has tons of skin-loving ingredients like squalane for nourishment + there‚Äôs no scent which means no irritation! It‚Äôs fashionable skincare for your lips. All of the colors are gorgeous as well- the natural tints they leave behind just make it even better than it already is. I especially like to go to sleep with it on and wake up with freshly moisturized and tinted lips! I‚Äôm wearing the shade Hue in the picture attached :),KatEvangelou,29 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"It applied very well, but I took it off quickly due to whatever scent nonscent it had.",bellathings,28 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,This is amazing!! It‚Äôs been a couple hours and I still feel the moisture on my lips. It gives the perfect non-sticky shine over a liner/lipstick.,Nicferreira,28 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"This oil is beautiful but couldn't get over the weird ""aftertase"" I returned",lyly91,28 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love!,"Love love love!! My lips do NOT get tacky after applied, love the feel of it, like it‚Äôs actually making my lips soft! Which they are, subtle tint! Only negative thing, it does not last long. If that‚Äôs what your looking for this isn‚Äôt for  you.",Sloan1226,28 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Disappointed,"Feels very nice on the lips (great applicator!), but doesn‚Äôt hydrate. The effect is minimal and not long lasting. I really wanted to love this, but it made my lips feel drier overnight.",ZachH3,27 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
You need this lip oil in your life!,I‚Äôve tried so many glosses and oils. Most are sticky or slide off.  This lip oil is nourishing and stays on well.  I‚Äôm 100% sold on Haus Labs by Lady Gaga products.  Haven‚Äôt bought anything I don‚Äôt love.,AKChica,27 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I wanted to love this so bad I don't hate it I don't even dislike it. it's a really nice gloss. I think I was expecting just a little more from it It leaves a really soft light pink shade on my lips it's not a stain. I guess my only complaint is I wish it lasted longer it wears off very quickly I also wish I would have gone with a deeper shade just to have a little bit more color. other then that I like it. a bit over priced in my opinion your paying more for the name on it. but I love Gaga and that's why I went this Secondary that's her go to. it looks orange in the bottle when applying it's pink.,Froggypuss,26 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I don‚Äôt wear make up but I will use this everyday,"I finally got this product after reading and watching numerous reviews‚Ä¶SO HAPPY with my purchase! I love the shape of the applicator and how smooth the product glides on. Upon application, this lip oil feels and shines like a lip gloss, but it wears like an ultra hydrating lip balm. Not sticky, but so moisturizing. 

My lips are closer in shade to my skin tone, so I‚Äôm often lacking a lot of rose in my complexion. The tint in this lip oil is light but just the PERFECT amount to bring the colour in my face out, giving me that fresh faced look. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, I highly recommend it! Beautiful product and I will definitely be repurchasing again!",froggreen0828,26 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
It‚Äôs whatever!,"I liked it the first night I got it, woke up to tony pimples around my lips üò≠",antibritt,26 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Beautiful natural look,"Beautiful subtle color payoff. Natural look, ultra moisturizing! I wasn‚Äôt sure about the Orange but took a chance, to me it gives off more pink tones.",lerinfaith,26 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Performs so well,I love the feel so much and it looks great on its own as well as over other lip products. There‚Äôs a slight taste that you can kind of taste/smell for a small bit after application but it wears off and someone less sensitive to smell than me probably wouldn‚Äôt notice it all i am a highly sensitive person.,binksays,25 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Such an amazing lip oil,I love this product so much. My lips feel amazing and they look so nice and juicy when I wear this product,MillieLasic,25 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Performs like a high quality gloss,"Just tried this in sheer pink and here are my key takeaways:
- appears fairly clear on first application but really delivers color to my lips after a minute or two
- sheer pink is almost a ‚Äòmy lips but better color‚Äô which is exactly what I wanted 
- acts as a high quality, hydrating, non-sticky gloss
- no scent 
- nice packaging and will last a long time
- I had to reapply for extra shine after eating but the color stayed on
- if you are undecided between berry and sheer pink, sheer pink is not too pink nor too bright. Berry may have been too dark for me but would be a nice fall color!",Chamalyeon,23 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I love it! the tint shade leaves a stain. Its kind of similar to the old Clarin‚Äôs lip oil but thinner, which I loved. Really shiny too! Oh it doesn‚Äôt have a scent or taste.",soufvb,22 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
NOPE,THE INGREDIENTS ARE TOXIC. She should know better.     NOPE!!!,Shqipesin,21 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

The colors are only pretty in the bottle,"Super hyped for this lady Gaga lip stain oil.

,Love the sheer color it gives off and gives good hydration!,rebeccasxoxo1,19 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Amazing for those with sensitive and peeling lips,"The squalane is so hydrating. It goes on smoothly, the color is even but subtle. It doesn‚Äôt absorb immediately and it leaves a bit of color behind. I do need to apply it often, but as conditioning as it is (for someone with constantly chapped and peeling lips), that‚Äôs a plus. It‚Äôs so hydrating and my lips have never felt better.",Austinelizabeth,19 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
So disappointed,Terrible. Loved the shade and that‚Äôs where it ends. It dried my lips out and colour doesn‚Äôt last at all. It also doesn‚Äôt apply evenly. Put me off buying any other products from this line.,Jellwood,19 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Yas product!,Love it! it has helped to keep my dry lips feeling hydrated,louikraynak,16 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
WOW! I absolutely love this,I tried Hue & Tint and both were so pretty! I love the natural lip color it turns into. Also it starts glossy. This stuff is really good. Very moisturizing too.

üòî,"Meh. I expected to like it but I didn‚Äôt. The color is beautiful but it doesn‚Äôt last at all. It‚Äôs a thinner lip oil, which I love but if you‚Äôre looking for the color to last a lil longer I recommend tower 28‚Äôs lip oil jelly glosses.",megaforest24,15 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

DRIED MY LIPS OUT!  Beautiful colour though!,"I REALLY wanted to love this lip oil. The colour is so beautiful and the shine is amazing.. however, it comes off very easily and it dried out my lips very badly.  My lips have been peeling non stop now after only 2 days of use.

Maybe a good gloss but a bad oil‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve tried a lot of lip oils and this one is among the worst. I‚Äôm so disappointed in the brand and especially the price point. It does not feel hydrating at all - in part because of the texture of the applicator. When I use a lip OIL I want hydration and nourishment‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt get anything like that from this product.,tjforty,13 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Perfect!!!!!,"This wears beautifully for hours without needing to reapply. It fades slowly and evenly, and it leaves behind a comfortable stain of color. Topping the leftover stain with Fenty Skin lip oil worked well, too.",crazy4cosmetics2,12 Sep 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,"love this product! doesn‚Äôt look look orange, looks very natural. not sticky at all. would purchase again:)",georgiaem,27 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"Ok, I still prefer Buxom lip gloss, to this mainly because it is both amazing but also very long lasting as a gloss but that has become so expensive and you only get 4 MLS of product where as you get 7 MLS with Haus Labs for only a couple dollars more.  Fenty has 9 MLS but does not last quite as long as Buxom and is also pricy.  The main factor that I think will allow me to repurchase the Haus Labs though would be the Tint it leaves behind.  Even if it does wear off it‚Äôs not like you ate all your money because it leaves a very pretty colour, at least in the shade I purchased ‚ÄúHue‚Äù.  Also, this has been the main staple in my purse for weeks and it barely looks even an 1/8th empty so over all I do think it‚Äôs a good value.  I think I will try Secondary next time, apparently it‚Äôs Gaga‚Äôs go too and I have similar colouring to her.  Plus I do love Gaga.",slooop,27 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
get this! cruelty free alternative to dior!,"Really cute tint, not super dark but that‚Äôs to be expected w lip oil. No fragrance, feels smooth on the lips. Not too thick either. I‚Äôve been looking for a cruelty free lip oil and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! Only thing is I would have loved a scent & for the formula to be a bit wetter.",Dyanamac,26 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
perfect lip oil,"love it! some of the lip oils I‚Äôve tried in the past have been a bit tacky or greasy, but this one glides on with ease and leaves my lips feeling glossy and moisturized. the applicator is perfect and provides great coverage in just a few swipes.",danast,25 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Amazing lip oil, horrible taste/smell","This is one of the best lip oils I've tried. I LOVE the color and the way it changes color to match your lips, and then leaves a pretty tint afterwards. However, the taste/smell of this product is almost unbearable. I'm usually not sensitive to smells or fragrance in my products, but the taste/smell is super chemically and another reviewer mentioned 'melted butter' and I can't get that out of my head either. I will continue using this lip oil because the color is just so pretty but I won't be purchasing until they do something about the horrible fragrance.",ccwong,25 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,These are IDENTICAL to the Dior lip oils! Wow   I‚Äôm impressed,dena78,24 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
New fave lip product,"I looove ittt! It‚Äôs so nice and moisturizing on the lips, it almost has an essence of stickiness, like you think it‚Äôs there, but it‚Äôs not really sticky. Leaves my lips feeling nourished and the wash of color is definitely visible.",Gaybong,24 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"On darker skin tones, there is no difference between shades of lip oil. It looks like a regular high quality gloss . It says there is lip plumping action , no tingling or discomfort caused by the product . Average quality, not worth this high price point . Charlotte Tilbury & Fenty have better options",drfoodiemtl,24 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Moisturizing; not sticky!,So moisturizing without feeling sticky. Really subtle color so I love layering it with the Melon Matte lip crayon. I much prefer this to the Atomic Shake Lipstick which smells terrible and has a tacky texture. I'll definitely be getting more of these in different shades!,ntayy,23 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I really wanted to love this and I thought I couldn‚Äôt go wrong with picking the clear but I was wrong. It leaves a horrible smell/taste on your lips. I can‚Äôt decide if it‚Äôs a chemical or soapy smell/taste. It was too late to return it so I threw it in the trash.,Tilty,21 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"Purchased the Sheer Berry.  Although the product appeared to be pigmented, it basically applied clear on the lips, even after vigorously shaking it.  I returned this.  I was expecting gloss, but that it would leave some stain of color on my lips, but it didn't.",kayflorida,20 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
obsessed,"Love love love this product! It does have a little bit of a thicker consistency but is certainly not sticky nor feel to heavy on the lips. It genuinely feels like a nice, super hydrating lip balm/treatment. I can‚Äôt recommend this enough! The stain that this leaves behind is beautiful as well. Love that it‚Äôs multipurpose, too - if you don‚Äôt want glossy lips, you can wipe the product off after a few minutes and continue to have the tint.",laurspresso,18 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Womp.,I was so looking forward to finally getting my hands on this lip oil. I was so SO disappointed. I felt the colour was significantly lighter than in pictures - basically clear.

,"hydrating but not sticky, and the shade is just gorgeous!",mmelinda,15 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Thin and hydrating formula,"I've purchased a lip oil from Lady Gaga's original Haus Labs collection and was interested in trying the new line at Sephora. I took the opportunity to purchase this Secondary shade (described as a sheer orange color) with a gift card in exchange for my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador. Like the original, this oil applied smoothly and wore comfortably, and has a thinner consistency than other lip oils on the market. The thinner formulation makes the oil less goopy, gooey, and sticky than other lip oils, but that does not diminish its hydrating properties at all. This lip oil felt nicely hydrating on my lips the entire time I had it on. It stayed on for most of the morning, even through multiple sips of water and coffee. I did notice a very slight tingling on my lips  (upper right side only) - it only lasted for a few minutes and was very faint; it was also a tingling sensation and not a stinging one. The packaging on this relaunched version includes a wide doe foot applicator (same as in the original version) but unlike the original, the cap on this is different and can be used as a mirror for applying other lip products - since it's part of the handle with the applicator you can't look into it while applying the oil. 

This lip oil is unscented, applied smoothly, and wore comfortably. Though thinner in consistency than other lip oils, it still provided some good hydration. I noticed the slightest tingling (not stinging) on the upper right side of my lip for a few seconds, but that was it. One thing I'd like to note is that this Secondary shade goes on pink (and not orange) on me, but my lips are more pigmented to begin with, so your mileage will vary. Overall, I like this lip oil and am interested in picking up another shade at some point, probably the sheer berry tint (Shade: Hue).",itsfi,15 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"This really is an everyday colour to wear. 

I guess it depends on the natural lip colour, but definitely does not come as orange as depicted on its own. The shine is great, but if you blot it off, the stain really works as well.",Blanchi,15 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,way better then any lip oil i‚Äôve ever tried . will be purchasing this another 100 times. the secondary color left such a beautiful colour on my lips. isn‚Äôt sticky at all either!,sydneyannee,12 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
melted butter anyone?,"Let me start this off by saying I am not at all sensitive to tastes or smells. However, I just received this in the mail and I want to vomit from the taste of this lip oil. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect because it‚Äôs my first lip oil, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they aren‚Äôt supposed to taste like melted butter slathered on your lips. I immediately had to take this off because of the taste alone and will be returning it. Really disappointed in the incentivized reviews lately taking over Sephora‚Äôs site.",Ahlecks,11 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I love it! Its an amazing color, and fantastic consistency. I think this is better than Dior Lip Oil. would buy other colors too. <3",aparnadargar,8 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not sticky but no plumping for me,"Nice amount of shine with none of the sticky lip gloss feel! I really like this, but I don‚Äôt notice any plumping. It states that as a benefit, and that is what I was hoping to see.  It is a really lovely lip oil that leaves a hint of color. I like it by itself and have enjoyed layering it over various lipsticks to subtly change the shade. Works great over some matte stains I have that can leave my lips a little dry feeling.",MeaRe85,8 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"this is one of my all time favorite lip oils. it's not too expensive and it really is so beautiful and exactly what a lip oil should be. it's so nourishing, not sticky AT ALL. the color is so pretty on my lips and i find the it leaves a settle and gorgeous stain behind as well. overall, i'm in love!",kailynicolee,5 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
IN LOVE! Favorite lip oil!,"I bought this on a whim and didn‚Äôt know what to expect‚Ä¶ first time trying Haus Labs and this did not disappoint! I was AMAZED by this lip oil! Super moisturizing, NOT STICKY at all, and long lasting. It gives my lips the perfect tint of pink‚Ä¶ it gives me the perfect natural pout that I love! Even after the shine wears off the pink tint stays on my lips all day which I love because it‚Äôs like a lip tint! I love that it‚Äôs unscented and not as expensive as other lip oils. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!",hellyyy,5 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"This lip oil is one of the couple things I picked up from the Haus labs relaunch, I have never tried a lip oil but was interested in this one because of the tint to it. The orange looked gorgeous on the model and I needed it. This is a very comfortable lip oil, it isn‚Äôt heavy or sticky and you don‚Äôt have to put on a lot of layers for it to be shiny. I definitely will be repurchasing this shade along with another.",TaylorMarriie,5 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

I love them!,"I love them! Not sticky, feels moisturizing for quite a while. Makes a natural color to my lips. I have the orange and tgis one. Will buy again.",mverbosh,4 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I returned, purchased 3 shades. They all looked clear. I just did not like the smell or taste of this lip oil. Tasted like soap. It didn‚Äôt feel to bad on the lips and the packaging is very cute.",nadajw,3 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I choose the sheer orange and because of the ph setting after a few time my lips were vibrant pink. The formula is nice and isn‚Äôt sticky. After a while the ¬´¬† ph¬†¬ª started cristalizing in the bottle. The two stars is for the formula.,biskhender,3 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Light and not at all sticky. Just the right amount of color and shine. Would like if it lasted a little longer but if I wanted that I‚Äôd switch to a lipstick. Bought this color first and then went back and bought the sheer pink as well.,TzippiFeigy,1 Aug 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Very hydrating!,"Excellent lip oil! I use a sugar scrub first thing in the morning and follow up with this lip oil. I find applying it once in the morning is enough to keep my lips hydrated all day. If you're looking for that shine, you would definitely need to reapply, but if you're looking for moisture, I find applying once enough.",TJ92,31 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"Best lip oil I‚Äôve used thus far. It isn‚Äôt super pigmented; just enough to brighten my lip color. Looks similar to a gloss after application. 

I like the applicator, and the tube was filled almost completely upon removal of the applicator. Feels moisturizing and realistically the only issue I feel people might have with it is it doesn‚Äôt last super long and I find myself reapplying it every hour or so, but I don‚Äôt mind (especially as far as oils go.)

Price is reasonable too.",HitchCanan,30 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,There product was amazing.  Went on smooth and shiny. I liked the product.,Bloddyhell46,29 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Meh,Hardly any color despite how it looks in the tube. Returned.,TheVaBeachGirl,29 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Big fan,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this one. The tint seems subtle at first but it slowly develops on your lips into a strong pink. It feels so luxurious and velvety on the lips, wasn't sticky, and seems to last a while on the lips. When it does fade, my lips still feel moisturized, unlike other lip oils that leave me feeling dry and sticky. The pink doesn't quite flatter me, so I'm going to try the orange color, but overall 10/10.",stinkybishop,28 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Very drying even for an oil!,Drying. I've used Dior for years. this can not compare when it comes to moisturizing your lips. Wears off quickly. Tint is lacking. Vaseline would be better than this. I can't recommend.,moonsta,26 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
smells,this lip oil smells and taste disgusting I don't get it. all of these reviews are incentivized which is ridiculous there should be real reviews not people who got this for free. this brand is a joke.,SimplyCheryl,26 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
LIP OIL LIKE NO OTHER!,"Omg! This lip oil is the best thing I ever tried! I have any lip oils some leave my lips dry & patchy, others just feel like their sitting on top no pigment & not absorbing. But THIS it feels beautiful on the lips gives you a beautiful tint on the lips. It absorbs in your lips so your lips feel so smooth & soft right after.",MakeItUpSteph,26 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"OMG, this lip oil is amazing. Nice dark pink color and even leaves a light stain on your lip after the shine goes away. Vegan ingredients so your lips stay moisturized and doesn‚Äôt leave that weird white line :). You do have to reapply but who cares! Already bought another shade.",glossykit,23 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Surprised!!,I thought this would be thick but it‚Äôs a nice consistency. Non sticky and very hydrating. The color is super sheer and I do wish it was more pigmented. Also there was some clumped pigment inside the tube maybe that has something to do with it?! Overall I would buy again!,Andre19,23 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Worth It!,So great! Was moisturizing long after it wore off and gave just enough tint to layer with a lipstick!,Leah2208,23 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
it‚Äôs de,"Say! This is a pretty decent product. It‚Äôs my first time trying a lip oil so I have nothing to compare it to. Beautiful shine, hint of colour, and not sticky at all.  I love the way the colour looks peachy pink on my lips. I docked a star as 31 dollars for a lip product is a bit of a splurge for me, but I think it should last quite awhile.",Serenabobeana,23 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
KISS OR MISS,"For starters I'm not a fan of purchasing celebrity make up brands. HOWEVER I had to make an exception for mi Lady Gaga. I'm a lip product junkie.

Packaging: I respect the fact that the bottle is full. I expected it to be half full once I pulled the wand out, that is how it usually goes with lip glosses. 

Applicator: The applicator is a foot shaped wand. It is a nice universal applicator since everyone's lips are different. 

Product quality v.s. expectations:

This is advertised as a ""hybrid lip oil"". I can only speak on the neutral (clear color). I purchased the clear since I wear masks. 

The consistency of this reminds me of Buxom's plump shot collagen lip product. 

This has a glide to it. Compared to Bare Minerals lip glosses, Buxom, Rare beauty etc., I feel that this is less sticky. I also didn't experience any product build up or crust from this product. 

It gives a neutral shine, making the lips look healthier. 

I tend to have very dry skin and lips due to the medications I take, I do feel that this helped soften and hydrate my lips. 

However, it does not last long on your lips. I felt that I had to reapply throughout the day even when I didn't wear a mask. To be fair most lip oils do not last long on the lips, and since this is a hybrid lip oil, I expected it to last longer. 

I feel that the neutral color will work beautifully if you were to wear a neutral or brown toned lip liner. If you are more into the natural look this would be a good product. 

The reason I am rating this between a 
3.5-4 / 5 stars is because of the price point and quality of the product. I feel that there should be more product for $25 especially if you have to keep reapplying it. Also, it is a basic lip gloss. I wish it had more of a shine and plumping effect to it.",sunnysidesin,22 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I have dry skin, and even dryer lips. I have tied every lip balm out balm out there (yes, even the La Mer one), and while lip balms feel great, they're not that great. 

THIS. IS. GREAT. Nice feeling on the lips, very moisturizing, with a touch of peach color. You have to reapply every couple hours, but for the first week in a long while, my lips aren't chapped.",EvilCupcake,21 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I think this lip oil is super pretty on the lips and i love that the color changes according to your PH levels! I feels really nice and it‚Äôs not sticking. The only thing is that it doesn‚Äôt last super long on the lips because it is a thinner consistency.,tamaraokah,21 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
don‚Äôt recommend,I‚Äôm confused. This is an awful product. It‚Äôs drying and the color is extremely sheer. I don‚Äôt understand the appeal of this at all.,momlvsmkup,21 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

It makes me ecstatic knowing that this product is made clean, cruelty free, and vegan! It‚Äôs so shocking. I never would have thought about getting a lip oil until now and now I‚Äôm going to stick with this one for a loooooooong time!

,"I didn't find that it did anything for my lips. I also didn't think it had a tint to it. Definitely wasn't moisturizing and my hair would stick to it in the wind. So all together I like the shine, but the product could be better.",CluelessHids,20 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Lip Oil is Amazing!!!!,"I LOVE THIS LIP OIL! When I first saw it, i immediately flashed back to the lip ball rollers and prayed it didn't slick and stick like that...and it definitely didn't!

Vibrant Color,"Haus labs by lady gaga phd hybrid lip oil tint sheer pink. Vibrant and Beautiful colour, slippery and snot sticky. This made my lips feels really moisturized which is very hard for me.

Dont believe the hype - trust me,"I've never left a negative review for a makeup product but I felt like it was needed for this product /: Pros: vegan. Cons: it smells and feels like canola oil on your lips. Yes, I understand it's a lip OIL but there are farrrr better ones out there that don't make me want to vomit from smell & taste. I've never thrown out a product before due to scent but I probably will with this product. I'm sad because I was super excited to try this but it was just an all around miss for me.",bananagirl123,20 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Beautiful color!,"Disclaimer: I received this product for free as part of a campaign for Influenster and Haus Labs in exchange for my honest review.
I love this lip oil! I got this in the sheer berry shade and I love the shade! I have a light/medium skin tone with yellow undertones and it works very well with my skin tone! I‚Äôm very happy that it has a doe foot applicator which makes it very easy to apply product. It‚Äôs great alone or layered over other products. I love that the lip oil does not leave a super sticky residue unlike some other lip oils I‚Äôve tried in the past. It‚Äôs also very hydrating as well. The only reason I deducted a star was because I think the price point ($24) is a little too high and would probably stop me from repurchasing in the future.",arwendell,20 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

At first glance, I thought it would have an everlasting glossy/sticky look, which I don't like, but right after my first use, I realized that your skin absorbs the oil and you're left with plump moisturized beautiful lips with a pop of color. My favorite product from the box. Absolutely recommend. Love, love, love!",alinecmoral,19 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Gorgeous color, long lasting.",My favorite thing about this Lip Oil was that it's not sticky like a lip gloss. The color is so beautiful. Very easy to apply and long lasting.,ClaudiaTX,19 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
(Lip Crayon + Lip Oil) = Tinted Lips,"Great for individuals who have chapped lips. In comparison to other lip oil, this is moisturizing on the lips without being sticky. A little goes a long way. The shade that I have is Tint, which is a sheer pink. I usually like matte lippies so I leave this on for about 10 minutes then dab my lips a bit with a tissue paper and then apply my lipstick etc. Matte lippies can be drying so this prevents your lips from getting dried. You can also wear this alone for a glossy, everyday look. Lightweight and comfortable on the lips. 
I have received this product at no cost.",,19 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Perfect Pink Pouts,I love a good lip tint! This is a great product to help diminish the fine lines on your lips! I hate that lines show with matte lipstick and tints. This product also creates such a moisturized lippy for me and I have no need to apply chapstick. Love the pink color. I paired it with a pink lip stick which made it stand out even more. I‚Äôd be curious to see how the red tint would look on me.,Daffylovesdogs,19 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"This was supposed to be a hybrid lip gloss, balm, and treatment. 

Positives- the wand was unique and seemed to apply well. The formula itself didn‚Äôt feel super sticky and had a nice color to it. 

Negatives- in terms of a gloss, I didn‚Äôt feel like it had the high shine that I personally like when wearing a gloss and to get anything close to it, I had to apply a large amount. I also felt like it didn‚Äôt seem to hydrate my lips like a balm would. 

For someone interested in glosses that aren‚Äôt super tacky and shiny, this is the gloss for you. For anyone looking for a super shiny gloss or something more hydrating, I‚Äôd look for a different formula.",mmclick,18 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love this lip oil!,"Okay, so I'm picky about tinted lip oils. Some are too pigmented, too thin/thick/sticky or strangely drying. This one is quite nice. It's not sticky, the tint is subtle(which I love) and it's never made my lips feel dried out afterwards. I've used it alone and over the Haus Labs lip paint I received (as well as other matte lip stains/paints that I have) and it's been great to add some shine and hydration.

PHD Hybrid Lip Oil/ Sheer Pink by Haus Labs,"I received this product in exchange for my honest review thanks to @influenster and @hauslabs Have you ever struggled to find the perfect gloss that doesn‚Äôt wipe off easily or leave a harsh tacky feeling on your lips? Or have you struggled with glosses getting stuck to your hair? I have! When I was given the opportunity to try out this new PHD Hybrid Lip Oil I was really excited! I love that it is infused with prickly pear oil and collagen for hydration and high shine. This product does not leave that tacky heavy gloss residue on your lips. This lip oil has a doe foot applicator which is great for application and I love the size of this lip oil. It‚Äôs fits perfectly in to my makeup bag I take with me everywhere. I would‚Äôve like for this lip oil to come scented, but it‚Äôs fragrance free. It has no weird smell at all. The lip oil instantly hydrated your lips and leaves them feeling so soft and smooth. I used the shade Sheer Pink which is definitely a sheer shade because it just barely adds some natural hint of pink to your own lip color and adds high shine that doesn‚Äôt stick or feel uncomfortable. I am in love with this new product and have finally found the perfect lip oil I‚Äôve been wanting for the longest time now! I definitely recommend this product if you‚Äôre looking for a good hydration lip oil with minimal color and all the shine in a gloss. Thanks for this opportunity!! #influenster#cleanhaus#hauslabsbyladygaga#sephora#voxbox",JenniferStarr,18 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

I received the Power Sculpt Velvet Bronzer in Light Level 4, Bio-Radiant Gel-Powder Highlight inGolden Pyrite, Hy-Power Pigment Paint Blush Matte, Le Monster Lip Crayon Peach Matte, and PhD Lip Gloss in Tint. 

I love a great lip oil and this one did not disappoint. I love it. It goes on clear with barely a tiny.  It is not sticky but moisturizing and nourishing. 

I would highly recommend all of the products I received.",Andreab555,17 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Luxurious Lip Oil,"I love this little gem.  The oil feels so luxurious on my lips.  It makes them so incredibly soft.  It has a slight taste of vanilla.  I received the oil called ""Tint.""  It gives you a shade that will enhance your natural color of lips.  This fits perfectly in a pocket as they're a smaller size.  This is my new favorite lip oil.",candygirl277,17 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,This is one of the best lip oils I have used. My lips stay moisturized for a long time. I like the shade because it‚Äôs not very pink. I‚Äôm not into pink lips. It would be a 5 star review but I didn‚Äôt know this changed the color of your lips. It‚Äôs one of those products that make your lips very pink . I don‚Äôt like that. But other than that it‚Äôs great and I recommend,whosviah,16 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Better than expected,"Bought this on sale on amazon and I LOVE IT! Not sticky, pretty color, super hydrating. Only con is i have to reapply often but its not drying it just absorbs into my lips quickly. Its pricey for the amount of product. I got it for $7 but i would pay full price now that ive tried it :(",MeaganDanielle2,15 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Nice,I had never used a lip oil before this one. So I don‚Äôt have anything to compare it to. But I really like it. It‚Äôs not goopy like a lip gloss. It‚Äôs light & gives just a pop of color. It‚Äôs perfect for summer!,LinsJean,15 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Absolutely gorgeous sheer berry tint. Makes lips look and feel great. Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt get over the smell and taste. It was almost like meat fat. Difficult to describe. Typically I prefer things to be unscented but this could use a berry fragrance and flavour to mask whatever that weird smell and taste is. If you‚Äôre not sensitive to smell/taste (I am super particular) then give it a try. Everything else was 5/5 but I ended up returning it.,Anonymity7,14 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"great color, lackluster last","Grabbed the orange shade - loved the color and application. Would like more product for the price, as I find myself needing to reapply so so so often.",JGabe,14 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Nice,This Haus Labs by Lady Gaga sheer berry PHD Hybrid Lip Oil feels great and I live it over or under any of my lipsticks or pencils and alone. I wish the tint were noticable on my lips but I can't see it at all. There is no scent. I wish the tube was twice as large as it is because when I use it I use it multiple times through the day to keep my lips super smooth.,AnnazonDuca,11 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A little sticky,like more shine than color. It's very lightly tinted and it's a very very thick oil. To the point that if you use a bit too much it's kind of sticky. It's a nice product but be careful not to overdo it or you'll be fighting against sticky lips. I got this as a gift from Influenster but I always give a 100% honest review.,Tinaself29,11 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Must Have!,Formula is not sticky and it helps hydrate my lips all day! I am prone to cold sores whenever my lips get too dry due to the change of weather so this is very helpful! Love that I can just use it as is because of the tint!,janexco,10 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A hint of pint tint!,The Sheer Pink tint PhD Hybrid Lip Oil is reminiscent of old school beauty supply store lip gloss I used in middle school. Such a compliment!

looks nice.. doesn‚Äôt feel great,"Looks nice on your lips, however it was a leaning more towards pink rather than orange (I actually really like the sheer colour). That being said, it‚Äôs not a lip oil AT ALL - it‚Äôs a lip gloss. Super sticky and I feel like it won‚Äôt hydrate my lips that much. Not sure if I‚Äôll be keeping.

Great lip oil,"I love this lip oil! The color is stunning, very sheer but that‚Äôs what to expect/want from a lip oil in my opinion.

The price point is a little high for how long it lasts but I would purchase again because it feels amazing on the lips",courtneymw86,7 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not a sheer orange but‚Ä¶,"I love this colour , it doesn‚Äôt come out as a sheer orange though, it comes out as a really light pink.

Lip Oil,"I like how it makes my lips soft while I have it.
I love how it makes my lips slightly pink. I always love to have color on my lips. It looks very natural. The only thing I‚Äôm not sure is I don‚Äôt feel my lips super soft after using it. They are not dry, but when I don‚Äôt wear the oil I don‚Äôt feel them plump and hydrated. I wish there was this after effect if the lip oil.
I like the packaging- it doesn‚Äôt leak and fits into my purse.",Yoyo5,4 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
So hydrating,"I received this product as a free sample from Influenster and Haus Labs by Lady Gaga in exchange for my honest review. 

This was one of my favorite products! This lip oil is light weight and isn‚Äôt sticky at all. It also doesn‚Äôt have a smell if you were wondering. It gives a light tint to you lips which I really like and makes you lips feel so hydrated without the weight of a sticky lips gloss.",jackiieepc,4 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I enjoy it,It‚Äôs a nice lip oil that feels a little bit like a gloss but it isn‚Äôt sticky or too slippery. I do like how it adjusts to your ph. I kind of wish it had a fragrance but at the same time I appreciate that it has no scent or flavor. I‚Äôm quite pleased with this lip oil.,chiqquitabanana,4 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
New favorite lip oil!,"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.  The lip oil comes in a white cardboard box which could possibly be dye-free and recycled giving a nod to its clean beauty label.  I appreciate clean beauty products and feel they are a good movement by this rebrand!  The product itself is housed in a clear square bottle with silver top.  It‚Äôs short size and simple packaging make it a great product to throw in your purse for every day wear.  The applicator is comfortable and easy to apply the product with.  The oil itself is not as plush of a formula as many of the other oils I own, however, it still provides that hydrating and nourishing feel to the lips.  I have the color Tint and it is true to its description of sheer pink.  It leaves my lips shiny with a hint of color which has been my go to look this summer.  My favorite part of this formula is how it stains the lips as you wear it.  The oil seems to darken the lips as you wear it and even once it‚Äôs removed, it leaves behind a flush of pink.  This is an innovative feature to this formula and I love it!  I am unsure whether this is a feature of all of the shades, but I hope so!  I definitely recommend this product to anyone who enjoys lip stains and lip oils!  My new favorite for sure!",ConnieM1216,3 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Light and lovely!,"I expected this to be tacky (sticky) but it wore really light and easy. It lasted longer than most glosses I‚Äôve tried without being heavy or thick. I was also worried that it would be too wet looking for daywear/casual wear but it‚Äôs not. I love that it‚Äôs all vegan ingredients. The pink shade is a fun pop! pink.

Soo hydrating!,"I was skeptical about this product when I first got it, but it's pretty awesome. This lip oil has a slight pink hugh to it and a glossy [but not sticky] feel.

Great color,I love this lip oil because it isn‚Äôt too sticky! It also only takes one layer to get a great color. The pink is nice and vibrant - perfect for a day look! I added a lipstick under it for going out at night.,CCHuffman,2 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

The cap can be used as a mirror which is a nice added feature. I also love the clear packaging. You‚Äôll see right away when it‚Äôs time to restock your new favorite lip oil!

The flexible, cushiony soft applicator tip makes it easy to apply the lip oil all over the lips. I‚Äôve never been a fan of lip gloss but can never say no to a good lip oil. This lip oil does not feel oily but will leave your lips shiny. It forms a non sticky layer on top of the lips which helps to lock in moisture.

I love the subtle pink tint which adds just the right amount of color to my lips. Hybrid Lip Oil can be worn by itself, or over any lipstick.",SMolina1175,2 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I‚Äôm honestly not sure what I was expecting with the lip oil versus the lip gloss, but this applies very much so like a lip gloss that is more moisturizing. It is not oily at all.

,"Skip Secondary it is pink not orange. I am in love with Sheer Pink and use it all the time, I usually wear different lip products every day but I have only been wearing this lip oil since I got it two weeks ago. I ordered Secondary thinking it would be a more neutral color but it turns pink and is the exact same color as secondary. I'm not mad bc I'll still use it but not sure why they marketed it as ornate knowing it would turn pink on everyone's lips. Also it just annoys me when brands market the color changing thing as ""PH"" it has nothing to do with PH it's just an ingredient that reacts to heat, nothing more. But all of that aside, I love love love this product. Eveything dries my lips it but this does not, my lips has a pretty color for hours after applying and it is not sticky/tacky.",cortezthekiller,1 Jul 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Wanted To Love This,"First Haus labs product and I was so excited because it had a 98% rating. i loveeee a berry shade and loveee lip oils so this was a dream come true to me! Sadly, it is not replacing my Milani fruit fetish lip oil. The applicator is a doe foot, yet it barely picks up any product. The product itself is a pretty color but it was way too sticky, clung to dry patches, and wore off every five minutes. I couldn‚Äôt be more disappointed. A lot of these positive reviews are incentivized :(",claudiac21,29 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

"Pretty, but not worth it?","The shade is pretty and feels nice on my lips, but it doesn‚Äôt last. If I used this as my lip color during a day out, I feel like I‚Äôd be reapplying it every 10 minutes or so.

Wanted to love it,I wanted to love this especially as I just got a lip blushing and was hoping this was all I would need on my lips moving forward.

Don‚Äôt let the bright color scare you away, it adds a beautiful hint of color that‚Äôs pretty natural looking.",AllisonRae8,26 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Blown Away!,These are the best lip oil‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever tried! The color is so pigmented and the lip oil itself is very hydrating. I‚Äôve been wearing it everyday since I received it and it lasts such a long time before having to re-apply. I even wear it to bed and when I wake up my lips are such a beautiful tinted pink color and hydrated. Definitely worth the $,vvsdiamantej,26 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Gorgeous color,"I received this from Influenster and Haus Labs themselves to test for my honest opinion. This lip oil has given my lips life. Most lol products break me out, I am able to use ABH, NYX, and Wet n Wild only and this product doesn‚Äôt make my lips peel. This lip oil is sooo gorgeous, layered with vaseline lip therapy, the Haus lip crayon with this lip oil on top. I like that after the gloss goes away the lip crayon leaves in matte, then it‚Äôs easy to reapply especially like after you eat and have a drink. It‚Äôs so gorgeous and the shine is everything. This is everything I‚Äôd totally recommend this to anyone!",RicanArabBabe,26 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,It feels nice and the wand is great. I found it just doesn‚Äôt last. I was reapplying every few minutes. It‚Äôs a small amount and I don‚Äôt think it will last long.,pdhart,26 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love it,I had never tried lip oil before. I loved using this product. The lip oil made my lips so soft and nice. We won‚Äôt feel sticky but it hydrated my lips. It‚Äôs an addition to my lip care now.,Resh1001,26 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Subtle hint of color and shine,I absolutely love this lip oil.  It leaves a glossy finish with a subtle hint of color that naturally brightens your face. I look forward to trying the rest of the colors.,h0lysug4r,26 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I really liked this lip oil. It is shiny abut smooth and not at all sticky. It is a nice sheer hue and can be worn by it self or layered over another lip color to add moisture and shine.,maceyalexandria,26 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Lightweight and comfortable,"I was really impressed with this product! It gives a high shine finish without feeling heavy or sticky like some other lip oils. At the end of the day, my lips still felt hydrated. It also layered nicely on top of other lip products.",brenadvisor,25 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Great product,I loved the subtle shine this product gave to my lips plus the lip wand is soooooo nice!,SkinWithElisa,25 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

It doesn't feel sticky, on the contrary, it leaves my lips really moisturized and apart from that it has a beautiful tone that makes my lips look radiant and smooth!  Widely recommended!",PololaAle99,25 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I was questioning the pigment when I bought this, but it‚Äôs there and super pretty. Not sticky at all and
no scent. Lips feel soft after first use. It isn‚Äôt long lasting and the shine factor is less compared to other products. The pigment didn‚Äôt stain my lips. Just wish it would give a plump appearance like others & last longer, especially with the cost.",Ashell,24 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Better than Dior!,"Ok wanna know why it‚Äôs better? Non sticky, better color pat off. More skin benefits this stuff is loaded with peptides. Seriously once I‚Äôm done with my Laneige this will be my new night treatment as well. So yeah, there‚Äôs no losing. Ever! The formula lasts and is so comfortable on the lips.",SexyJord,24 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"This is the first lip oil I've tried, and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't feel super oily on my lips! The tint gave a nice shade to my lips. I'm not usually a glossy lip kind of gal, so I don't think I'd purchase, but if you love a gloss this is a good one!",FriskyArtifact,24 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I‚Äôm confused by the lip oil. I really expected this to be moisturizing and nourishing. It‚Äôs not, beautiful shine right away, but dried out my lips.  Would try again if the formula changed.",AshleyHobbs10,24 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Big fan! Never used lip oil before- not too oily just the right texture and gives an awesome shine,jsjsggdusuisyeh,24 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,This lip oil was okay. Im not the biggest fan on a ‚Äúlip gloss‚Äù finish as this creates but it did smell nice and had a nice tint to it. It did however leave my lips feeling nice and soft,jesjas123,24 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Best lip oil,Highly recommended this lip oil I use it every night to wake up in the morning with some soft lips,cita12,24 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,"This lip is sensational, recommended for those days when you are looking for subtlety to steal your eyes but in a natural way, it enhances the color of your lips and keeps them hydrated, perhaps suggested for events or family gatherings",MariaCg03,23 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love it!,"This is a great lip oil! It‚Äôs not sticky, it‚Äôs has a nice sheer hue that leave a slight tint to my lips. I find this to be very comparable to Dior and Clarins lip oil! Lasts long enough. Only complaint is the applicator could be bigger but overall I love it.",daisy1,23 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Very pretty and goes on easy. I don‚Äôt usually use colored things on my lips but this didn‚Äôt disappoint !,bmalbertini,23 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

A new must-have!,"This lip oil is AMAZING.  It's smooth, not sticky, and light-weight. The sheer orange is my favorite color, but I have each one and they all look beautiful on the lips.

,Not worth the price. The tint is a garish shade of pepto bishop pink. Cheap packaging too!,suzyb1,23 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Better than a lip gloss!,"My wife loves this Haus Labs by Lady Gaga PhD Lip Oil: An award-winning, clean tinted lip oil that delivers lightweight hydration and non-sticky shine. 

Let‚Äôs start with packaging that it‚Äôs almost as stunning as Lady Gaga herself!

She said it may look a plain lip gloss, but as soon as you put it on, you'll see the difference- it‚Äôs a gorgeous pink. It's a bit sticky, but not in
an annoying way. She even said, that she would prefer using this rather than her normal lip gloss.  Not only does it condition her lips that they feel so much smoother and healthy, it gives a great life and shine to them. It felt very natural on the lips. It was highly pigmented and flexible! She also love using them as multitaskers (ie: cheek, lip & eye)! This will look great on anyone with light to medium skintones with neutral to warm undertones. Just buy them, for sure you will fall in love with it!",123LesGo,23 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Hated it,Doesn‚Äôt seem like lip oil. Very sticky and  barely deposited any color on my lips. Really disappointed because I‚Äôd so many good reviews on it. I even read the box because I thought maybe I had gotten the wrong product.,sweetlilac,22 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Great Lip Oil,"I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for my honest review. This lip oil is the best gloss I‚Äôve ever put on my lips. It‚Äôs smooth and not greasy or sticky. It‚Äôs also very hydrating. I love the effect of lip gloss, but the reason I stopped wearing it is because the ones I‚Äôve tried were very sticky. I hated when I was wearing lip gloss and the wind blew my hair across my lips and stuck on there. Not so with this lip oil. I like to put on a dark lip liner and then put the oil on over it and blend it. It adds color to the gloss and creates a gorgeous look that I receive lots of compliments on. This has become a daily staple and I keep it in my purse. I‚Äôd like to try some other shades.",TuffyNuff,22 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

"Absolutely worth it, amazing product!!",Absolutely LOVE!! I‚Äôm a bartender while in college and always on the go! This is quick and easy during crazy rushes and able to rehydrate my lips and give them the PERFECT amount of color so that they look a little more lively!

Please please make more colors that are colored enough to show up more like Hue does!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,RoseH1ll,22 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"So far the best product I‚Äôve purchased from the revamped Haus Labs line. The color is very barely there on me, I haven‚Äôt noticed any ph change, but it‚Äôs a lot more sheer than the bottle suggests. Not really sticky or overly thick. It‚Äôs a lot like the Clarins Lip Oil, only slightly thicker. It‚Äôs hydrating, not very long lasting, but shiny, and has worn away evenly.",Den78,22 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
liked the formula just not the shade,Feels super hydrating and lightweight on the lips almost like you‚Äôre wearing nothing. Bought the shade ‚Äúsheer berry‚Äù & the shade immediately turns into this almost bright red shade. I don‚Äôt like it on my skin tone so I‚Äôm returning for the fenty lip oil or another Dior lip oil,Kiababyyy,21 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
perfect for the summer!,"I love this lip oil! The tint is so pretty and you can layer it to create a more intense look. This is perfect as a prep step, it moisturizes and adds a nice tint. I also like this as a topper, it will add a pink tint but I love it!",Denise2019,21 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

just wasn‚Äôt it,"I wanted to be obsessed with this product but I just wasn‚Äôt impressed.  It is comfortable and scent-free and lasted a little under an hour in my lips.  I purchased the Hue shade expecting some tiny but it was barely visible.  For the size of the product and price, I think there are much better products in the market with comparable results.",b902,21 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Good Tint,I like this lip oil. I really wish it was flavored. That‚Äôs my only negative for this product. It makes my lips super soft and I like the size of the bottle. I would recommend this product,Cthomas1019,20 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Shiny,This feels so good on my lips!! I paired it with black liner and loved how it came out. It‚Äôs not sticky at all and gives a beautiful shine!,cortakneejay,20 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
i love it :),"it‚Äôs such a nice, comfortable product. hydrating and non-sticky with a beautiful sheen. reminiscent of the dior lip oil. i‚Äôm giving 4 stars because the applicator is a bit uncomfy; it‚Äôs too small and slightly unflexible.",coldtoeshoe,20 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Hydrating,"Haus Labs PHD Hybrid Lip Oil in Tint looks like a shade that will turn your lips bright pink. However, it has just a slight tint to it that doesn‚Äôt really look different on the lips.  I do like the hydration that this lip oil gives.  The PHD Hybrid Lip Oil is very comfortable, but it‚Äôs not meant to go out n today of another lip product as it will lift the color off.",mfsyarns,20 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I‚Äôm obsessed!,I love this so much! I was not expecting so much pigment in a lip oil but this did not disappoint. I have already ordered a 2nd one,Heather0716,20 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

"Live, love this lip oil that isn't like other oils","I love the way this lip oil feels! It's very smooth and light without the stickiness that most lip oils have. My only issue, and rain for 4of 5 stars, is that it could have a smidge more color. It doesn't look like there's any color when it's on. Otherwise, I totally recommend this product for anyone!!! Thanks  @hauslabs and @influenster for this product!!!!

My favorite from Haus Labs,"This is a great lip oil! Very comfortable on lips, gives a little hydration, not heavy, not sticky. It leaves a slight tint but it‚Äôs not too noticeable on my pigmented lips. 

Similar to Dior Lip Oil, the difference is that this has a thinner texture. I love both!",abc1111,19 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I love this product!,im officially obsessed! i love the sheer pink color it leaves on my lips! It also doesn't leave your lips sticky like other lip glosses do!,nailinitwithmeg,19 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Better than the Dior lip oil by a milestone,"Personally, I think it‚Äôs way better than the Dior lip oil, after the gloss comes off it leaves a gorgeous stain. Plus it isn‚Äôt sticky so when the wind hits it‚Äôs not getting in my hair",HayHay0824,18 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Overall not bad,I was super excited to try this as I've been looking for a lip product like this.  I'm not sure I'd call it an oil as it's definitely more of a gloss consistency but it isn't too sticky (one of my biggest complaints with glosses) and it adds a nice subtle color and shine.  Overall very happy I got to test this and will continue to use it!,Llouwho,18 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Perfect for spring & summer!,"I love this lip oil. My only complaint is I wish it lasted a bit longer. But the applicator is well-made and not cheap, and applies it smoothly. The formula is great, not sticky, and it doesn‚Äôt pill like a lot of other glosses I‚Äôve tried over the years. 
The color is a pretty, light pink, and it looks great on my pale skin. It‚Äôs perfect for spring and summer!",invisiblechaos,18 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Moisturizing Lip Oil,I received this product free from Influenster and Haus Labs by Lady Gaga in exchange for my honest review. The lip oil is very moisturizing and makes my lips feel soft. The color & sheen go well with darker skin tones. Lightweight and not heavy. The only downside is the stain could appear darker and last longer. I have to apply multiple times during the day.,Marleyshep,18 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Not my favorite,I wasn‚Äôt sure about this from the start but it goes on like lipgloss but doesn‚Äôt last long. I honestly use it more for going to bed to moisturize but I don‚Äôt know if it really shows much color that I‚Äôd wear in public,StephK2014,18 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Hydrating,Really liked this oil because it doesn‚Äôt feel sticky (like Dior does for me)! Color and sheen are great and I‚Äôd love to try the orange tint as well! Only complaint is I wish it lasted a bit longer after application.,rfwagner14,17 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"OK, not great","This is the only product out of the  new line that I am not so impressed with. It is a perfectly fine loss, but it is not super thick, it doesn't last very long, and it is not very colorful. I almost like looking at it more than I like using it.",GB78,17 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Right amount of gloss.,"LOVED THIS. High shine, not sticky and great amount of tint. I used it on top of the pencil and it added a tough top coat. Also vegan friendly.",zelaikha,17 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

"Soft, plump, unsticky lips","My favorite lip oil ever. I‚Äôve tried a few because I really love the extra moisture and gloss like finish but I‚Äôve found most to be just as sticky and thick as regular gloss.

Love this lip oil,"The Tint color is so pretty in the little bottle but doesn‚Äôt make your lips super pink which i like. Its just the right, subtle amount of color. It‚Äôs not sticky and feels super lightweight and hydrating. The wand/applicator is so soft and in my opinion thicker/wider than most makeup applicators.

My Favorite Lip Oil Yet!,"I love this lip oil! It feels great on, and is very hydrating and not sticky. I got Hue - Sheer Berry and the tint is very natural. I think I like this applicator size and the amount of product on the applicator - better than Clarins or Fenty... it's a tad smaller and has less product on it - and this works better for my lips.",Pokeey,14 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"Despite the color, it‚Äôs sheer with just a little tint of pink. It‚Äôs an oil, but heavier than other oil type lip products I‚Äôve used. With it being thicker, it helps it stay & last longer, just wish it had more moisturizing benefits that I could see.",ColeWorld29,14 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

After finishing this, I think I‚Äôll definitely be repurchasing another one!",Leeahx,14 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Berry Unique,I luv'd it. It gave the right amount of shine. It was not tacky at all. My ONLY disappointment was that it didn't last beyond 2 hours after application. And that's without drinking nor eating anything. I still would purchase in other shades.,CheriJB,14 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Perfect,"I loved receiving this product, I really wanted to try a product like this and I loved it, this gloss leaves a slight touch of color, plus it leaves the lips very pretty without being sticky or too heavy.

Beautiful colour!,"Haus labs by lady gaga phd hybrid lip oil tint sheer pink. Beautiful colour, slippery not sticky like a good lip oil should be. This is the best lip oil moisturizer ever. It goes on smoothly and stays on and your lips feel super moisturized. It‚Äôs very long lasting and it‚Äôs the best lip oil moisturizer ever. This leaves just a sheer, slightly shimmery layer of translucent pink on my lips. Perfect, especially for summer. Very happy with this product. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this. Apply a glassy layer of PhD HYBRID LIP OIL and watch it melt down and react to your own pH, leaving behind a long-lasting, true-to-you tint. BUILD with additional layers for a deeper tint and longer lip-loving benefits. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.",Lupeter,13 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Awesome lip oil!,"I received this lip oil from influenster to try and all opinions are mine. This lip oil is amazing! I received the sheer pink and leaves a slight pink tint on my lips. The formula is thicker but not sticky in any way. I love using this when I want a little color and not have to wear lipstick.

My new favorite Lippie!,"I've used lip oils before but never fell in love with one. I got this lip oil from Influenster and Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for my honest review and I can honestly say I prefer using this to my normal lip gloss. Not only does it condition my lips that they feel so much smoother and healthy, it gives a great life and shine to them. I got the berry tint and it gives the perfect amount of color for a clean and natural look. Rubbing your lips together it wasn't sticky and It didn't affect the wear or use. I just let it set for a moment before rubbing my lips together. It felt very natural on my lips. I love that it is clean beauty. This whole collection of skincare-infused makeup is clean, vegan, and cruelty-free which for me is such a plus because all of the makeup that I buy I make sure if cruelty free. Best part is after using it for a week my lips feel so much softer and full of life!",Famato,10 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

But seriously I love the texture and durability and the color that it leaves on my lips I only think that it should have a good scent. Maybe fruits. But I recommend.",Elizflores,10 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Gorgeous and comfortable wear,I absolutely love this lip oil! I'm usually not a fan of glossed and have avoided them for YEARS-- but when I tried this I was pleasantly surprised.

"nice, but nothing special","I enjoyed this product. It felt great. I would use it again but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something I would repurchase. I had no problems with this at all. I don‚Äôt really see any color pay off at all for me personally, but the shade is fairly close to my actual lip color. I don‚Äôt think it altered the other lip products I was wearing. This would also be nice on its own. It doesn‚Äôt add shine that would compare to a lip gloss but it does add enough shine for a more naturally shiny look on its own. I would consider purchasing the clear formula, but overall it didn‚Äôt wow me enough for this to be a staple in my routine",slabbyy,10 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Nice but sticky,"I really liked this as my lips often get dry because I never drink enough water. When I got put it on I wasn't sure about it because it was sticky, but after it was on for a while it was just fine. I like this way more than chapstick or any variation because those make my lips dry out more, which did not happen with this lip oil.",zombieauthor,10 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Smooth and not sticky!,This is stunning and I happened to get a great color for my skin tone. The sheer pink adds just enough color that it looks natural while enhancing my lip color.,SamsonMarley,10 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I received this product free from Influenster & haus labs in exchange for an honest review.

Of all the products I received this unfortunately was my least favorite. It felt thin and comfortable on the lips but it wore away rather quickly and was not shiny for very long. Since it is PH-based the color went very pink on me which wasn‚Äôt flattering, I can‚Äôt say that I was wowed by it to try a different shade",aviscardi,10 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

You Need This Lip Oil!,"Haus Labs by Lady Gaga
PhD Lip Oil in Tint (pink) 

I received this product for free from
Influenster and Haus Labs in exchange for my honest review.

I love the modern packaging and doe foot applicator!  It was easy and comfortable to apply. Instantly lips were hydrated, plumped, and glossy without a sticky feeling. The formula is very lightweight. The staying power of this was about 3 hours then it looked more like a stain. I do not mind reapplying when it looks this good and is so comfortable. I love the shade of pink. I have tried other lip oils and have not fell in love. This one I really love!  I just ordered it today in the orange/peach color called Secondary. 

I love clean beauty. This whole collection of skincare-infused makeup is clean, vegan, and cruelty-free.

High shine!,"When I received this from Haus Labs and Influenster, I really thought it was going to be a thin oil, but instead is a thick and shiny lip gloss! I used it for 4 days before writing this review and I'm really loving it. I am 66 and my lips are usually dry and this is very moisturizing. My lips feel softer and plumper, and I've found that if I use a smaller amount before bed, I wake up with soft lips with a very pretty light pink tint. It does come off easily when eating or drinking and has to be reapplied often throughout the day/night, but it's really pretty and looks great by itself or over a lipstick of similar shade. I'm looking forward to trying other shades!",kb850,9 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Obsessed!,Obsessed! I usually stay away from lip oils because they dry my lips out but I did not have that issue with this one. It was very moisturizing and gave a perfect pink tint.

Super hydrating,I received Haus‚Äô Lip Oil in Tint for free in exchange for my honest review. I found this particular lip out to be super hydrating with a nice sheet wash of color. It glides on nicely and not sticky in the slightest. No funny smell or taste either which is always such a huge plus!! I put my mask on like 5ish minutes after applying and it didn‚Äôt stick to my mouth unlike some of my other products. It does look a bit darker in person than online but it is a nice sheer pink color when you put it on. I like the small container size - will be perfect to chuck in my tiny summer purses!

It‚Äôs ok,"I received it for free from Influenster. 
You guys can see the difference between the upper lip with lip oil and the lower lip without lip oil. The other lipstick is thick, which is what I don't like because it feels heavy on the lips. And each time I apply lipstick, the lip oil came out very little.  looks like this is a design to save lipoil :))",ToffeeLove,8 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Shiny but‚Ä¶,"The packaging is so cute and I love the color and shine of this lip oil. However, I have always had an issue with lip glosses, oils, sticks, etc drying out my lips.

I would recommend if you don‚Äôt have an issue with dry lips already.",Hotmessmama25,8 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Love the sleek packaging.,"Have to say I‚Äôm really surprised at the color payoff for this shade that I‚Äôm seeing in the other reviews. The sheer pink I received is just that- (very) sheer-ly pink.
That aside I like this lip gloss. It is the most often used of everything I received this week. I like that it performs very similar to another lip balm I really like, in that it helps your lips to retain moisture the whole time you‚Äôre wearing it instead of sapping that moisture to stay glossy.
My favorite way to wear this gloss is on top of lip stain,  so these days, I opt for berry red and orange and use them to make an ombr√© effect before adding the gloss on top.",1ttrium,8 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,"I received this item from Influenster and HAUS Labs by Lady Gaga for my review 

Y‚Äôall this lip oil is to dye for. I love the feel of this on my lips and I love the little bit of color this leaves behind. Most lip oils/gloss makes me feel like my lips are sticky and very heavy.

Luxurious,"I have never tried a lip oil before and this felt luxurious! It was light, non-sticky and just gave that natural pop of pink with a beautiful shine. I love this little applicator too! I reapplied about three times while out and about, which is about the same as my favorite lip glosses. In the picture I posted, I had already had it on for over an hour without reapplying. I may be making the switch to lip oil from now on since it is so smooth and lasting!",Jensreviews,7 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
A non-sticky gloss alternative,"I received this product for free compliments of Influenster and Haus Labs.

I love how it feels on my lips! I deal with chapped lips, and cold weather. While it's been warm since I got this, I am still very glad to have it. It has a gentle scent like most lip glosses or oils, but isn't tacky like a gloss or leave you feeling like your hair is going to catch in your makeup!

I wish it had a bit more color to it, which is why I dropped a star, but I'm certainly more of a fan of color than not.",MeggFlick,7 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Custom Shade of Pink - Hydrating and Not Sticky!,"I haven‚Äôt been able to get my hands on the Dior lip glow so was super excited to try this.

When I first swatched this on my hand it looked totally sheer, but then changed to a beautiful pink tone based on the PH of my skin. 

To test this product, I didn‚Äôt have any product on my lips beforehand and they were fairly dry. They immediately looked hydrated and the formula sticks without being sticky. It gave a gorgeous glow without being too pigmented.

,"My lip skin is erratic, with just a little peeling and, most uncomfortably, cracks. Constant attention and nutrient application are required. 
This lip oil has the following advantages: 
1. removes peeling from the lips completely in one day 
2. nourishes and smoothes the skin of the lips perfectly 
3. pleasant texture, comfortably lies on the lips, does not feel or shine excessively 
4. It is not sticky at all, which is a huge plus for me because I dislike it when my lips are sticky or my hair sticks to my lips due to the product on them.

Love it!,"Usually I don't like lip glosses very much because they tend to be very sticky, and they stick to everything, but this one is not sticky at all, it's moisturizing and soft, I love it!",Flamenquilla,6 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Eh Product,"The tint works really fast. Has a very thin consistency and not sticky at all! Better consistency than the Dior Lip oil. 

I didn‚Äôt like the applicator since i couldn‚Äôt grab a lot of product. It also didn‚Äôt last very long. The tint went away within 30 min.",beyeezus,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,The perfect dupe for the Dior lip oil! The formula is so hydrating and moisturizing. The shade is super versatile for all skin tones.,pav1978,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Great lip oil,"I always been afraid to use a lip oil because I thought it would be too greasy. I always chose a stick moisturizer,  well this lip oil is NOT greasy at all, very hydrating but not greasy with a subtle/ perfect tint, and slightly plumping result. I definitely recommend it. I can't wait to purchase the clear one.",ahuidor,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"i received this product from Influenster for my honest review. I love the lip oil, but pink isn‚Äôt my color. I prefer nudes and browns on me, but the color wasn‚Äôt too bad. I applied this lip oil over the lip crayon and it was pretty, but just not me. If you‚Äôre not into pinks I would totally recommend a different shade.",2511yaya,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I really loved this lip oil. It‚Äôs a very light weight and not sticky at all which is a big plus . Would highly recommend.,Nengneng,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Nice Lip Oil,I like this lip oil. It is hydrating and very vim on the lips. Also like the sheer pink shade. This is Vegan and cruelty free. Perfect for everyday.,socialbnb,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Hydrating lip oily with a nice tint,The lip oil went on silky and is hydrating. I love the color because the tint is light and natural looking. I can wear it out or during the day and it looks great.,Kurtylove,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Great Lip Oil!,"I received this product from Influenster for my honest review. I was surprised to love this lip oil. It goes on similar to lip gloss but is not as sticky. I used the sheer pink tint, and it is very subtle. The color did not transfer when I drank out of a cup. It is hydrating and even after a few hours, I did not feel as if my lips had dried out from using it.",ohmywyrd,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
This is actually really good,This lip oil is surprisingly really good. The tint is a very sheer light tint. I almost didn‚Äôt notice It but either way it was fine to me. This is not a thick sticky lip oil but it is not thin either. I am shocked by the quality of this lip oil. Pleasantly surprised.,STBrantley,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,This lip oil is sheer and hydrating but provides a great tint of color. Super sleek packaging and small enough to fit in a clutch or mini bag. Hydrating and shiny without being sticky.,peonies23,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
‚ù§Ô∏è,This lip oil is amazing! ‚ù§Ô∏è The lip oil is so moisturizing and isn‚Äôt heavy on the lips. The tint is just right too and gives a more natural look. I highly recommend!,Carlie2014,5 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

,"You can‚Äôt tell at first when putting it on that your lips are a different color.  It was shiney on my lips, but I couldn‚Äôt tell it was a different color until I wiped it off.  I thought it was sticky and I am not a huge fan of lip color. If you like a subtle lip this is for you.",laurenmmorlando,4 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,I really like this product when I want a bit of gloss without the stickiness!! The color is beautiful and subtle and goes really well on top of the Le Monster Lip Crayon in Peach Matte.,suzannetsai,4 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Pretty color!,"I received this as product from Influencer in exchange for a review. Before forming an opinion on this product, I tried it out over the course of 2 days. I do love that it does not have any fragrance and it feels very good upon application. It is not super thick or too thin. The color I received gave my lips a pretty sheer wash of berry color. The problem came a few hours later when the oil wore off. Instead of leaving my lips moist and hydrated, which I‚Äôd expect from an oil, they felt dried out. I had to constantly keep applying this product so my lips wouldn‚Äôt feel dry and shriveled up. If you want a lip oil with a little bit of color and don‚Äôt mind that it doesn‚Äôt last long, this would work.",beautyjunkie42,4 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Divine!,"Absolutely divine! First the domefoot applicator is a larger than the ones you normally get. It‚Äôs feels soft on the lips and is large enough that one application covers both lips. The formula is hydrating and moisturizing. Great for those that have dry lips like me. It‚Äôs non sticky, non greasy and feels rich! The consistency is perfect. I don‚Äôt like heavy sticky formulas. Much nicer than a lip gloss and best thing is my hair doesn‚Äôt stick to it! The color is not as Instrnse as the bottle. Gives a nice sheer tint. Can be worn with or without lipstick/lip liner. Formula lasts for most of the day. I only had to reapply after eating. I will def be buying the other colors.",Mela74,4 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
I loved,"I got impressed with this lip oil because my lips
looked like more pink. I used it as a gloss and I loved
the result! My lips are thin and it left them look a little
bit more voluminous. In my opinion it's not so sticky! I
recommend this 100%.",AnaMelo,4 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,Holy crap! This lip oil is AMAZING. Soooooo moisturizing and the tint is just right. Highly recommend this product if you want hydrating lips + a trendy look.,ggreviewsthings,4 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"LOVE, LOVE THIS.","I couldn't remember if I reviewed this yet, so forgive me if this is on here twice. Tired Momma. PHD HYBRID LIP OIL in color SHEER PINK. I received these products, HAUS LABS By LADY GAGA free in exchange for an honest review from Influenster Oh man, I love this. It‚Äôs so smooth. It‚Äôs not sticky or thick. It does this magic of making my lips look fuller. In an 8 hour day, you will have to apply around 3 times. I think that‚Äôs pretty normal for this type of product, so I am not mad at it. The wand had a Q-tip shape, nice for quick application. I love this color, as it adds just a touch to my natural lip color. I put some on before bed last night, I woke up with it still on, and my lips were so soft.  It‚Äôs very hydrating. Another product that I love and would purchase.
Overall I am very impressed. The products range from $24 to $40 making this a very affordable product for everyone.",JennHM,4 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Clear on the go,"HAUS LABS BY LADY GAGA

,This is my first lip oil and I do appreciate the formula being clean and non stick. It is very hydrating and the perfect tint. I would use again!,MorgBaxt,3 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
Dare I say perfect?,"Packaging: The packaging (outer and inner) is beautiful and *feels* luxurious. I was curious about the materials used for packaging so I did some research and read that their goal is to use and source environmentally friendly packaging. So, major props for that! 

Product: Normally with vegan and fragrance-free products they have a yucky taste, but I'm very please that this product has no smell and no taste which means I will be using this product often. The color comes across as bold, but it actually enhances your natural lip color. The formula isn't too sticky and it isn't too runny; perfect medium. My lips were actually a little dry when I applied the product and I could feel it hydrating my lips almost instantly. 

I will be buying this again.",katiemarietork,3 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
,"I (surprisingly) love this lip oil! I swear by my vaseline chapstick religiously so when I received this free sample from Influenster I wasn't too interested in it but tried it anyway. I really love the way it sits on my lips and makes my lips feel so soft and moisturized! It's not really a sticky feel on my lips and as the day went on, the tint in it left the prettiest shade of pink on my lips! I really love this product and will excited to get some other shades next time I'm at Sephora!",JerzeeGworl,3 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

Perfect pink for me,"This is the perfect pink color for me. When you first put it on, it looks almost clear. Then the magic happens. It does not feel sticky at all, but otherwise feels like a gloss. It applies easily. My only gripe would be that it wears off quickly, so reapplication is a must.

The packaging is simple and clean.",lovelyk864,2 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

"Lasting, hydrating oil tint","I received this product for free from Influenster and Haus Labs in exchange for my honest review. It is the pHD Hybrid lip oil in Tint which will be released on June 9Th, 2022. 0.25 oz. I was impressed when opening my vox box to a set of Haus Labs new full sizes to try. The packaging looked clean and sleek with the off white inkless minimized boxes. The lip oil looks classic in its silver and clear rectangular tube. I found no discernible scent from the rich berry glossy lip oil. It left just a hint of color for me and the gel like texture dried down quickly so I didn‚Äôt get the tackiness I often find from thick lip oil products. Two hours later I can still feel some silkiness on my lips, so I know it is still working and hasn‚Äôt dried them out, either. No feathering or extending beyond the lip has been noticed like oil and balm can do. No odd taste noted either. I can see this becoming a purse staple.",Rubiegem8280,1 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

I love the high shine and that it last for a while. It‚Äôs not thick. There‚Äôs no taste or smell to it either. It‚Äôs very small and compact and I can carry it in my pocket. I would totally buy this product again. I love it.",DragonBabe,1 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes

It‚Äôs a perfect balance between oil and balm. My lips feel so smooth and nourished with this on. And the Tint color is beautiful. I don‚Äôt usually wear color on my lips, but this provides just a subtle pink hue that makes my lips appear fuller. I‚Äôm not big on lip glosses in general, but I‚Äôm really loving this product!",averylayne,1 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
"Bold, yet subtle enough for everyone.","A beautiful pop of color. Hydrating, soft & silky. This formula is not sticky or overwhelming, the way or glosses tend to be. It is unscented, which I also appreciate. I can't wait to try it in ""Secondary"" (which I think will compliment my skin tone better).

Pro tip: for a ""your lips, but better"" look - 30 minutes after application, blot & apply a THIN layer of tinted moisturizer on top. Pure perfection. (See photos for both application types.)",Anonymity,1 Jun 2022,HausLabs,Lip,Yes
