my new obsession,31 Jan 2025,Melissstark,"i rarely write beauty reviews, because sadly i’m rarely impressed. 
so so so impressed. by far the best mascara i’ve ever used!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
4 of 5,30 Jan 2025,lilycavv,"I was super excited to try this product. First application, I loved the wand to apply the product. It didn’t win me over first try, I didn’t like the way my eyelashes looked at first. Then as I continued to apply it after a few days I did seek to like it more and more. It made my eyelashes look full. One thing to note, this mascara is NOT waterproof.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
love it,30 Jan 2025,lianamarie1,"I love it, made my lashes look like falsies. Only thing is, it does hold my lashes up but only after I went back in with my lash curler. When its first applied it will weigh your lashes down and you will have to go in and curl them again, if you're looking for something that will hold without having to go back in with your lash curler I don't suggest this for you, but i think it's a good product.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Super nice mascara,30 Jan 2025,burningisis,I really like using this mascara it doesn’t flake off and it gives a good natural thickness. I have used this on both lashes and natural lashes and it is good on both.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must have!,30 Jan 2025,BrightonSkye,"Makes my lashes fuller, longer, more voluminous. Easy to apply, the wand is fantastic. No gross clumps! My only issue is as a person with light colored eyes I squint and blink a lot and need waterproof to avoid raccoon eyes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara,29 Jan 2025,BLynee,"Love this mascara it’s got volume, proper thickness, and color also lasts all day and washes off gently. The one thing about it to love is the super softness!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great for straight lashes,28 Jan 2025,alambchop,"Great for straight lashes hesitant to curl. I normally have to get waterproof otherwise wetter formulas weight down my lashes, but I like this formula and it’s easy to take off at the end of the day.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,25 Jan 2025,robweezy,I only gave 4 stars because it tends to transfer after application. It has amazing length and volume I was very impressed with the way it separated each lash and it looked beautiful,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Little heavy but good,25 Jan 2025,Sassyitgirl,I have long lashes but they are very thin. So any mascara that is heavy makes me look like a raccoon very quickly.  This mascara is a bit on the heavier side but didn’t cause the issue.  I would use it again. I’m a big fan of Rihanna’s product line.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,25 Jan 2025,loreleikitiara,This mascara was good it is super black and makes your eyelashes look really long and full the only problem I had with it was it smudging if I put it on my lower lash line so I just put it on the upper lash line,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,25 Jan 2025,BreonnaM,"PERFECTTTTT, gives lashes the best volume that no mascot could ever give. Not runny at all either",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Does the job very well!,23 Jan 2025,SCLuv,Lengthens and thickens.  I’d buy it again. Doesn’t clump but you need a good remover to get rid of it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella thicc,23 Jan 2025,StefsOpinion,"Cute and simple packaging. Priced well for a known brand, won't break the bank. Works pretty well, thickens and lengthens lashes nicely. Can be a little clumpy when applying, but if you have a spare clean brush, you can smooth the clumps out. Worth buying if you want hella thic lashes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,23 Jan 2025,itsmetima,It does the job and is a decent mascara. The better than sex by too faced I find is less dense and tends to keep the lashes curled higher for longer than this one.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
best mascara,23 Jan 2025,eastbrunswick,best lash product I have ever used and love my lashes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,22 Jan 2025,lypham,"Like the size of the brush. Easily coated my lashes in a few swipes without getting all over my eyelids. The formula is very lengthening and volumizing. However, it did bleed on me towards the end of the day.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,22 Jan 2025,cassietayler,"This is one of my new mascaras! I had been on the hunt for a new one and am a fan of this brand so I was very excited to try it out!

definitely worth buying,21 Jan 2025,itsmelsephora,I got this mascara to try it out and its the best one i own so far it has a lot of product. definitely recommend getting for a gift or for your own. Love itt!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Beautiful mascara,19 Jan 2025,jazzrae23,"I love this mascara it makes my lashes long and really thick without clumping together. My lashes look long and healthy,It’s easy to use and doesn’t get everywhere like a lot of other mascaras. Doesn’t have a smell that’s awful or strong and It last all day without flaking. The packaging is useful as it’s a flat surface rather than round and it’s easier to store. This will be my go to for now on.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must have,19 Jan 2025,KW04683,"I love how smooth this goes on. Looks great, easy to hold, and maneuver. Really makes your lashes pop. The packaging is eye-catching. I would recommend this product .",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing!,18 Jan 2025,Val3231,I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is the first product that I have ever tried from Fenty. As someone who has very straight lashes it is so hard to find a good mascara. This works super well with my lashes I usually curl them with my shiseido eyelash curler then go in with the first coat let it dry curl again and so on with a second coat and omg it does wonders. It makes my eyelashes super nice and voluminous. I love that you can add several coats and it does no clump. This product definitely makes me want to try out more fenty products! So far I am impressed and this is only one product from the line. Can’t wait to try more!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not my favorite,18 Jan 2025,Aubz91,I do like the formula of this mascara but it’s definitely not my favorite by far.  For the price point I expected much more.  I feel like the brush was too big for me and also it smudged quickly.  That being said it did enhance my lash length and volume.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not my favorite mascara,18 Jan 2025,JulyPI,"This’s quite a decent mascara, it definitely gives volume and length, I usually curl my eyelashes before and it didn’t weigh them down. It feels on a drier side for me, and I had some fall outs. I used to have Fenty FULL FRONTAL VOLUME, LIFT & CURL MASCARA, and this one I really loved. It was perfect for me, especially how it curled up my lashes.
The Hella Thick isn’t impressive for me, I wouldn’t buy it for myself.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good but smears if wearing all night,15 Jan 2025,Snemery,"I’ve wanted to try the Fenty brand for awhile so I was really excited about this mascara. Putting it on was nice, smooth not clumpy. Length added was pretty good. I took a picture with one eye done and one not for comparison. It lasted all day and didn’t flake. Only down fall, I don’t always wash my make up off at night, and this mascara smears pretty bad! Not the worst I’ve used, but definitely worst than my regular go-to mascara. I had to use a makeup wipe first thing in the morning where I normally wait and wash my face after coffee. It was also on my pillowcase, which again, isn’t normal for me. If you wash before bed, no problem and good go to!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Worst mascara,14 Jan 2025,Sofi567,"When I came to the shop , the helper convinced me that I wouldn’t look like a panda after using it , but I did  so totally not recommending",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Gives volume.,14 Jan 2025,,Brush is thick and fluffy gives volume and length.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,14 Jan 2025,knk0311,This mascara really breathes life into my eyelashes! They’re so long and thick. They’re gorgeous. I love the applicator and the packaging is super cute. I would definitely buy more of this. I received this for free from Influenster and the opinions are my own.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A fantastic mascara!,12 Jan 2025,AnnHannah,"Fantastic mascara, from someone who is very picky! I seldom find mascaras that I feel work with my eyelashes and don’t get clumpy or look like spider legs. I like a thin but elongating coat and this is perfect for that! I prefer a different applicator usually but this works very well!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Fab Fenty,12 Jan 2025,egonza78,"This is probably the best mascara I’ve ever had. It adds volume, thickens, and makes my lashes longer. Loved the black tint and easy application. Packaging was clean and easy to read. I love it!! Definitely worth the price and a great product. I would recommend it.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara!,12 Jan 2025,vmnguyen07,Mascara glided on effortlessly. Was able to apply layers without it looking clumpy or flakey. It didn’t smear when I wore it all day for work. Packaging makes it look fancy for the price. Would recommend this product to try!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
The best ever,12 Jan 2025,Aaliyaharriott,This mascara is so good! It left my lashes looking full and the volume is crazy! Absolutely understand the hype. The formula is a perfect combination of not being to dry or wet which is typically what I go for in mascaras!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Volume & thickness for hours,11 Jan 2025,lovue,"I am in love! From the packaging to the product,  everything is so well thought out. It has the applicator wand has the bristles in all the correct places to give you lashes with volume. I have very things flat lashes, and this has completely changed the eyelash game for me. Usually, I will have watery eyes with some eye lash products, but with this one, I don't have to worry about that at all. Highly recommend 10/10 I received this a a review",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great product,11 Jan 2025,TracyEmily1o1,I received this product for free and I am an absolute love it stays on so well throughout the day and applies very easy and is a great value,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love the Lashes!!,11 Jan 2025,SNH31,"I love the bold, black shade of this mascara! I also really like the shape of this wand. It's easy-to-apply to lashes, with minimal tugging and pulling. Clumping was minimal, but I did comb through my lashes with a separator, after applying several coats of this mascara. Overall, I do recommend Fenty's Hella Thicc Mascara, and I will continue to use it!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Pretty good,10 Jan 2025,FosterMom1,"The Hella Thic Volumizing Mascara is an 8/10. It loses points because I don’t feel as though it thickened my lashes at all. It lengthened and curled, but there were a good bit of flakes on my face by 10am.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love,10 Jan 2025,BoyMomx84,"Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara is a top-notch product that delivers a transformation. The applicator makes it easy to apply and reach all lashes giving a fuller look. I prefer a black shade mascara and love the deep rich black that it provides. This mascara is waterproof and doesn’t flake or smudge. I highly recommend the Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara to anyone looking for a reliable, volumizing, lengthening mascara that will stay put!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Love it,10 Jan 2025,JennaLady,"Fenty beauty has come with some beautiful products, and this adds to the collection. Hella thic mascara is black. Definitely gives you a curl and lengthen them.It smells like glue to me but doesn't have a scent. This is reasonable priced and I will buy it again.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Gives volume but smudges,09 Jan 2025,MoonPetal21,"This mascara was able to give my pin straight Asian lashes some volume and was able to retain the curl. I was only able to use 1 coat before it became too clumpy. This mascara does transfer to your upper lids and does not dry down very quickly. For those of you that prefer a dryer mascara, this is not for you. It is a very wet formula. It does tend to smudge throughout the day/night and is not long wearing. But, it does remove easily with little effort. I was given this product free for testing and review.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Nice shade of black,09 Jan 2025,greeneyes1988,I received the fenty beauty by Rihanna fenty hella thicc mascara and it did not disappoint. I love a dark black mascara. It applied well and is a great deal. I would recommend!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Easy application,09 Jan 2025,5NaturalBeauty,This Fenty Hella Thick Mascara is easy to apply and goes on evenly due to the applicator. It has become my favorite mascara because you can add multiple layers without it clumping. I use it in my natural lashes so I use two applications. When I wear it in falsies I only use one layer. The price is comparable to other designer mascaras and provide better benefits. I recommend others to try.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara,09 Jan 2025,124makeuplover,I love this mascara. It was very great. There was no cent. It’s a little expensive but the application goes on smooth not clumpy and overall pretty good.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
NO CLUMPING!,09 Jan 2025,MateosMama2020,Fenty Beauty does it again with another fabulous product. The packaging is super cute like always with all of Rihanna’s products.  The mascara doesn’t clump so it’s a perfect everyday mascara.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
i love it,09 Jan 2025,AabiJimru,"I have long eyelashes but without a curl and this mascara is one of the best I have tried since it does not lower the curl, separates them very well and does not leave clumps.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Okayyyyy lashes!,08 Jan 2025,deej223,Okay RiRi! I usually don’t have eyelashes that are visible and wow! They look huge! It smelled nice and didn’t have any clumping. The box was cute and it was very easy to apply I am a fenty girl now 🖤,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Nice Mascara,08 Jan 2025,LilBit72,"The mascara is nice, even with just 1 coat. I'm typically a 2 coat girl, so it's even better with more than 1, and my lashes are fuller. The wand is the type I like to use, which is perfect for me!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Nice mascara,08 Jan 2025,johnnaspringer,This mascara made my tiny lashes actually pop! I was pretty impressed. The packaging is also fancy and the tube. The product is easy to apply also.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,08 Jan 2025,xena18,Added a lot of volume and length to my lashes as well as made them very dark and stand out. One of the best mascaras I have ever tried. Blows every other out of the water,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Unfortunately, no",08 Jan 2025,LaLaChanel,"This product is so clumpy, it makes it impossible to work with. It would be amazing if didn’t cause the clumps. I’ve tried using one even coat but it doesn’t matter, it’s really bad. It also smudges everywhere.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good enough,08 Jan 2025,lexluth0r72828,"This is a perfectly decent mascara. It’s not the best, but it does the job. It adds length and volume although there is a little bit of clumping. I would never pay full price as there is nothing spectacular about it.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,08 Jan 2025,Lyoka,"I like the packaging. It's convenient to use.
Light pleasant scent. But wasn't crazy about the mascara itself. It dries quite slow and smudges. It feels like it's been already dried up and too thick. Doesn't coat evenly and nicely the lashes. Clumps. Crumbles after time.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great formula and long wearing,08 Jan 2025,CHicks88,The packaging is a simple and sleek though not particularly heavy. A plus is that of laid down it will also not roll away. The formula seems to wear nicely and doesn’t flake when doing touching ups throughout the day. This formula wasn’t waterproof and came off when using my oils cleanser without an issue. It didn’t have a scent which was also a plus. I would recommend this but would have enjoyed it more as a waterproof mascara .,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good Mascara,08 Jan 2025,JennT1123,I love the shape of the bottle. It’s super trendy and cute. I like that the mascara doesn’t leave clumps like a lot of them do. It applies on smoothly. I don’t think I would go out of my way to buy it because it doesn’t give me that lift that I would like without curling my lashes. Overall it’s a good mascara.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Will be considering making this a staple,6 Jan 2025,sbumbarger,"After the first use I wasn’t too sure, but I’m glad I have it a second chance. This mascara gave me full long lashes and was extremely comparable to what I was using previously. Price was reasonable too. I would continue to use this product.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great volume And length,6 Jan 2025,twinningmom,The mascara definitely goes on really nicely and makes my lashes look great. I got a ton of compliments on my lashes. I do already have pretty long eyelashes though. It stayed on nicely throughout the day and did not have a lot of fallout. My only problem with it is the difficulty of getting it off. It seems to smear around a bit.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara,6 Jan 2025,msNancyS,This is a great black mascara. It gives volume and length to your lashes. The packaging is beautiful. It can give raccoon eyes if you don’t slightly powder under your eyes if you wear glasses.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Perfect mascara,6 Jan 2025,sannshark,"I received the fenty beauty mascara Hella Thicc  in color ""cuz I'm black "" to try for free from @influenster and @fentybeauty in exchange for my honest review.

Nice product,6 Jan 2025,arianaefc,There isn’t any scent atleast to me. The application was smooth. A little of product goes a long way. It lengthen my lashes quite a bit. The wand is perfect.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Pretty good,5 Jan 2025,Sambaiz,Liked this mascara. Smells just like regular mascara would smell like. Wasn’t really the biggest fan of how clumpy it made my lashes look. It did go on pretty thick. I think you get a great amount for the price you pay for it. Packaging was simple and easy to follow.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My only Mascara!!,5 Jan 2025,Paigeayye,"This is my new favorite mascara. It is dark and glides on lashes effortlessly without causing clumps. I love the wand and how it grabs every lash. I was unsure how I would feel about the bottle/wand but it is wonderful! The geometric design is easy and comfortable to hold. I love how my lashes look full and long with only one pass. Generally my eyelashes do not stay curly however this mascara works wonders to keep my lashes curled, voluminous and dark!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"My new favorite,",5 Jan 2025,wonkybonkers,"Well this is definitely my new favorite mascara! The length it gives my lashes is fantastic! I like to try different mascaras, but don't try as many higher end brands, but I'm sold on this one. The little extra cost is worth how happy I am with how this works. The packaging is cute, but that doesn't matter to me if it works great. Not really any scent, typical mascara smell if you really give it a sniff 
I was given this mascara for free to give an honest review, and I honestly love it",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great Anna non clumping,5 Jan 2025,Yankowitz,Fenty Beauty by Rhianna Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara is a great new mascara that delivers volume and length. I am pleased with the results.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Voluminous!,5 Jan 2025,EinLouise,"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. And frankly, I enjoy this product! The packaging is comfortable to hold. The mascara is very volumizing and makes my lashes very dark and very thick. My biggest issue with it is that it is just volumizing. If I want my eyelashes lengthened, I have to use a different mascara to really lengthen and separate the lashes. I was walking in the rain and I had minimal running, but when washing my face it was easy to remove the mascara. I would recommend this product for volume and longevity.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Hella Thick, Hella Beautiful.",5 Jan 2025,MissessP,"Fenty, Hella Thick Volume Mascara. Hello, thick and beautiful lashes!

Mascara,5 Jan 2025,barms87,These mascara is pretty good. At first I didn’t like it much because it was very wet but after the 4 or 5 use it dried a little was worked amazing. I’ve not experienced any smudging and it comes off fairly easy.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
fenty mascara,5 Jan 2025,Emily9763,Mascara is my favorite makeup product. It can change your look with such little effort.  This Fenty mascara is black in color and applies smoothly to the lashes.

Another Nice Mascara,5 Jan 2025,AshBash4,"Another mascara that is nice, but not necessarily amazing.  It’s a nice packaging, there’s not a scent which is great.

One thing I don’t love is how light it applies, but it’s great for a more natural look if that’s what I’m going for.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not For Fine Lashes,5 Jan 2025,lilgurlgsr,"Nice packaging and liked the wand, however the formula wasn’t for me. It was a little too thick that didn’t apply nicely with my finer lashes. My curl fell almost instantly after it was applied. Sadly this wasn’t for me!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Bold lashes that last!,5 Jan 2025,Jaybae3,"I received the Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara for free to review, and I absolutely love it! It gives my lashes that bold, dramatic look I adore. I especially love wearing this when I go out—it makes my eyes pop without having to use falsies. The formula builds volume effortlessly without clumping, and it stayed put without smudging. Not to mention, the tube and wand are really nice too. Whether it’s a night on the town or just wanting to feel extra glam during the day, this mascara is my go-to. It’s everything I could ask for in a mascara and more!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
not a favorite,4 Jan 2025,rosinka,"It's not a favorite, smells a little bad , and makes my lashes very sticky together. I don't like this i like volume, and they stay separate. The packing is cute, and the color is. good but not for me the product is not .",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,4 Jan 2025,rosyrose2,"My lashes are naturally long, but do not have much curl/lift. I was hoping this would be the answer for adding a nice lift. After applying two coats, I didn't notice any lift/curl from the mascara. It did create more volume. However, I found that it did smudge slightly after a few hours of normal day activities. It created the dreaded raccoon eyes and had some dry flaking.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Meh…,4 Jan 2025,misscherryspoon,"I loved the heft of the packaging/wand.  You can grip it well.  The color was rich and velvety black.  Applying is as easy as any mascara.  

The formula is quite thick which I like.  It didn’t clump during application.  It gave my non-existent lashes a good bit of volume and some length.  However, it smeared horribly and during my daily wear, it did flake a bit.  It’s a decent enough mascara, just not the best.  
*Received free for my honest review.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Doesn’t hold a curl and transfers like crazy!,4 Jan 2025,Maddslanctot,"I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I am so bummed out by this mascara. I love Fenty Beauty and I was so excited to try this. I have used this one time and will most likely not be using it again. 

Pros of this mascara: 
I loved the simple packaging and how when you set the mascara down- you can set it however (standing up or on its side). It has beveled edges to stay put instead of being completely  circular like other mascaras. 

This mascara is VERY black in color. The shade it came in is called “cuz I’m black”. It is noticeably blacker than a lot of my other mascaras that are in the blackest shade available. 

This did a great job at lengthening my lashes and giving them tons of volume. No complaints there.

This mascara has a bit of a flowery scent to it. I didn’t hate it but it wasn’t that noticeable. 

Cons: 
The formula is so creamy that it doesn’t hold a curl. It’s has no hold to it. I have incredibly straight eyelashes and need a mascara that hold curl and this is most definitely not that. 

I have combination skin and dryer/normal under eyes and this transferred like CRAZY under my eyes. It made me look like a raccoon within about 2 hours.

I thought this mascara dyed my lashes very very black which isn’t a complaint. But turns out it’s just because it’s incredibly hard to get off all the way and lingers for days if you don’t scrub it off. I typically don’t have to “scrub off” my mascara in order to get it all off. Every time I thought I got it all off- I had to think again because it wouldn’t come off of my lashes. I think this is due to how incredibly creamy and pigmented this mascara is. 


Overall this mascara is not for me. I do not recommend it due to the reasons above. However, it did a great job at giving my lashes  volume, length and darkening.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Minimal Thickness,4 Jan 2025,emilyc4513,"I had high hopes for the Hella Thick Volumizing Mascara by Fenty Beauty, but it didn’t quite deliver the results I was looking for. While my lashes did look a bit longer, I didn’t get the thickness I expected. They ended up looking more separated and thin, which isn’t my usual preference. I also think the wand might not be the best choice for achieving full thickness—it didn’t seem to pick up or distribute enough product to build volume. If you prefer a more natural, lengthened look, this could work, but it’s not the dramatic effect I usually go for.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good mascara,4 Jan 2025,Sweetpea047,"This Fenty Volumizing Mascara glides on smoothly. The photos show no mascara, one coat, and two coats. I like the shape of the tube and the application, but I did expect more volume. Removing the mascara takes a little more low grease than my usual brand as well. Overall, I would recommend.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new fav,4 Jan 2025,LusciousLisa04,I received this product for free for testing purposes. Omg I’ve never tried fenty beauty mascara and I’ve missed out! Packaging is beautiful and it lasts all day long. The color I received was “cuz I’m black” and it’s very black which I appreciate. Easy to apply and what a big difference after I apply. I definitely recommend!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara,4 Jan 2025,KimTheirMom,"Absolutely one of my very, very favorite mascaras of all time I purchased and gift this to all of my friends. It’s definitely in my top two very favorites. I love everything from this line. The quality is insane. This particularly has a great brush for application. That is very effective, and it has a great price comparatively some of the other brands ",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great coverage,4 Jan 2025,Jen516,"This mascara coats lases with ease, lengthening and thickening lashes with only a coat or two. My sensitive eyes did get itchy after a few hours, though, so I likely won't purchase.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Want be buying again,4 Jan 2025,Crstel82,"After using this mascara for a couple weeks now, it is just ok to me. The mascara is very thick so when it goes on it can clump up really fast I had to keep going over it wiping the brush out to clean it to get my lashes to look the way that I wanted them to. Another issue I found with the mascara was would leave me wiping under my eyes constantly removing the mascara residue, I wish it would have dried but it seemed to have stayed wet for some reason. It came off super easy when I was removing my makeup which is a plus. Haha I was super excited about this mascara but I",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Just Okay,4 Jan 2025,ACarter0915,"This mascara is just okay. The tube is super cute and chic. The brush is on the smaller side which I like to get into the inner corners with. However it just doesn’t do much. It’s not very lengthening nor thickening. It doesn’t build well, as it dries down too fast to add another coat. On the positive side it is very black and doesn’t flake or anything. I reach for it on my lesser makeup days but for it to claim to be thickening, I didn’t have that experience.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Lashes look thicker and fuller,4 Jan 2025,gloria386,This is some awesome mascara. Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara has become my go-to brand. I love how it coats my lashes. My lashes look thicker and fuller & last looking good throughout the day. The mascara does not flake or smudge. I love it and highly recommend it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Soft and sexy,3 Jan 2025,Porko,"The package was simple , the mascara itself is easy to hold. The brush is soft, simple and glides smooth on my lashes. No heavy clumps which is a huge plus. Leaves my eyelashes feeling wispy, fresh and sexy.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
New favorite mascara!,3 Jan 2025,AmandaBledsoe,"First of all, the brush is fantastic. Its design allows for even application without clumping, making each lash stand out. The formula is just the right consistency—not too wet and not too dry—ensuring that it glides on smoothly and stays put all day. 

What's impressive is how buildable this mascara is. With just one coat, you get a natural, voluminous look perfect for everyday wear. Add a second or third coat, and you achieve that dramatic, hella thick lash effect ideal for a night out. Plus, it doesn't flake or smudge, even after hours of wear.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A must have for any makeup bag,3 Jan 2025,3rjr,"I love using this product as it gives long, thick looking lashes, lasted all day and didn’t clump or flake. Applying it was took no effort and my lashes looked like I was wearing fake lashes. It looks really pretty and gives such nice volume. I really love it!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Amazingly effective, love!",3 Jan 2025,mrslos04,"This mascara is absolutely the best one I’ve ever used! I thought others were great but this one blew them away. 
**I received this product in exchange for my honest review**
You can see with the pic posted just how well it coats the lash and makes your eyes pop! It’s easy to apply, no clumping on the lashes. I’ve found it stays put way better than other products I’ve used. The price is amazing for the quality, I’ll certainly be buying again when this one runs out. The brush applies the product evenly, for me one application is all that’s needed. I do think using an eyelash curler first would really look great. No irritation and easy to remove at the end of the day.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Best of both worlds,3 Jan 2025,sarahm5,Just got this mascara for the first time did my full face of makeup. It looks really good and applied well. I cried probably 30 minutes after I put it on and it didn’t even roll down my face. Obviously had to redo my full face ofmakeup and when I was taking it off it came off so easy,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Raccoon eyes within a few hours,3 Jan 2025,ladyinredbites,"I wanted to like this mascara. I tried under several varying conditions and all of them ended in dark bags under my eyes and smudging.

I don’t wear mascara on my bottom lashes and have very long upper lashes.  After a few hours of wearing this mascara I had dark smudges in the tear trough area.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love this!,3 Jan 2025,elenamo,Love this mascara! Gave me volume and length! The packaging is sleek and glides on nice on the lashes! No crazy smell either! Would purchase in future!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Free for review,3 Jan 2025,Bealbeauty,"I received this free for review. This claims to be big, bold, thick, voluminous. It claims to be Sweat-, humidity-, & transfer-resistant. I find it lasts through a 12 hour work day. It has minimal curl and lift.
It has a standard bristle brush. I find it clumps less than my drugstore mascara. It does look bold and more dramatic than my drugstore mascara. It comes in a lightweight package. It didn't feel too heavy in my hands, which some might not like the light plastic. It is water resistant, but but water proof. It will smudge in water. Overall, a decent mascara.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,3 Jan 2025,Desmest,"I received this product free for testing. This products packaging is cute and application is easy enough, but it is a little wet so it can be messy. It also has a lot of fall out throughout the day. This seems like a cheaper value, but it does its job if you can deal with that. In the photos was when I first applied it and the last one is at the end of the day, the lighting is darker but you can see the fallout.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good,2 Jan 2025,purple620,"The package was super cool love black. It really didn't have a scent, I noticed. Easy to apply like the brush. Great value for the price. It was very thick on lash. Love i was given chance to review",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara,2 Jan 2025,edenbridge15,It’s a great mascara. Nice packaging and not a lot of flaking. It’s a great mascara. Nice packaging and not a lot of flaking. It’s a great mascara. Nice packaging and not a lot of flaking.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Pretty good,2 Jan 2025,DestinyLynn97,It's a pretty good mascara and I use it in my regular rotation. My only complaint is that it's a little bit dry so it does clump up and flake a little bit but it's still good. I'd recommend trying it if you're on the fence,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Cute!,2 Jan 2025,victoria1123xox,I really like this Fenty beauty mascara. The packaging is adorable and I love the tube. I think it applies really nicely and it has soft bristles. If that is something you seek out.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara!,2 Jan 2025,RonaG,"Cute packaging. No obvious scent. Smooth application, no clumps. Black color that looks pretty for a great value. Lengthens lashes. Highly recommend.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing fullness!,2 Jan 2025,CMTafur,"Fenty Beauty by Rihanna mascara is AWESOME!  The formula is rich and ultra-black, providing intense length and volume in just a few strokes. It doesn't clump or flake, making it perfect for all-day wear. The brush design is perfect, snatching even the tiniest lashes for a full, fanned-out effect. Whether you’re aiming for a subtle daytime look or bold, sultry eyes, this mascara delivers. Plus, the sleek packaging adds a touch of luxury to your makeup bag. Overall, it’s a must-have for anyone who loves defined, impactful lashes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Really made my lashes pop!,2 Jan 2025,jagruti6,"This came well packaged and looks so cute. The marasca applies easily and really gave great definition to my lashes. It smells pleasant and I did not need to apply a lot to get the desired effect, which is great because it means that it will last for a long time.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Fluffy,2 Jan 2025,KittenswithPupp,"I really like this mascara. I have short, straight lashes and I didn't find this more volumizing than any other mascara. However, I did find that it makes my lashes extremely fluttery and curled and it lasts all day. It's a drier formula with a narrower brush, which makes it very easy to get the mascara all the way down to my lash roots and keep all my lashes separated. I don't believe this is waterproof, but I haven't noticed any smudging and it comes off easily and cleanly with cleansing balm. And a tiny detail, but the tube is a sort of prism, which is great because it doesn't roll away. 

My only con is that it does tend to leave little uneven clumps and bits. A quick pass over with the wand will remove/cover them, but it does take some extra care and patience.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new favorite mascara,1 Jan 2025,jxharis,"Fenty Beauty’s Hella Thicc Mascara is a game-changer for anyone craving bold, voluminous lashes! The creamy, non-clumping formula glides on effortlessly, coating every lash from root to tip for a full-fan effect. I love how it adds dramatic volume without feeling heavy, making it perfect for both everyday wear and glam looks. The hourglass-shaped brush grabs every lash, even those tiny inner corners, for a lifted, eye-opening finish. Plus, it lasts all day without smudging or flaking. If you’re looking for a mascara that delivers big, bold results, this is it! Highly recommend.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Fluffy applicator maker lashes thick.. transfers,1 Jan 2025,MarieDon,I received this product free for review.  It has a very fluffy applicator which I didn’t love.  It did make my lashes appear thicker however I had transfer unit my eyes after only a few hours of wear.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,1 Jan 2025,iaredeema,Loved this mascara! Gives great volume with just a few strokes. May clump a little and give you spider lashes if applied too much but overall great volume if done just right.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Lots of volume but heavy,1 Jan 2025,MakaylaKimtae,"This is an okay mascara. Going on there’s pretty much no clumping and the lashes look pretty thicc and lifted. But after about 20 minutes the curl had fallen. Overall this mascara has a very wet formula and could weigh down lashes. As for the wear test, at the end of the day it had flaked A LOT.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Very smart,1 Jan 2025,cam5home,"At first I was confused by the shape, but honestly after using it and not having it roll off the counter I’m forever grateful for our girl for thinking through everything. Honestly it’s a good formula too. It looks good and lasted all day so I’m happy.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,1 Jan 2025,ndb15,I felt like the mascara is pretty average. I was really excited to try the product since I’ve tried other Fenty products and have loved them. The mascara left clumps.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Doesn’t reflect the name,1 Jan 2025,fabdarlin,This mascara is called Hella Thick and unfortunately it doesn’t feel hella thick at all when you look at the lashes. The lashes look a little bit more than natural but not dramatically thick at all. That being said it’s not a bad mascara and I would still use it. I think the packaging is very unique and cool. The brush is fine I had no issues with it. Overall I just think that if you are gonna claim this as hella thick it needs to live up to that.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s alright,1 Jan 2025,MIMIf1991,"I liked this mascara but found it super difficult to remove - even with makeup remover I had a line of darkness under my eyes. I have pretty delicate lashes so I noticed I didn’t reach for the mascara as often as some of my other favorites. That said, it’s definitely lengthening and gives a sort of clumpy look that’s in style these days.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My favorite mascara!!!,31 Dec 2024,Tricascorner,"This mascara really surprised me. Packaging was standard but the product itself was not your run of the mill bottle shape. The wand allows great application and definition, so that each lash is coated. It has a  no clump formula. Hands down my favorite this year!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
perfect thick lashes but smudges & flakes,31 Dec 2024,EllenT47,"Ad, This was gifted from influenster! I wanted to love this. The formula is the perfect balance of wet & dry. It is exactly what it says: hella thicc, and I love that for my thin lashes. I did not have to build more than one coat to get the look I was going for! Unfortunately, on my lower lashes, it smudged and flaked really bad after only an hour of wear and it got worse when I would wear it all day long. That is a deal breaker for me :/",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Rihanna has done it again.,30 Dec 2024,Saydanibruh,"This mascara is so incredible! I received it as a sample, and I’m hooked. I’ll be using it regularly. It only takes a single layer, and you’re done in about 60 seconds.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Thick and long lashes all day long!,30 Dec 2024,gabrielle0501,"This mascara is amazing. It holds a curl all day, doesn’t clump, has flawless application, doesn’t transfer, and doesn’t have any fallout.  I love how it stays all day long but is easy to remove! The packaging is cute and there’s no overwhelming scent. Will definitely buy in the future! (This product was gifted in exchange for a honest review)",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new favorite mascara!!,30 Dec 2024,tcshort,"Love, this mascara!! From the packaging to the long lasting affect!! I have used so many mascaras, cheap and expensive and the gently beauty by far is the best mascara I ever used! You only have to use 1 coat and the results are amazing!! They give you volume and fullness!! There really is no negatives!! It's amazing.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Long lashes with all day wear,30 Dec 2024,AlexReviews,"This mascara did a great job lengthening my lashes and separating them. No issues with clumping or having the product be too goopy. It wore really nicely throughout the day and didn’t seem to smudge when I rubbed my eyes. Washing it off was fairly easy but there was some residue stuck in my lash line that made it difficult to remove 100% of the product. Overall, I would recommend to someone who is looking for a defining mascara that wants all day wear without using a waterproof product.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Voluminous lashes,30 Dec 2024,madi947,Love this mascara. It lasts all day and is easy to apply and remove. My lashes look so long and voluminous. I will definitely be using this mascara going forward.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Easy to grip will buy again,30 Dec 2024,mimija09,Packaging is nice and easy to grip with the shape. The application is easy with the wand shape but it can come out slightly clumpy if you don’t let it fully dry between coats,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Loved it, would recommend",30 Dec 2024,Vargas1720,"First of all I loved the packaging. Such a slick and nice look. I loved that the mascara was not clumpy at the moment of taking it out of the tube. I wore it during Christmas Eve and we laughed, danced and the mascara made it through. Would recommend!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Lots of Volume,30 Dec 2024,bellaboops,"Love the packaging. Very sleek. The wand is like most other wands but works great. I  love the way my eyelashes get a lot of lift. I usually wear waterproof mascara, but this held up almost just as good. I recieved this product for free in exchange for my honest review",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing!,30 Dec 2024,Vinitha,"Amazing mascara! Well priced, clump free with an effective applicator. It lasted all day without smudging. Easy to travel with and gave my eyes an instant lift!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Mascara,29 Dec 2024,Cashale,I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This mascara is easy to apply to my lashes. Its a product that last all day or night!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,29 Dec 2024,yinlaura,It’s a perfect black! My eyelashes were left with a lot of volume even though I have few and downwards it kept the curve that I did before and after with the eyelash curler. And it is not transferred!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Decent,29 Dec 2024,cdbrenneman,"This a decent mascara. Was it mind blowing? No, but it does a good job. I love the component, the wand isn't my favorite. I usually prefer slightly larger bristles. I haven't noticed any flaking or transferring, which is nice for a non-waterproof mascara. It did become slightly clumpy sometimes, but that was user error. Overall, I like it.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
AMAZING,29 Dec 2024,LittleBabyBruce,"This mascara is EVERYTHING! It doesn’t flake, doesn’t smudge, is a great shade of black, and lasted through my 12 hour workday without missing a beat. My lashes are VOLUMIZED and so long! I will never buy another mascara again. I can’t believe how great of a job this",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Thicc & Vuluptuous,29 Dec 2024,jhkamin,"The mascara delivers in terms of volume and thickness. It builds nicely when layered, however it is a little on the clumpy side when too many coats are added. That was the only factor that I disliked about this mascara.
I received this product for free in exchange for my review.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,29 Dec 2024,Mishama,"I love the packaging, it’s sleek and black. I’m not a huge fan of the kind of brush it has but overall it worked well and my lashes looked great.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not having this again,29 Dec 2024,Maethe,After using this product for about a week I came to the conclusion that is not a good product. When you apply it looks really good but after a couple hours the mascara starts smearing and letting my eyes all with a dark shade under. Hard to remove as well. Weird. Not good quality.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Long, thick looking lashes",29 Dec 2024,sweetartlette,"Fenty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara is a very nice mascara. Long, thick looking lashes in one easy step in a pretty package. Definitely recommend.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good volume but can look clumpy,28 Dec 2024,olgakov,"This mascara does give a beautiful, dramatic volume to eyelashes even with one coat. The faceted packaging looks cool and the wand is pretty convenient to apply. It has no noticeable scent and I also like that it is easy to wash off
However, it has drawbacks too:
🔻I have to be very careful applying it, because it can easily start looking clumpy - I like when lashes look more separated and neat
🔻sometimes I get smudging under eyes by the end of the day",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not Happy,28 Dec 2024,yarrr,"I did not like the mascara. It has a smell to it. It has a chemical/alcohol smell. It does make your lashes long and thick. When I applied it, it gave my lashes length and the thickness came from how clumpy it makes your lashes. I tried giving it a few passes but it got worse. I'm used to giving my lashes a few passes if they look clumpy and the wand removes the clumps. Not this mascara. The wand is pretty standard. Not worth it.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Nice mascara,28 Dec 2024,tnt2412,"This mascara really lengthened my lashes and looked great throughout the day. I applied two coats after curling my lashes and saw such a large difference in their appearance. However, this mascara smudged on me. I have combination/oily skin and within an hour, the mascara had transferred to the bottom of my lash line.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella thicc says it all!,28 Dec 2024,Elinapan,"I really like this mascara. I was skeptical at first because of the name, but after using for over a month I think it’s pretty nice. First of all, the packaging is amazing and it looks very luxurious. Because of the thickness of the formula, it coats your lashes quickly and you don’t need many coats which adds up to the value. If you do multiple coats, it might end up looking really clumpy. It lengthens your lashes and gives your eyes a dramatic look.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A great mascara,28 Dec 2024,Brandywine1977,"I received this mascara from Influenster and Fenty Beauty for my honest review. I typically don't like celebrity makeup brands because I feel you're paying for their name rather than quality. But, I am impressed with Fenty Beauty by Rhianna. It comes in a cute tube. I really like the brush. It's perfect! It thickens and lengthens the lashes. I have short and thin lashes and I am very pleased with the results. Not clumpy at all. It stays all day. Comes off cleanly. I would definitely buy this mascara and recommend it to others.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good,28 Dec 2024,gingersnap34,This mascara is pretty good but it seems to transfer really easily. Maybe that’s just me?,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love It,28 Dec 2024,maridastari,The mascara lasts all day and doesn’t flake off at all. I hate clumpy lashes and the brush allows me to separate them. This paired with a good eyelash curler will give you some nice lashes!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Very volumizing but smudges ,28 Dec 2024,glizzilizzi,"Amazing packaging, amazing applicator just the product itself is a little clumpy gets on my eyelids and under my eyes on my waterline throughout the day and it's very difficult to get off. Other than that, it does exactly what it says it does. My lashes are huge with this mascara ",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Possible bad batch?,27 Dec 2024,RachelFogletto,To be honest I feel like I got a dried out version of this or something because it was super clumpy and difficult to apply evenly from the first use- I’ve used Fenty products in the past and all were fantastic so I hope it’s just a fluke,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Thicc lashes with a black cast,27 Dec 2024,TiffanyArlene,"Gorgeous packaging, great applicator, and goes on easy. My only issue is that it smudges after a while and I noticed a slight raccoon eye effect and a light black dusting under my concealer. It did make my lashes look plump and thick, which they are naturally but the mascara made them pop.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,27 Dec 2024,Mnashville,"I had the chance to try Fenty Beauty’s Hella Thicc Mascara after receiving it for free, and it did not disappoint! The packaging is sleek and feels luxe, just like you’d expect from Fenty.

The formula is rich, super black, and definitely lives up to the “hella thicc” name. It instantly added dramatic volume and length to my lashes with just one coat. The wand’s shape is perfect for gripping every lash, even the tiny ones in the corners, without clumping.

One of my favorite features? It stayed put all day—no smudging, even after a long wear test. Yet, when it was time to remove it, it came off easily with micellar water.

If you’re looking for bold, statement lashes with minimal effort, I’d highly recommend giving this a try. It’s become a new staple in my makeup routine!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella thicccccc!!!,27 Dec 2024,cmackerbeauty,"Wow! I recently tried Fenty Beauty’s Hella Thicc Mascara and I am totally hooked! This mascara lives up to its name by giving my lashes an insane amount of volume. The formula is super rich and thick, but it doesn’t clump or feel heavy on my lashes. The brush is large and fluffy, which really helps coat each lash from root to tip, adding tons of fullness and drama.

What I love most is that it gives me that “false lash” look without needing falsies. My lashes look thick, full, and bold in just one coat, but it’s also buildable if you want even more impact. It holds the curl all day without flaking or smudging, which is such a relief for me since I have oily skin. The intense black color also really makes my eyes pop.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella THICC hella WIN,27 Dec 2024,chetmintar,"As always, fenty hits a home run. The packaging is mad sleek, very cool and feels right in your hands. It ain't lying when it says it's thick, might not add much for length but it gives you VOLUME. pair this with a lengthening mascara, and I don't doubt you could skip the falsies. Just for how long this is lasting me 3 weeks in, it's worth the price tag. My phone doesn't even take the best pictures but you can't deny that coverage. Incentivized",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Middle of the road mascara,27 Dec 2024,Algenista82,"I was excited to receive this product in exchange for honest feedback. I liked the overall packaging and the brush applicator was small enough to get all of my lashes. With that said, I found that the formula itself was clumpy and flaked on my lashes, I also found that I had to clean off any excess product prior to using because too much mascara was on the brush. Overall at high hopes for the mascara, and I did like how black the pigment was, the brush was able to get all of my lashes, but the formula is clumpy and again it flaked.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
amazing mascara !,27 Dec 2024,abbyrosalina,"i love this mascara so much !! it really makes my lashes pop, and it lasts all day !! i highly recommend this mascara to anyone looking for a good mascara !!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Fenty did it again!,27 Dec 2024,IlianaE,This mascara did not disappoint! It left my eyelashes looking fuller and more bold. I love it for a glam or natural look when you want an extra wow.

I love the volume this mascara gives my lashes.,27 Dec 2024,Acmflores,"I was one of the lucky ones chosen to receive this Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Fenty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara Cuz I’m Black in exchange for my honest review. The first thing I noticed is the tapered brush, it does a great job making sure the mascara goes evenly on every lash. The mascara went on nice and smooth with no lumps. I was surprised by how long and thick my lashes looked after applying the mascara. I was very impressed by the volume it gave my lashes. The mascara didn’t flake or smudge throughout the day which was awesome. Overall a great mascara. I will definitely be adding to my daily beauty routine. I also love the name of the Mascara, very unique. You definitely need to try it!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Will be buying again,27 Dec 2024,Haleighkaye,I was really excited that I got to try this product for free. It gave my lashes great length and volume without them clumping together. I didn’t need to use many coats to have a nice effect. It’s long lasting and doesn’t flake off. I highly recommend.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,26 Dec 2024,giggles438,I was excited to try this product. Loved the packaging and brush but did not like the formula. Little clumpy and would smear when smiling or laughing too much.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not my favorite,26 Dec 2024,KristinBaca,"I received the Fenty Hella Thicc mascara as a free sample in exchange for my honest review. It's a good mascara, but it's not my favorite. It doesn't give a lot of length. It gives a little bit of volume. It's more of a natural full look, but it can get a little clumpy if you try to build it up too much. I'm not into the chunky look. Not my favorite wand type either. The curl holds decent and it doesn't smudge on me. Easy to take off too. Overall not a go to for me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I would repurchase this!,26 Dec 2024,OhKayFlo,"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I really liked this, as some who strictly believes that drugstore mascara does the job, I might be convinced to switch to mid-tier. I really liked how well my lashes were defined, this formula is black-black when I usually do black-brown. It's a bit of a wetter formula than what I'm used to, but it applies very nicely and I liked the final look for it.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,26 Dec 2024,FoxyLady247,"This volumizing mascara is a game-changer! The formula is called 'Hella Thicc' for a reason, it glides on effortlessly, delivering intense volume and nice length with just a couple strokes.

"Very dark, thickening formula",25 Dec 2024,odd1,"I received this mascara in exchange for a review. It’s a great thickening formula. After only two coats, my very blonde eyelashes look almost false. The packaging is cute, and the diamond shaped tube is easy to handle. Would buy again,it reminds me of the old Bad Gal Lash formula but with a wand better suited for lower lashes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Pass on this one,24 Dec 2024,emmb4,"Well I do think this product makes the lashes look thicker and more volumized, I found that it transfers like crazy on my lower and upper lash line.

A great new option,24 Dec 2024,drc123,"I had gotten away from wearing mascara, but I had the opportunity to try this for free so I jumped at it. The formula isn't too thick and it doesn't clump.

Worth the money,23 Dec 2024,princessredness,"This mascara is pretty good, I have oily eye lids so most mascaras give my “panda eyes” but not this one. I wore it for 10 hours and it looked just as good as when I first applied it",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Lovely!,23 Dec 2024,aligrace1,"I  was thrilled to get to try this mascara as I am a fan of every Fenty beauty product, I’ve tried to date. Recently, I’ve been experiencing a lot of irritation in my eyes, so i was nervous as mascara often makes it worse, but this mascara didn’t at all and I am extremely sensitive. The only downside is there was some transfer to my eyelid throughout the night.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Nice sleek mascara,22 Dec 2024,MissB82,The packaging is nice. The shape of the tube is different and easier to hold. The shape of the wand is different than I've used before. I definitely recommend wiping the excess off before application and then building it to the coverage you want as you add layers. If you don't wipe off the excess you will get clumps. My lashes definitely look fuller. I love a good sleek mascara. I am not sure I would pay full price.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,22 Dec 2024,olga91,"This is a really good mascara. It adds so much volume to

Just average mascara,21 Dec 2024,remy84,"While it’s a nice mascara, I have others I actually prefer much more. The formula gets too clumpy on my lashes and I have to spend more time than I’d like combing them out. I did like that the formula isn’t too dry, so the product didn’t crumble off my lashes. But it was wet enough that it caused the clumping as well as being easy to smudge. Overall, I wouldn’t buy this one, I have ones that work better for less.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Highly recommended,21 Dec 2024,skynie28,Very effectively on the eye lashes. It is value for your money. Volume and last long. Help your eyes more bigger and look younger. The color is nice and suitable with my hair color too.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

"Good, not great",20 Dec 2024,jennyqt47,"I have short, straight Asian lashes.

So good!,19 Dec 2024,lilauggie4,"I was very impressed with this mascara!! It seems initially like it’s just another lengthening mascara that would likely flatten my lashes however that’s not the case! It gave plenty of fullness and length, and somehow managed to keep my lashes somewhat curled throughout the day! My lashes are usually straight about two hours into the day. I’d definitely recommend this!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A decent mascara,19 Dec 2024,Stephaccino,I like the packaging and color of the mascara itself. The wand works well and it's easy to apply to the lashes.

I appreciated that the mascara didn't flake off.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Formula is great wand is okay,18 Dec 2024,KatieMcMak7,"I really wanted to love this mascara. While I do like the formula. I don't love the spoolie/brush. It leaves the lashes a little too clumped together. When I used a different spoolie to spread it better it was nice but it does get a little spidery if I don't do it quick enough. It does seem to lengthen my lashes well and made them a little fuller looking. I normally take off my mascara with just water because my eyes can be sensitive to makeup remover but the mascara didn't come off easily and kind of just spread around, but it did come off with remover well.
I did receive this product complementary from Influenster for testing purposes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Bold and Buildable,15 Dec 2024,mzjujufinds,"I was so excited to get this from Influenster to try. I’m a big fan of Fenty beauty products and this one did not fail. It is very buildable, doesn’t flake and the boldness of the black is perfect.  This is not like a tube mascara so you will need make up remover when you take it off because I noticed when I tried to just wash my face regular it took some effort even though it’s not even waterproof so that was a great discovery. Overall great product.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Black and long lasting,15 Dec 2024,nasR05,"I have short, flat and light natural lashes.
This helped with some volume and dimension even without curlers. The pictures are without any eyelash curler.

Highly Recommend For Those In Search of a Go-To Ma,14 Dec 2024,boxodh,"I received the Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc mascara in the Shade ‘Cuz I’m Black’ for free, and here a couple things i loved about it; 1) the application wand is precise and allows me to reach every lash without clumping up up too much in the corner or outside edge and 2) the life of the product is impressive and it stays looking fresh throughout the day. My one critique is the product has been rubbing off on the top of my lids, but that has been more occasional than inevitable. Overall love this and recommend!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Stays on. For a really long time.,14 Dec 2024,theagave,"As far as “volumizing” goes, I’ve had better mascaras—this one runs pretty middle of the ground. That said, this mascara is VERY transfer-proof. It doesn’t flake off, I can’t cry it off, washing my face hardly does anything. If you want a long-lasting, impenetrable barrier of mascara on those lashes, Fenty might be your girl.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Okay mascara,14 Dec 2024,LKF723,"I got this for free for my honest review. The outside packaging was very on brand. The mascara component was small and made out of cheap plastic, I expected it to be a little more high end. It applied smoothly. I loved my initial results. My lashes were thicker and longer. It lasted through a major cry session. After a few hours it did become dry and start to flake.  I was happy to try it out , but this won’t be a repurchase.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Lasts all day,13 Dec 2024,Slavago2,Im surprised by the negative reviews cause I really loved this mascara. I’m usually indifferent about mascaras and go for the drugstore ones since I have never really found one I like but this changes things. I have oily lids and struggle with raccoon eyes and flaking with most brands of mascaras luxury and drugstore. This was after 6hr+ and no raccoon eyes. And also I like the wand. It’s nothing crazy but does have a more triangle shape so the tip is smaller and easier to get into the corners.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

It can not only make eyelashes thicker, but also make them longer and curlier, especially for my lower eyelashes. After using this mascara, my lower eyelashes become clear and obvious immediately.

✅It is also very easy to remove makeup. I use makeup remover to remove it very cleanly, and I don’t need to pull the eyelashes. I just press it gently, and the mascara will come off in a while. Just make sure to clean the lower eyelashes as well.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Super Thick Lashes!,13 Dec 2024,muffin33,"The Hella Thicc mascara by Fenty Beauty definitely made my lashes hella thick! All I needed  was  1 coat to achieve  desired  thickness,  2 coats made my lashes stick together.  The applicator itself is medium size, and effectivly holds enough product without having to re dip. The only issue I found was that it tended to be a bit clumpy, both on the end of applicator and on my lashes. Overall I enjoyed the final look. I would  recommend this mascara for anyone who wants very thick lashes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Fenty Mascara,13 Dec 2024,whymewhyme,This is a good mascara. I wish that it had a better fan effect like some other mascaras but it works pretty well overall. I also wish that it was easier to get the product out of the container on the brush.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Thickens my non-existent lashes,13 Dec 2024,ishmichele,"The mascara definitely does the job of thickening your lashes. My invisible lashes looked normal for once.

Creates Hella Thicc Lashes,13 Dec 2024,Brittanydimeler,"Product does exactly what it says, “hella thicc!” I did two applications on the top lashes and it definitely made my lashes look thicker and fuller. I think it even added a little length to them too. My only suggestion would be to not wear it on your bottom lashes. I did that and it bled onto my under eyes. Made me look a bit like I had 2 black eyes. 
I very much enjoyed this product and would consider buying again. The application was smooth, didn’t make my lashes look chunky/clumpy and stayed on all day.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

I rubbed my eyes several times during the day and it still looked great.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Poor Ingredients in Product,12 Dec 2024,MMamaw,"I am always concerned with ingredients in beauty products. This product is full of ingredients that are bad for your skin and cause cancer. (See pics) If you don't care about that, the coverage is decent, but it definitely feels kind of sticky on your lashes. It does provide a natural look versus and thick goopylook so I have it some stars for that.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I love it!,12 Dec 2024,gilmoregirl24,"The actual mascara tube is great. It is easy to hold and a bit of a unique design but still practical. It doesn’t have an overwhelming smell and doesn’t smell good or bad in a way that is noticeable. It really does make my lashes look very thick and I enjoy that but it almost makes them too long sometimes where it has been getting on my upper eyelid. It’s a great value and I am touching my eyes a lot and it doesn’t smudge very much which I enjoy. Overall, I really enjoy it and will be purchasing again",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Mascara is Gorgeous!,12 Dec 2024,cherrylips777,"Like it says in the name it makes my lashes hella thicc, it’s very voluminous and lengthening. Very beautiful and it makes natural lashes look like natural but better and gives a false lash look.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Beautiful Buildable Boldness!,11 Dec 2024,CherryPuff,"I received a complimentary product for testing purposes and I have really loved using this mascara over the past couple of weeks! 

The first test I did to try it out, was taking the application wand and seeing if I could get a good application with just a single dip.  I was able to get a decent every-day amount of mascara on both of my lashes using just a single wand of product! It’s also a very buildable mascara—I have 2 coats on in my review pictures and I think that’s the perfect amount of drama for some “Oomph” in your look without going over the top for the office or workplace. The formula also has a lot of staying power—I tried it out as a solo product and even without any setting spray or other products, there was minimal fallout or flaking by end of day.

I also liked the shape of the wand, the geometric body and top shape make holding onto the wand a lot easier than some more standard/circular product designs. Overall I’m stoked that I had chance to test this product out and looking forward to integrating it into my routine!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

,11 Dec 2024,JeCar17,"I received this product for free. I have fairly long lashes and typically use a volumizing drugstore mascara. I've read other reviews saying this mascara was clumpy. I didn't find it to be clumpy as long as I wiggled the brush from root to tip with every stroke. I found any clumps would disappear after that. As far as whether it added volume, I think my drugstore mascara did that better. This mascara provided more length than volume. The black is a very good black. There was minimal flaking after being on all day. I didn't experience any eye irritation and I have sensitive eyes. Overall, I still think there are drugstore mascaras that can provide the same effects. I don't think you need to spend this amount of money on a mascara.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Perfect for everyday use,11 Dec 2024,Normilkyway,"Fenty beauty mascara is a great product. It doesn't spread with just water, nor does it smudge. It's perfect for everyday use, which gives volume to the lashes 😍. Great value for the price and love the packaging.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Like but not Love,11 Dec 2024,randiemmans,I like but do not love this mascara! It certainly creates volume but it’s a bit clumpy and there’s a lot of fall out onto my skin throughout the day. I do like that it creates a dramatic look so would likely use for nights out!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Want thicc voluminous lashes?? Yes Please,11 Dec 2024,ctaylor5400,I have used the Fenty Hella Thicc mascara for over a week now and I enjoy it. It is a drier formula than I have used in the past but it coats the lashes very nicely without looking clumpy. I do recommend two coats to get the thick voluminous look. I like that it doesn't flake.

Great but not for me!,11 Dec 2024,Madi618,"I received this product for free to review. The packaging is great and Fenty has a great line of products! This mascara works really great! Unfortunately, my eyes are super sensitive with mascara, so it didn’t work out for me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s Thick!,11 Dec 2024,AngSal83,"I received this product as a free sample. I love how this mascara looks on me. It’s dark, thick and makes my eyelashes look amazing! It doesn’t wear well though. Throughout the day small flakes will drop on my under eyes leaving black streaks making me look crazy!!

I love this and will definitely be continuing to use it. Thank you fenty!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Very, Very Black Mascara is Just Okay",11 Dec 2024,AvaYoung14,"I found this mascara to be very, very black. However, I didn’t find it to be super helpful to my lashes because it was a little clumpy for me and seemed to weigh my lashes down, even with the first coat. I applied to coats as I normally would. You can see in my photos a before and after. I think the packaging is fun and a unique shape. I didn’t notice any scent when using the mascara, which is good. All and all, I wouldn’t go running to buy this, but I think it’s a fine black mascara.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Great product, thick and lush lashes",11 Dec 2024,ivfmommy,"What a great product.  Doesn't flake, leaves my lashes looking tick/full.  And removes completely when doing my skin care routine.  Thanks influenster for the opportunity to try this amazing product.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s Pretty Good…,11 Dec 2024,BlondeWisteria,"Although, I’m partial to saying it’s a great mascara to hold your lashes sky high, it did flake on me, which is a con of this mascara. Clumping wasn’t an issue, but I normally apply two coats, no more than two. Length and volume are both present.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,10 Dec 2024,Kynndallb,Love love love this mascara. When you layer it as ur final coat it really does enhance your lashes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Great every day mascara,10 Dec 2024,rachelk20,"I don’t typically go for a brush like this for my mascara, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it!

Thick and 🖤,10 Dec 2024,rdyk,"I had the opportunity to try Fenty Beauty’s Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara thanks to the Influenster app, and I am beyond impressed!

Packaging: The sleek design feels premium and is easy to handle. It’s compact and perfect for carrying on the go.
Application: The wand is amazing—it coats every lash evenly, giving a bold, voluminous look with minimal effort.
Effectiveness: My lashes looked fuller, thicker, and more defined after just one coat. It’s buildable without clumping, and the formula stays put all day without smudging.

Influenster made it so easy to discover and review this fantastic product. If you’re looking for dramatic lashes with a trustworthy mascara, Fenty Hella Thicc is a must-try!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing lashes,10 Dec 2024,YllaMarciana,"As it promises, it gives you really thick lashes.  Long lasting, doesn't transfer, doesn't clump. Nice formula, I'll add it to my favorite mascaras.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Superb,10 Dec 2024,andibell222,I love this mascara in every aspect.  The packaging is great its easy to hold. I love the brush. I work 12 hour shifts and this lasted all day while I was working . That rarely happens.  At the end of the day there was no flaking.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Good, not perfect",10 Dec 2024,hdev215,"This product worked great! The mascara tube and wand was a little dry, but application looked good!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Thick, volumizing mascara",10 Dec 2024,KaraHolmes,"Cute packaging, like the design of the tube although the functionality of the packaging is very good it can’t stand on its own. No strong smell but is very thick and does what it is supposed to. Adds volume as it is supposed to and is a good mascara overall. I don’t know how well it works in terms of being waterproof or if it smears throughout the day, I haven’t worn it for a long period of time yet. Short term it definitely makes your eyelashes stand out.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Pretty, but subtle",10 Dec 2024,cloverheart,"I got this free by Influencer in exchange for a review. I haven’t tried a high end mascara before this. I have really straight lashes and it’s really hard to hold a curl. For anyone else who struggles with this - I add a little vaseline on a curler before curling and it really helps keep them up. Then I usually apply the mascara. Anyway, I wore this on Thanksgiving and my lashes managed to stay curled all day. The brush is thick and tapers slightly toward the top. For me personally - maybe I haven’t been adding enough, but it doesn’t seem super volumizing. It did lengthen a lot though. I honestly do like the effect. My usual go to mascara is L’oréal Lash Paradise and I feel like it looks similar. I do honestly think I will consider repurchasing once running out.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
New favorite mascara,10 Dec 2024,braeken,This is superior mascara. It is thin and buildable and makes my lashes look unbelievably long and thick. It is thinner than I am used to so I made sure to take some off of the brush and made sure to build instead of slapping a bunch on in one stroke. The brush coats lashes from root to tip.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,10 Dec 2024,Somuriella,This mascara is hands down one of the BEST mascaras I’ve ever used. The wand is amazing not only for the top of my lashes but the bottom as well. It’s buildable and really adds volume and length to my lashes. The perfect mascara 10/10,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
One coat only!,10 Dec 2024,bok88,"Ooh I’m torn on this one! Ii love how wet the formula is, and sleek. It is a bit messy, and I usually do not have any reactions to mascara, but my eyes were slightly irritated after a few hours, nothing terrible. I do not like that it was not a great experience trying to apply a second coat, one coat is nice id you can get away with one coat. I personally need a few coats, and that turns messy with this particular mascara. Lovely one coat.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Overall a nice, long lasting mascara!",10 Dec 2024,LorenDay,"I was excited to try the Fenty Hella Thicc Vilumizing Mascara and it worked well. I have pretty straight lashes and need to curl them in order to get the look I want, and after hours of wearing my lashes were unfortunately straight again. I may not have curled them well enough or put on enough mascara, so I’m willing to try it again because I think it is a nice, long lasting mascara! It’s a pretty waterproof even though that’s not advertised because it took a long time to remove it.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Pretty Decent,9 Dec 2024,trtaylor,"I love the name of this product and it does live up to the name - Hella Thicc. My lashes did appear thicker after just one application. I really like the shape of the tube as well, it feels premium.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Volumizes, lengthens and curls my lashes very well",9 Dec 2024,nloach,"The packaging is chick, classy and durable. No scent.
Aoplication is easy and the wand seperates lashes very well. It Lengthened and curled my lashes beautifully. Also it gives good voluminous lashes and with this i dont need to wear lashes. Great performance according to the price point.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It's a yes!,9 Dec 2024,dreamingofdelta,"Okay, Hella Thick mascara is amazing! It lasted all day without smudging or clumping, giving my lashes a bold, flawless look. Highly recommend!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Daily go to for work,9 Dec 2024,,"Let’s start with the pros- 
Classy and sassy packaging
Product design itself is sleek, classy, and unique
No heavy scent is a huge plus
Application was light and easy
It’s effective in spreading the lashes and having a clean look
The value is also pretty great honestly. It’s not overpriced

The cons- 
The packaging doesn’t state if it’s waterproof or not. 
It did run just a little with sweat, but not much at all and wasn’t really noticeable to anyone else.
I wish the wand was a little curved or spread out to really pull the length, but even so, it still did an amazing job. 


All in all I think this is a great product and over the last few days it has definitely become my go to for work days.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It helps give my eyelashes so much volume,9 Dec 2024,Beauty2590,"This mascara helps give my eyelashes so much volume. I have very straight lashes so it’s hard to get them to look full. You don’t need that many coats, I only used about two and my eyelashes looked very voluminous. I like that the wand is very easy to work with as well.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good mascara,9 Dec 2024,EthelGrace22,"I am pleased with the added length that this mascara provides to my lashes. However, on occasion, I experience watery eyes which causes the mascara to run down my face. While it is easy to remove the mascara from my eyes, it becomes a challenge when my eyes are teary. Packaging is nice, there’s no scent.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love this mascara!,9 Dec 2024,BBCrans,This mascara is awesome! It makes my lashes look so long and doesn't clump them up at all. I love that the color is super black to really make my eyes pop. The brush works well to comb my eyelashes out and separate each one. I really like this mascara and would definitely buy it again. I have already recommended it to friends and family.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s just ok,9 Dec 2024,JpRN1,I received this mascara complementary from influencer in exchange for my honest review. This is mascara is just ok. The formula seems a bit goopy so be careful not to let it transfer. It does thicken the lashes nicely and add some length but if you typically use two coats expect some clumps. It did however last all day and did not transfer once dry. Easy to wash off with makeup remover.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good product - stays on for a while,8 Dec 2024,remyas,I like the packaging. The wand is easy to hold and use. The color is good but I do feel that it clumps a little bit. I have to use an eye lash comb to separate out my lashes but this is true for most mascaras. All in all a good product.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
New fave!,8 Dec 2024,Pikaa,"This mascara is so dark, and I loved the volume and length it gave my lashes. I did not experience any flaking or smudging. This mascara lasted all day!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great Easy To Wear Mascara,8 Dec 2024,SampleRaccoon,You get a lot of pay out with very little effort with this mascara. It really lifts your lashes. The brush is simple and effective and the tube feels nice in hand.  Definitely recommend.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Works great,8 Dec 2024,mnguyen0929,"I heard the hype about this product - and um its amazing. The formula is not too sticky or too slick, barely any clumps even with a lash conditioner applied prior.  I was most skeptical about the brush, as typically my lashes won't cooperate but this was magical, highly recommend to my friends and family. This is by far my favorite mascara. It does not clump and fans out my lashes perfectly.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Dry and impossible to remove,8 Dec 2024,,"I received this item as part of a promotion. I don’t like this at all. The formula feels very dry and flaky, and it does not go on smooth. I also found that removing it was nearly impossible. It’s not waterproof, but it would not come off my eyelashes even after scrubbing. I’m really let down by this and would not recommend.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"If you want volume and lift, you need this mascara",8 Dec 2024,GiniRae,"Grateful to @influenster for sending me the @fentybeauty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara complimentary to try. The color Cuz I'm Black is a rich black that lasts all day without flaking or smudging. It adds lift and volume. The first time I used it there was no clumping at all. But the 2nd time the brush was full of clumps that transferred to my lashes. Once I wiped off the top and the brush it was fine. So I highly recommend doing that after each use. Other than that I do love it! As much as I liked her other one I like this even more. And the price is excellent too! I highly recommend it!

Not the best of Fenty beauty,8 Dec 2024,Ruthiiiie,This mascara definitely volumizes but it smears really bad. If you do a full face after a few hours your under eyes will look black.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
works well!,8 Dec 2024,amyhab,"i really like this formula! i’m so picky when it comes to mascara, but this one held my lashes up. i used the clinique lash primer underneath and the fenty mascara on top, and it definitely held up.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Lives up to its claims,7 Dec 2024,tif22408,"-I love this mascara! It lives up to what it claims. My lashes looked so full, thick, and black after I applied just one coat. The formula is drier which I actually prefer in a mascara. I think drier formula’s are easier to work with and there is less room for error for transferring during application. I applied this mascara on my top and bottom lashes. I Had no issues with clumping even when I built it up. It lasted all day without flaking or smudging. I will definitely continue to use and hope they come out with a brown shade.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Length volume mascara,7 Dec 2024,jennym1234,I put this mascara on my bottom lashes and I do love how it looked. It made them stand out and they looked really dark and a good amount of length and volume. It did transfer a little.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A must from Fenty!,7 Dec 2024,ahall11,"If I could rate this past a 10, I would. This mascara has gorgeous, sleek, modern packaging! The formula is super lightweight, but still gives you the FULLNESS you have always wanted! It is definitely worth the money considering it lasts for at least 8 hours, even with some crying!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Good, but not my fave!",7 Dec 2024,AmberG07,"I really wanted to love this! The package is very try lightweight and the brush combs through nicely, but there is a lot of transfer to the lower lash area and it’s almost too liquidy. I think it will be better with use and once some air gets pumped into it. I love that it’s very black. Overall very pretty, but not the best mascara.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Bold,7 Dec 2024,ucLena,"This mascara goes on the way I like it, not clumpy and looks best when built up in layers. The end results, as you see in my photos, beautiful lashes. I really do not have eye lashes, as you see, So thickening mascara is essential.  I do wish the wand had a curve, but that’s just my preference.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good Value Mascara for Everyday Use,7 Dec 2024,mw9999,"I’ve been testing this mascara for a couple weeks now and have had a great experience so far! The formula is not clumpy, the packaging is cute, and the price is great compared to other luxury mascara brands. The only negative that I could see, depending on your lifestyle, is that it’s not a waterproof mascara by any means. With water, it does run down. And I have noticed a little bit of flaking by the end of the day under my lashes. However, this has not been enough to deter me from using it daily. I may have to transition my everyday mascara to this one because of the great quality for the price!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing mascara,7 Dec 2024,slaywithjessika,This mascara is amazing I love how the Bristle of the mascara  spreads out my lashes it looks amazing and it  won’t clump up what’s so ever. I highly recommend I. Love the dark black  shade it enhances my lashes more,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

My Forever Go-To!,7 Dec 2024,RealShannanigan,"The Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara is everything! It gives my lashes incredible volume and definition, making them look bold and stunning. This is my forever go-to mascara—absolutely obsessed! 🖤✨",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great Mascara,7 Dec 2024,Paola62090,Beautiful packaging as always when it comes to Fenty. Application was smooth and lasted a while. I think the price is a bit steep but it’s a good formula all around!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Nice full lashes,6 Dec 2024,jankask20,I thought this mascara was good. I liked the shape of the wand and the mascara went on nice and smooth. It didn’t clump which is a plus. It made my lashes look full without the chunky look.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,6 Dec 2024,saintxgirl,"So, just look at my pictures!! Hoping you can tell the difference between an eye and the other one, but for me it’s pretty noticeable. Looks great, lasts a lot, it has a nice applicator and doesn’t have a particular smell.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Smudges,6 Dec 2024,cassideb,"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.

I was really excited about this one, but it just didn’t stand the test of time. 

The good:
The brush is amazing, like I’m going to steal this for future mascara applications. The formula is super light, easy to apply and very buildable. Gives great volume, definition, and stays lifted for forever. 

The bad: 
It was definitely dark and smudged under my bottom lash line by dinner time. Not black flakes, dark pigment that looks like dark circles but melted out. I have oily skin, but I figured it would have more staying power than that.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Adds volume and good formula but transfers,6 Dec 2024,NatrlyKurlyKate,"I received this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review.  The FENTY mascara adds a lot of volume without being gloopy or wet when applying.  I enjoyed the brush it prevented the clump effect and really added volume.  I am only giving it 3 stars because although it does what it claims, it transferred to my under eye area and flaked when I tried to apply a 3rd coat.  The photo attached is after 3 coats.  I will use but not on the lower eyelids.  The bottle design is on 
point for FENTY although I wish it could stand up on its own.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Definitely adds volume,6 Dec 2024,BethDarnell,I received this mascara to review. The package is cute resembling a black crystal. It does what it claims to do and adds volume to your lashes. The bristles on the applicator do a good job of grabbing the lashes on the edges I would use this one again.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
So good!,6 Dec 2024,brookey56,Fenty beauty by Rihanna Mascara is great! I love the shape and overall sleek look of the container. It’s easy to grip and hold. The lash brush is a standard brush so no need to adjust or get used to one of the crazy shaped ones. The product goes on rich and dark. I was able to layer and make my lashes pop. It held up well throughout a night out and work days. Overall a great mascara and one I will continue to buy!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Nice mascara,6 Dec 2024,kv012,"I love this mascara! It made my lashes look great, it’s not super lengthening but it doesn’t claim to be either. It doesn’t give me raccoon eyes either",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,6 Dec 2024,samsonite313,"I’m really enjoying the Fenty Beauty a Thicc Mascara. It absolutely does a great job volumizing my lashes. Lasts all day, but will smudge if you rub your eyes. Packaging is really cute, but is very lightweight and kind of cheap feeling. Overall I like it and will definitely purchase in the future. Pictured is one coat of mascara on curled lashes, no primer or liner.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Fenty products are definitely worth every penny!,6 Dec 2024,luxuryche531,I really love how fenty beauty mascara make my eyelashes pop as well as my oldest niece! A little goes a long way. You do not have to worry about it smudging or having a weird smell! I love the simplicity of the packaging and it is very affordable!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,6 Dec 2024,kayf5,"I received this product as an incentive for my honest review from Influenster and Fenty Beauty. 
Fenty Beautiful mascara goes on smooth with its nice fine bristles, and have I have experienced no visible clumps. I have experienced a minimal amount of smearing when first applying, which is typical from applying my rose hip facial oil first, but wipes off easily.. This mascara washes off with a gentle facial wash and I have yet to experience any irritation. It is volumizing to create a thicker lash and buildable according to the occasion.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Nice to start but then raccoon eyes,6 Dec 2024,Beauty52Buff,"Out of the box this has a great feel. I liked the shape of the packaging a lot. I did receive this complimentary for my honest review. When applying it did clump my lashes more than my other mascaras I usually use, but this may have been user error. I did find that at the end of the day I had some raccoon eyes from fallout that I wasn’t thrilled about.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good volume payoff,6 Dec 2024,SavannahP95,The volume payoff was pretty good and the formula didn’t clump either which was great! My only complaint is that the brush is a little clunky and makes it hard to evenly coat the corner lashes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new every day,6 Dec 2024,Brooklynn18,I am not typically a fluffy mascara brush type of girl because I feel like they get clumpy but THIS!!!!!! This mascara is astonishing. It only takes one coat and it gets every single lash. It does have a tendency to fall a little if you use it on your bottom lashes. The packaging is so sleek and cute too! I’m obsessed.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara,6 Dec 2024,Panders3651,The queen of makeup did it again. I’m not a huge mascara girl but this makes my eyes pop and clings to every single last. It was also easy to wash off at the end of the day but held up well throughout the day.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love it!,6 Dec 2024,DariaKrasnova,"Divine mascara! The sleek, stylish tube and chic packaging are on point. It’s easy to apply, and the brush coats every lash perfectly! I’m obsessed with this brand and their products!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It's just meh for me,5 Dec 2024,Tchavon84,I didn't find this to do any more than any other mascara. I love a lot of Fenty products but I would not switch from my preferred mascara to this one.  It's not horrible it just does what it's expected to do.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great volume and length,5 Dec 2024,NM95,"Fenty Beauty’s Full Frontal Mascara is amazing for bold, lifted lashes. The brush is super easy to use, giving great volume and length without clumping. It lasts all day without smudging and comes off easily too, which I love. The only downside is it might dry out a little quicker than some mascaras, but it’s totally worth it for the results. Definitely a new favorite!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Let’s talk lashes!,5 Dec 2024,Teebabiee,Love this mascara! The packaging is sleek and easy to open. I have been looking for a mascara so this campaign came right on time!

Long lasting but a little smudgy,5 Dec 2024,kyyymaw,"Really pretty mascara. I did 2 coats on my lashes, it lasted through work and some crying lol. My only complaint is the mascara isn’t the best to remove it’s pretty smudgy",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Not Bad, Not Great",5 Dec 2024,Vickpapap,"I received this product in exchange for my honest review. This mascara isn’t bad by any means, it lengthens your lashes, defines them, and is a true black shade, but there’s nothing special about it. For the price you’re paying, there is much better out there. L’Oreal Voluminous is very similar, with less clumping, and costs half the price as this. I do like the unique bottle shape, although it can be a bit bulky. The way the wand feels in your hand is great. Overall, decent product, but isn’t transformative, and there is better for your money.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
WOW. I really like this,5 Dec 2024,Jillian420,"So I don’t know if this was reformulated or if I’m misremembering, but I distinctly remember thinking this was clumpy and not right for me, but I really enjoy this now. I like the shape and how it doesn’t roll off a countertop. It really lengthens and lifts my lashes without much smear. The price isn’t bad either. I can sometimes get headaches from certain mascaras and I’m yet to identify an ingredient or scent that triggers it, this is comfortable though. Keep in mind I have thick, long lashes that are stick straight and sometimes even droop, so if you’re a sparse lash girly you may have a different experience.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must have,5 Dec 2024,kkortiz,Love this mascara. It has very sleek packaging which is nice! The wand is nice and thin so it’s easy to apply without getting really clumpy eye lashes. It applied easily and separated my lashes nicely. Wand was comfortable to hold and made applying mascara easy. Mascara was long lasting.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Clumpy mascara,5 Dec 2024,StephanieV01,This mascara was decent it’s not my favorite but it’s still pretty good. The packaging is really neat makes it easy to hold and is a different shape then other mascaras it has a pretty strong smell to it so it might not work for you if your eyes are sensitive. I hated how it applied because it was very clumpy and made my lashes stick together into clumps this wouldn’t be one of the mascara I would recommend using. The price is decent but I still can’t justify it. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Teen daughter approves,5 Dec 2024,ARC227,I gave this to my 15 year old daughter and she said it is definitely one of the best mascaras that she has ever tried. She said the scent was normal and not bad and that the application of it was a breeze. The packaging is nice as well. We will definitely be repurchasing this in the future.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Lovely product,5 Dec 2024,Lotoya1992,Loving fenty products their products are amazing  great mascara soft brush applied smooth no clumps great volume. Easy off looked great no weird smell.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Doesn't smudge, resists humidity, creates volume!",5 Dec 2024,ClaudiaTX,"I am so impressed with this mascara! My eyelashes are stick straight so I have to curl them daily and they don't curl easily. Finding a mascara that won't make them droop is tough. I usually can't apply mascara at the base of my lashes or they'll instantly droop so I just apply at the tips and slowly work down the lash, and apply as many coats until they look good. This mascara was a game changer! I applied just one coat and it went on thick and the color is a deep rich black. I absolutely loved the results! The best part was that there was no fallout! None! I've never had a mascara stay put as long as this one did. It survived one of my worse seasonal allergy days, the insane humidity in Texas, my constant eye rubbing and it even survived when I put on my eyedrops. What can I say? I'm OBSESSED!
*I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not for me,4 Dec 2024,kaywilly3,"Too clumpy, not ideal. Easy application and nice packaging, but simply not a favorite of mine.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
No complaints!,4 Dec 2024,hilaryellen92,"I have zero complaints - as a thickening mascara, you just have to accept that even the best formulas will try to clump if you let them. This one doesn't overly clump, but when you pack it on you can tell it kinda wants to. It doesn't irritate my eyes, or flake or smudge even though I tend to not bother with setting spray most days and I rub my eyes sometimes. It didn't blow me away though, and for the price and shelf life of a mascara, I don't think I would re-buy. I definitely think it's worth a try if you're on the hunt for a new mascara.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Long lasting,4 Dec 2024,lesterini6,"I love the deep black color of this mascara. It applies easily with the wand and lasts all day. I didn’t have any issues with clumping but the formula did feel a little thick to me. The packaging is beautiful! 
Incentivized review",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Perfect look,4 Dec 2024,yroman731,"One of the most important products in makeup is mascara. I used Fenty Beauty's mascara and was amazed. It is a product that lasts and the lashes look perfect, giving an elegant look.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
very pretty,4 Dec 2024,kristinamarie21,i really like the fenty hella thicc volumizing mascara. it apples super smoothly and didn’t clump. the formula is not messy and the brush really separates the lashes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Volumizing but wet,4 Dec 2024,gbry,"Really like the volume this gives. It is a wetter formula so it transferred within the first hour, but I’m used to it due to my eye shape. Would recommend",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
pretty ok mascara,4 Dec 2024,alylolza,This mascara goes on so easily and it is really effective to be honest. I love the packaging and it does not really have a scent which is fine and the wand is great. However it does take a while to take this mascara off even with makeup remover which is kind of annoying,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Applicator had a lot of product but was clumpy,4 Dec 2024,Pdpdpdpd,The applicator holds so much product so I was able to apply so quickly! A little clumpy but it gives great volume. The black was a true black. I wish the applicator wasn’t all the same size but it still worked!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,4 Dec 2024,Luvable2727,I enjoyed trying this mascara. The packaging was simple but the product was great The application and effectiveness passed my expectations. The volume I received was excellent. Would definitely purchase Definitely a value.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not great,4 Dec 2024,samiam2020,"I really wanted to love this Fenty Beauty mascara. The packaging is nice and looks premium. But the product is not great. It doesn't dry fast enough and leaves black smudges on my eyelids. Every time I get hot, it wants to start melting. Under my eyes, look black after a few hours, especially if it's warm out. It's just not a premium product. The brush is pretty good for my liking. Just the actual mascara isn't for me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new go-to mascara,4 Dec 2024,HHuntK,"I am writing this review in exchange for a free trial product of this item.
I struggle with finding a mascara that can do it all- create volume, lengthen, thicken, etc- and this fit the bill. I am sensitive to scents and this didn’t have one. As far as the packaging, it is beautiful although it doesn’t stand upright. This is my new go-to mascara. I used to use two different kinds on top of each other and those days are over. 
See my image for my eyes with and without the mascara on.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love this mascara!,4 Dec 2024,BriannaMRich,Love the look of the packaging that the Fenty mascara came in. The mascara brush isn’t super thick and didn’t have to apply several times to get the full thick lash effect.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Full lash effect,4 Dec 2024,IulianaBil,"Overall, I liked this mascara. The packaging is very good. It looks aesthetically pleasing and attractive. The unusual shape looks very attractive. Excellent rich color of mascara. Gives gorgeous volume to eyelashes. But it has a few lumps when applied to eyelashes. The brush is hard, and combs eyelashes well when applying mascara. Excellent price for such a brand.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Gloopy and Wet,4 Dec 2024,kelseyxox,I received this product free and This mascara was definitely not a favorite of mine. It was very gloopy going on and it was verrrrrry wet. I blinked after putting it on and had mascara allll over my eyes. It also took forever to get off my face. It ended up doing its job but I would not get again.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love,4 Dec 2024,megankruzicki,"Love!! The packaging is so funny to me, but the brush is one of my favorite wands! Does not smear and lasts all day. I would like it to hold my eyelash curl better but it does its job!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing mascara product,4 Dec 2024,beccagreg787,"This mascara is my favorite mascara product today. I received this as a free product from influencer to test and review. Beauty has been one of my favorite brands of makeup to use. This mascara apply so easily to your lashes and last all day. I couldn’t believe at the end of the day when I looked in the mirror and my lashes were still thick and full, and didn’t have any breakage. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to do their make up and wants lashes last lost all day.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara,4 Dec 2024,Klukasik,This is a great volumizing mascara! The wand has super tight bristles that grab every eyelash for that extra plumpness. Also the tube itself is super cute and not your normal boring cylinder shape!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Volumizing and easy to wash off,4 Dec 2024,Lian555,I like this mascara. It was effective at adding volume to my lashes. I also felt like it added some length. I did get some mascara on my eyelids using it. I found the brush a little bit large. I wore it all day and it didn't smudge. It washed off easily with cleanser and didn't cause any lash fallout. I don't know how often I would repurchase this with my own money because it a bit expensive for mascara at $19.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Top 5 Pick,3 Dec 2024,Ddp223,"The packaging is chic and feels high-end.   The wand is effective, and the application is effortless.   Lasts all day without wearing down.  Overall good value.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Volume for value mascara,3 Dec 2024,laurenB44,Definitely adds volume!!! It’s a little clumpy but I just used a lash comb or different mascara brush to even it out a bit. Most surprising is that it didn’t make my eyes water (which most other mascaras do).,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Over 12 hours no smudging or flaking!,3 Dec 2024,AlyssaIsabel,"I gave this product 4 stars because the packaging felt cheap. However, the product itself is absolutely amazing. I love the application wand, it was easy to apply without smudging too much. I love how long it lasted. I woke up at 6 AM & applied this and didn’t come home and wash it off until like 7. So, over 12 hours of wear and (I also should preface by saying I touch my face a lot) no smudging or flaking. I will be using again and restocking when this one runs out!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Raccoon eyes,3 Dec 2024,KTC1988,"I was very excited for this product. I’ve heard this company makes great makeup. I found the formula to be great in lengthening my lashes, however by the end of the day my eyes looked like a raccoon.  I was disappointed the formula flaked.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Almost perfect!,3 Dec 2024,Jennilupey21,"This mascara is amazing & I’ve literally tried them all. The packaging is beautiful. The tube is substantial and the angles on the wand handle allow for nice grip when applying. The brush is dense & slightly tapered for the tiniest lashes and corners of your eyes. I love the formula…it gave my lashes the full, dark, lifted look I love without getting clumpy after the first coat. It missed the 5-star mark because it smudged. My lashes are long & touch below my brows and I’ve struggled to find a non-waterproof formula that doesn’t smudge there. Otherwise a beautiful product overall.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A must have in my everyday makeup routine,3 Dec 2024,JJEN215,I love the aesthetic packaging. This mascara didn’t have a scent to it which is nice. The application 10/10. Long lasting and doesn’t feel heavy on your lashes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Overall okay,3 Dec 2024,vivaladoc,"I received this to review. My girl used this, she liked it. She prefers more volume but says it’s okay for length and separation. She likes the color, the brush size. It combs through lashes evenly. She says it’s not clumpy, she just wants a little more length and volume from it.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Lots of volume,3 Dec 2024,cshee88,The Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc mascara gave my eyelashes a LOT of volume. It only took 2 swipes and my eyelashes were so black and full of volume. It went on smoothly with no clumping. I love the smallness of the applicator. It's not long lasting and does make a black smudge under your eyes after so long but it still made my eyelashes look top notch.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Worth the buy,3 Dec 2024,Liz2208,I received this item for free for my honest opinion and feedback. Absolutely love the packaging of this mascara super cute. The mascara has no scent. I love that this mascara doesn’t leave clumps and brushes out my lashes nicely. For my application technique I only added one coat so I’m sure with a few more strokes my lashes would look a lot longer and fuller. Over all I would recommend buying this mascara as I do like the feel of it on my lashes which makes this a good buy.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Like it!!!,3 Dec 2024,NamiPham,"I like this product because it makes my lashes look voluminous and longer. My eyes are quite sensitive but I use this mascara that doesn't irritate. However, when i apply mascara quickly it tends to clump so i apply it slowly to avoid to the situation.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Does not clump and very long lasting,3 Dec 2024,DeeFrom,"I received this product, complementary in exchange for my honest review. It is very easy to apply, and does not create lumpy lashes. It has very smooth coverage would highly recommend ",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great for every day use,3 Dec 2024,lippemm,"I found this mascara to be great at separating my lashes with no clumping. It was easy to get off and a great option for basic every day use. My only con is that it didn’t have a huge wow factor as far as volume, which is why I would opt for something different for something like a special event.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Nice,3 Dec 2024,LazyLlamasMomma,"This mascara is nice. It has a long wand, making applying it easy, no crazy smells. It went on a little chunky at first due to the brush holding a lot of mascara. I just made sure to scrape the brush on the edge of the container really well before taking it out to use the second time I applied and it worked a lot better.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Looking fabulous,3 Dec 2024,Lilyyuu,"Love the packaging design, is very effective as with just a few applications my lashes looks so long and glow like a natural fake lashes. When it's finished I may consider buying it of course",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
True to its name!,2 Dec 2024,SommerLove,"Great mascara, easy to apply with a cool sleek design. Got results in two coats. Length and volume! Loved the deep black color too. Four stars because it did get under my eyes at the end of the day. But overall, really loved it, and enjoyed the results.

Lengthening and volume enhancing mascara!,2 Dec 2024,wlerrick,Great mascara! I have very short eye lashes and Fenty adds so much volume and length!! Makes my lashes look very full which I love! Easy to use application!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love it,2 Dec 2024,Anderson1988,I use a lot of mascaras but none of them are my favorite. Today I tried the mascaras given by Influenster. I found that they last long and don't run when exposed to water. I really like them.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not a lot of transfer,2 Dec 2024,mrsktsing,"I received this mascara for free in exchange for my honest review. The packaging is very pretty. The scent is typical for a mascara-a good thing. 
Soon application it seemed very dried out and the product was not sticking well. I swiped it 5 times on my hand and thats what is pictured. I would not purchase but I do normally love Fenty beauty products!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
An ok mascara that I would not purchase for myself,2 Dec 2024,WinnieNg,"Fenty Beauty is a great brand makeup, I have been using their foundation for awhile and now have a chance to try out their new mascara products. However, I’m not too impress with this one, it doesn’t curl and make my lashes stays up. The texture is thick but doesn’t help much with people who has straight lashes like me. No smell which is what I prefer. It feel a bit heavy but I really the modern looking packaging. Overall, it’s an ok mascara for me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,2 Dec 2024,carm11,Good mascara! I like the consistency of the product. I wish the wand had more bristles it was hard to apply the mascara without making my eyelashes clumpy. I received this product for free as a sample.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Thicker filler lashes!,2 Dec 2024,twin1980,I was very happy with this mascara.! A few swipes on each lash and my lashes were full and volumized! It lasted all day long it did not clump. Definitely worth the price. Very reasonable!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Beat my go-to mascara of 15 years.,2 Dec 2024,RachelDawn14,I love the sleek look of the bottle. Application was perfect. Good value. I gotta say it beats the brand of mascara I’ve been using for the last 15 years. Ingredients are up to standards for me. No scent but beautiful color.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"A Must-Have Mascara for Long-Lasting, Thick Lashe",2 Dec 2024,SarahAmandaaa,"I’m absolutely hooked! From the very first application, it delivers a gorgeous, dramatic look that lasts all day without smudging or flaking. The formula is thick enough to create impressive volume, but somehow it never gets clumpy, which is a huge win for me. The brush is well-designed, making it easy to coat each lash evenly without any mess. Even with multiple coats, it still maintains that natural, fanned-out look—no spider lashes in sight! And best of all, it holds up in hot weather and long hours at work without budging.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Lovely mascara!,2 Dec 2024,gez33,"Very nice mascara!  Goes on smoothly and isn’t clumpy. I have a lash lift currently so I can’t speak to whether it helps with any curling or not.  Made it through a good part of the day before I started to notice the “raccoon-eyes”. But there are very few mascaras that I don’t end up with some smudging, so I wouldn’t take off for this.  Overall lovely mascara and would consider purchasing again. Product received free from Influenster and Fenty Beauty in exchange for an honest review.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love!,2 Dec 2024,burnsal1,Bottle design is very sleek! Very easy to apply. I received this product complimentary for my honest review.Didn’t notice any scent. Great price point! Very effective and made my lashes very thick and stand out!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Gives volume without clumps,2 Dec 2024,LanaEnot,"I received the Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara complimentary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I have very short, thin, and straight eyelashes, so it’s not easy to find a good mascara that provides enough volume. The Fenty mascara surprised me in a good way. The formula gave me great volume without clumping, and the brush design made it easy to coat each lash evenly and separate them nicely. My lashes looked thicker and fuller, giving me a great look. It also lasted all day without smudging or flaking, which is a big plus. I’m impressed with how well it works and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a volumizing mascara. Love it!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,2 Dec 2024,Alliicceee,"The mascara is actually really thick, it doesn’t clump up when you apply it, and it makes your lashes look really thick. The packaging is nice too, it feels like a nice full bottle. I do think you can get a lot of uses out of it. It’s great!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella Thicc Is Right!,2 Dec 2024,MissyLee5,"This mascara is aptly named. Two light coats is all you need to get Hella Thicc lashes. It goes on thick & wet, and immediately thickens lashes. It doesn't lengthen much, but it only takes one light swipe to get thick, dark lashes. The brush holds a lot of product, and I can do both eyes top & bottom without needing to dip back into the container. The formula is very wet, and will transfer to lids if you aren't careful during application, or if you open your eyes too wide before it dries, but it does dry relatively quick.  Because of the formula, the next morning I did have a bit of smudging on the lower lids, but not too much. 
The packaging is cute but doesn't allow the bottle to stand upright, which isn't a big deal to me. I received this in exchange for my opinion, but the retail price is really fair and I do like this mascara, so I would definitely repurchase at full price. I knocked off one star just because of the slight messiness during application & smudging overnight, but overall this is a great mascara!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Beautiful mascara,2 Dec 2024,LindseyBlack,"Very volumizing, very dark black. Does not have any flaking throughout the day. The brush is very nice and I don’t find it to make much of a mess, it’s easy to apply without any issues.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

I love this mascara !,1 Dec 2024,Madbeaut,"Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara delivers bold, full lashes with a creamy, buildable formula that doesn’t clump or flake.

Disappointed,1 Dec 2024,karena8,"I really didn’t care for the outside packaging of this mascara, but the container of the mascara is really chic and stylish. The  mascara itself really does give you length and fullness. It has a long applicator, which is really nice. However, there can be some clumping and it doesn’t take long before it starts smudging. I just found that annoying. I just want to apply and go and this mascara doesn’t fall into that category.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,1 Dec 2024,Jennifero3,Do not prefer to original fenty mascara. Is too thick and clumpy.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Give it a shot!,1 Dec 2024,DamonCameron,"My wife absolutely loved this. No clumping and looked great all day long. The price point was good as well (20 to 30 dollars), especially with how long it lasted through-out the day. Give it a shot, she really believes that you’ll like it. Sleek packaging as well.

Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good,1 Dec 2024,FaviolaSerrano,I love the sleek packaging that it comes with the wand is great. It gave my eyelashes volume and length it separated all my bottom eyelashes. The texture is nice and creamy.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great length in one coat,1 Dec 2024,Keifer88,"I really liked this mascara. It lengthened my eyelashes in one coat. It went on easily. The brush was easy to use, it reached all of my lashes and was able to coat each one individually . It did not clump. . It stayed on all day. It was easy to remove with makeup remover. I would definitely buy this mascara when I finish this tube.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Awful!!,1 Dec 2024,Alwayshungry10s,"The number of positive reviews here shocks me! 
I need waterproof mascara as I have oily lids and squint alot. 
This mascara literally started smearing after a couple minutes.While it was nice and dark, it did not last at all. 
I do not recommend this to anyone with oily eyelids or those squint their eyes!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella Thic,1 Dec 2024,Sculptsense,Here is another great addition to my favorite mascaras. This mascara just like its name is Hella Thick. Thank you to Fenty for this mascara. You don’t even need two coats in order to see the volume that this mascara can give your lashes. The value is well worth the product and the packaging is really chic. Because this mascara is very thin and volumizing  you need to be carful with clumping. Easy solution is to not pack on too much.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Volume for days!,30 Nov 2024,ljordan,"This mascara gave great volume! The black is an especially deep jet black, which adds to the impact.

I had a tiny smudge under my eye because my eyes have cream on them, but it was tiny and easy to wipe away.  However, I had absolutely no fallout or flakes after an 8 hour work day.  That for me is a huge plus.  The color is beautiful and the volume is excellent.  It is definitely a mascara that lives up to what is promises.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

The sleek and modern packaging instantly stands out, and the brush design makes application effortless, coating each lash evenly for a clump-free, bold look. It delivers impressive volume and lift, perfect for creating dramatic lashes that make a statement. The formula feels lightweight, and there’s no irritation, which is a bonus for sensitive eyes. While it’s practically scentless, the impact it leaves is unforgettable—this mascara truly lives up to its name and is a must-try for anyone looking to elevate their makeup game!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Well…,29 Nov 2024,kno3620,"Packaging is an absolute yes! Color= perfect! However… performance is definitely not it. It does last all day which is a huge plus but does not emphasize your lashes like you’d want it to. My lashes aren’t short but definitely aren’t crazy long either so I feel like it’s perfect for an impartial review. If you want a mascara that lasts than definitely try this but if you are looking for lengthening, curling, or thickening then this is not for you.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good product,29 Nov 2024,xFe4rx,"Love fenty beauty profuct!! Packaging is really cute. No harsh scent, it was effortless to apply to eyes and the application was big enough for me to apply the product to my lashes. I have short lashes but it does seen to give it some length. Would be recommend this mascara.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great volume,29 Nov 2024,DeCee777,Love it! It makes my lashes look long and full. It’s the perfect black mascara for a Smokey eye. Mascara is very thick but does not cake or clump up my lashes. Will last most of the day and washes off quickly. Applicator brush is great and makes the application process a breeze. Did not cause me irritation or discomfort. Would recommend,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
nice black color,29 Nov 2024,felishahhh,"The packaging was standard but the bottle tube was really cute. The brush was ok it kind of made my eye lashes clump, but I just brushed them out. The application was very easy. I used one coat and it was super black and pretty. Throughout the day I did notice a little smudging but overall it wasn't too bad. I really like this mascara and for the price I think it's great.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Bold, dramatic lashes that last all day",29 Nov 2024,OlkaGrim,"The Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara truly lives up to its name! As someone with dark, curly lashes, I’ve struggled to find a mascara that enhances volume and length without clumping—and this one delivers flawlessly. The formula is rich and intense, coating every lash with a deep black color that complements my complexion beautifully.

The wand is designed perfectly for building volume, giving my lashes a dramatic, lifted look without feeling heavy. It lasts all day without smudging or flaking, even in humid conditions, which is a big win.

I love how Rihanna created a product that works for everyone but especially stands out on darker lashes. If you want bold, unapologetically thick lashes, this is the mascara to grab.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
2nd close to lash extensions!,29 Nov 2024,DreaTheDream,"Why do I love this Fenty Hella Thic Volumizing Mascara? I tell you why! It’s easy, smooth application almost gives my short lashes the look of having wispy lash extensions, it is lightweight- doesn’t feel heavy on my lashes, and the color (“cuz I’m black”) isn’t too bright black- more like a natural black while still making my eyes pop. My only issue is that it did clump a little bit in one spot or another on my lashes, but I’ve had this happen with all mascaras in general, so not a big deal. I just gently take it off and reapply a tiny amount to that spot. Overall 5 out 5 would definitely recommend!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love it!,29 Nov 2024,warnz,"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I really like this mascara. It lifts, adds volume as well as lengthens my lashes. The only complaint I have, is that I wasn't a fan of the brush.  It seems really rough, but it still spread on the lashes evenly and didn't clump or stick together.  I would definitely purchase this product in the future.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good but not for my lashes,29 Nov 2024,millreyes,"The Fenty Hella thick mascara does what I claims. It gives you thick, really black lashes. I like the packaging, it is different and feels good in my hand. I gave it 4 stars because it feels heavy on my lashes and drops them.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
This is a must have!!,29 Nov 2024,cpulkra626,The packaging is awesome I love the shape of the bottle. It doesn’t have a strong odor to it. The application brush is a nice full brush. I’m no make up guru but I really like this mascara. I absolutely love how the first ingredient is water!! I can say it’s definitely worth it and I will be buying this!!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,29 Nov 2024,YulieM,"This mascara looks great when applied, does apply volume, however I have notice that throughout the day it starts to smear causing darkness under my eyes. Not only this but it gets to the inside of my eyes and starts to burn.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,29 Nov 2024,mactremain,I really love how voluminizing this mascara is! My lashes look so thick and long. My only complaint is that after a while it transferred and was smeared all over my my under eyes,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new favorite mascara!,29 Nov 2024,CourtneyOlson20,"I received this in exchange for a review. This mascara may be my new favorite! It doesn’t have an overpowering scent which is awesome! It’s not a super clumpy formula and adds a lot of length.
I have allergies and this didn’t make my eyes watery or uncomfortable either. It stays on for hours and doesn’t seem to smudge off, but it washes off easily at the end of the day. I’ll definitely buy it again when I run out.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must have,28 Nov 2024,skyehart,"This mascara is fantastic! I don’t have very long top eyelashes, but when I curl and use this mascara it makes my lashes look fantastic! I have tried SO many mascaras and always end up not loving them. I have only tried the mini size of this, and sometimes the mini is different than the big one, but I have high hopes. This mascara is thick, but it doesn’t clump at all on your lashes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Lots of volume, a little length",28 Nov 2024,flyer45,"Love the dense, cone-shaped brush. This provides tons of volume but not as much length as I’m used to, however I’m very pleased. One coat was enough for a daily look and it wore very well throughout the day. No flaking or smudging, and it washed off easily with soap and water. I would definitely purchase this myself and will happily use what I was given to test, however the price is a little more than I’d like to spend on a mascara when there are drugstore dupes I feel work just as well, if not better.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
If thick lashes are what you want…,28 Nov 2024,ChristyD11,"I received this mascara for free in return for my honest opinion and If thick lashes is what you want, this mascara is for you! My lashes do not have much volume to them at all and this mascara definitely lifts them. I love the look of the packaging. It’s very sleek looking. I love how the spool is thick and it allows the lashes to grab on and lift up. The price is not bad for the product you get either. It’s not waterproof however, I wore this all day and had no smudge or runs at all. I highly recommend you give this mascara a try.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Volumizing and priced right,28 Nov 2024,ApRose,"I have yet to come to come across a Fenty Beauty product that I don’t like and this mascara is no different. The packaging is very sleek and eye catching. I don’t notice any distinct smell with it other than that typical mascara smell. It definitely gives my lashes some volume but I feel like it also lengthened them a little as well. It applied nicely. Dried in a good amount of time and easily wiped off of my skin. I didn’t really notice any flaking but after wearing for 7 hours I did notice some smudging under my eyes. I attached a photo of my top lashes without and then with 2 coats of mascara. I’m a huge mascara person and would purchase with my own money. The price isn’t bad either. $19.00 US dollars. If you’re in the market for a new mascara it’s worth a try. 

**I Received this product for free for an honest review",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Volumizing mascara,28 Nov 2024,FlawsMind,"After using this mascara, I have mixed feelings about it. I like the tube, it's pretty. This mascara made my eyelashes look longer and more volumizing, but it also made my lashes clamp up. I had to separate it with an eyelash comb. I do like how well it held up, it stayed on very well and didn't smudge. There was no irritation, and it felt like nothing was on.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Small brush for easy lower lash application ✨️,28 Nov 2024,vickyevelyn,"I like it so far. I've worn it for a 6 hour shift, and it wore well. It didn't smudge, flake, or irritate my eyes.

Good mascara,28 Nov 2024,Vladislava33,"I finally got it and tried my mascara. I liked. The mascara is not liquid and does not crumble after a while. It smells nice.

Adds length and is great,27 Nov 2024,shenialynn,The packaging is great there’s just a makeup scent and it actually makes your lashes extra long. It adds length.

It gets even my hard to reach lashes. My lashes are blonde and thin. This gives me volume, curl and thickness. It didn’t clump or give me spider eyelashes. No flaking or smudging.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
The brush needs a re-design,27 Nov 2024,sistersofavalon,"I have been on a quest to find the best mascara for the last year. I typically end up going for one with a plastic brush because I find that they tend to make my lashes look fuller and less clumpy. I was very excited to try the Fenty Hella Thicc mascara, since everything else that I’ve tried from Fenty has been awesome. First thing I noticed is that I hate the brush design. It’s your classic soft mascara brush and it was pretty clumpy from the beginning. I had to apply several coats before it was even evident that I had mascara on, but ultimately still looks pretty good. If the brush was plastic, I’d rate it much higher. Still a big fan of the Fenty brand though!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Highly recommend for lash lovers,27 Nov 2024,chrisitnaw1026,"Fenty Beauty's Hella Thick Volumizing Mascara is a standout product for anyone seeking bold, dramatic lashes with minimal effort.  I’m genuinely impressed by its performance and quality.

Wouldn’t buy,27 Nov 2024,momo1994123,"So I personally do not like the comb brush on this mascara. The bristles are too short so it’s hard to get all the excess mascara and separate the lashes so in person my eyelashes look very clumpy. These photos are with one layer of mascara. After 4 hrs of wear I did get smudging under my bottom lashes but that’s normal for all mascaras for me, I have to wear waterproof on my bottom lashes.

Great for wearing everyday or just on special occasions.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s a pass for me,27 Nov 2024,Stevenson383,"I love the Fenty brand so much but this particular product is a bit of a miss for me.

Wouldn’t Recommend,27 Nov 2024,GWright123,"A little disappointed in this mascara tbh! I normally wear waterproof mascara but this one claimed to be sweat, humidity, and transfer-proof so I gave it a try. The packaging was a major let down. I like the shape, but it felt of similar quality to a covergirl mascara, definitely not something worth $19. The product itself is nothing special, very basic fluffy wand that was not great for separation. The formula wasn’t a hit for me either - didn’t hold a curl and definitely not any type of “proof” because just sitting at my work desk all day, it was smudged under my eyes by the end of the day. Pretty shocking honestly because I’d expect a lot better from this brand.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Smudges,12 Sep 2024,gnikki123,The mascara smudges so much. Very disappointing. No amount of setting spray makes a difference.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Don’t waste your money,11 Sep 2024,faith25321,I don’t recommend it clumps and smudges on my eyelids making my eyes look like raccoon eyes. I was honestly disappointed because I love Fentys products.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I wish this worked,10 Sep 2024,jayelizard,"Incredibly goopy and takes forever to dry. Definitely must curl eyelashes before applying, but I just find that I'd rather use my old dried up mascara than reach for this. There are too many clumps and smudges that it takes a lot of manipulating and I often have to fix my eyeshadow or base from the black. I wish I liked it.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Volumizing,5 Sep 2024,,This mascara is awesome when it’s new. I’ve had mine for a while and it’s dried out and not working as well anymore but I really liked it when I first got it. My only complaint is it’s not waterproof.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

The Struggle felt Never Ending Until....,26 Aug 2024,poetrynation,This mascara gave me so much volume BUT had too many Drawbacks - Takes way too long to dry upon application; smudges like crazy and it's a pain to remove. I ended up on a year and a half long search looking for another mascara! And...that's when I found Rare Beautys Volumizing mascara and all that struggle went away - No Smudging even in 88 degree weather; Volumizing and easy to remove. FINALLY!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara,20 Aug 2024,,This added quite a bit of length to my lashes.  It's very matte and seems to dry quickly,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,19 Aug 2024,whitte1,I feel so beautiful with this mascara. Bold and gives me plenty of length. Great formula!!!!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
nice packaging. the formula is nothing special.,15 Aug 2024,Captivatingee1,Had to return this. Was disappointed with the formula. The packaging was beautiful but I wasn't impressed at all with the formula. Yes it's thick but it went on in globs. I wasn't sure if it was a used tube because when I opened the package the tube was unscrewed and the wand was smeared. So who knows. But I did not enjoy this mascara.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Transfers like crazy!,13 Aug 2024,brunettejett,"After using this product multiple times, I returned it to the store. It smudged almost immediately. I can only imagine what I would have looked like shopping in the tx heat with this runny mascara.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

"Not a fan, unfortunately",27 Jul 2024,Samanthalovew,"I wanted to love this but not a fan. Barely any material stuck to the brush and when it did, it was just clumps and made my lashes clumpy. It also constantly rubbed off onto my upper eye lids and smears",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara!,26 Jul 2024,Embeauty49,"This was probably one of the best mascaras I’ve ever tried! It really lengthened, thickened and added volume to my lashes. The only downside is that I found it would transfer and leave black under my eyes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My favourite thickening mascara,17 Jul 2024,bandcandy,"This mascara is amazing if you’re looking for dramatic powder finish lashes. If you like maximal makeup this might be for you - pairs amazing with graphic eyeliner, smoked out eyes for an edgy look. If you’re looking for a natural finish this might not be the mascara for you - personally I love the way it pops my eyes",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Didn’t like it at all,13 Jul 2024,Sabribri99,I was really disappointed when using this mascara it gets very clumpy and just overall very messy. Also I wish it was waterproof. They should remake this whole product.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love this,10 Jul 2024,,"I have been using this mascara for over a year now, my lashes have never looked this good before. Even though it’s not water proof I still love how it has volume as well.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Lengthening, But Leaves Undereye Smudges",9 Jul 2024,ClemLee13,"I really wanted to love this product since I haven't been let down by the Fenty brand before. Unfortunately I'll be returning though since it leaves undereye smudges. Spending time doing up my face only to have to wipe away smudges throughout the day is not a win for me. The wand itself is great and separates and lengthens, but I hope they improve their formula in the future.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Don’t buy.,7 Jul 2024,jesscla4302,This mascara sucks. Can pay $5 for a dollar store mascara and it would work better.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
One of the worst,5 Jul 2024,Ruokanne,I didn’t like it. The product clumped up around the brush after a week of use and dried out within 2 weeks. Honestly do not know how this mascara is so highly rated. I would not use this again.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I like this,5 Jul 2024,shainf,"I like this mascara a lot 
It stays on well
No transfer under my eyes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,4 Jul 2024,AxelPrincess,Top mascara. Buildable black thick . Doesn’t flake or clump. But takes days to get off. So much mascara,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not for me,29 Jun 2024,lniq,This just makes my eyelashes so clumpy. It also has no staying power and gets all over my eyes and underneath. I’m not oily so this never happens to me. I probably won’t even finish it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,27 Jun 2024,annniieee,"I don’t like it personally. It makes my lashes look Chucky rather than full. But if that’s what you like, I’d recommend it. Good quality, doesn’t smudge easily. & the geometric packing is great,keeps it from rolling away when set down.  keeps it",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A Daily Mascara,23 Jun 2024,calidezz,This mascara is fantastic! A nice deep rich black mascara that goes on smooth without clumping or smearing giving lashes both definition and volume. This is my new go-to.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,23 Jun 2024,elenafhw,This mascara lengthens lashes and stays on all day for me. And it’s a great price! My only drawback is that it can clump up if you are not careful applying it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Good product just not for me,15 Jun 2024,caramelsunde76,Not what I was expecting. Great mascara if you are looking for thicker lashes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Genuinely awful mascara,15 Jun 2024,missmissajade,"Clumpy.. generally awful mascara. I LOVED Full Frontal, that one looked like lash extensions. It had zero flaking, smudging or clumping but I guess a lot of people had bad experiences with it. I don’t know what happened there because when I bought it, it was genuinely the best mascara I’d ever used and I’m not young or new to makeup, I’ve tried many! I’m sad that instead of investigating they scrapped the whole product and replaced it with this one. Now this one I do NOT understand. It’s definitely one of the worst mascaras. Smudging, flaking and clumping is all I got from this. I also liked the other wand better. Begging for Fenty Beauty to bring back Full Frontal and just fix whatever issues some were finding with it because mine were truly perfect",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s a no for me,14 Jun 2024,Yaudi,Smears badly and clumps up. It’s too thick for my liking. Not the best product.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

,7 Jun 2024,MissJolly7,The produxt is too thick and clumpy in my experience.  The wand always had too much product and gave me horrible eye itch. I barely used my mascara.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
the best mascara I own,6 Jun 2024,ciarahh,I love this mascara it separates my lashes perfectly nor does it way them down at all and apparently it seems to be pretty long lasting in water when i went swimming today it didn’t budge or clump together 🤷‍♀️,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Girl... Best Mascara I have ever Used!!!,3 Jun 2024,JustJulesB,"Ok Fenty.  You win.  this is my new favorite mascara hands down.  Where have you been all my life.

Thank thank thank YOU!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Cute but raccoon,2 Jun 2024,nwill4,I love the look of the mascara. It does get a bit clumpy but I don’t mind that. What bothers me though is I personally get raccoon eyes from this mascara.

Clumps easily look for something else,15 May 2024,maracuya626,I bought this mascara about 2 months ago and I’m disappointed.

I actually liked it until it started to clump.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Absolutely not,28 Mar 2024,kvanbur2,"I had a Sephora employee come up to me in store to ask what I was looking for... I told him I had been using and liking Lancôme Lash Idole but was tired of spending so much each time.

Not suitable for dewy or oily skin,24 Mar 2024,mirandadawn,"I really wanted to like this product. But I ended up with raccoon eyes within the first hour of wear. I have dry to combination skin.

SO good BUT...,5 Mar 2024,Justeve398,"I haven't been as in love with a mascara in so long...but it's a bittersweet love affair!! I adore how this mascara literally reaches and pulls out EVERY lash I never knew I had. It darkens, thickens, volumizes, extends, fans out, and lifts in one swipe! The bliss is short-lived however...I've never had a mascara transfer SO bad under my eyes. :( I can bet that every time I look in the mirror I will look like a raccoon. It messes up my whole look, EVERY day!!  I want to give this 5 stars SO BAD. Fenty, PLEASE fix this formula!! You'd have a true gem on your hands!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Lives Up to The Name,3 Mar 2024,Taiyari,"This mascara lives up to its name. It’s thick to the point where I have to clean some off the brush before application. If I don’t, it’ll clump and look awful. It’s so hard to remove and leaves residue which makes my eyes look dark.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Made my natural lashes fall out,28 Feb 2024,ihatethisssssss,I received this by using my rewards points and wanted to like it but it made my long lashes shrivel and lashes fall out.

The only thing preventing me from giving it a 5⭐️
Is the transfer! You have to constantly check and clean the smudges.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Good price, good mascar",21 Feb 2024,kittybear,"I really like mascara, it separates and lengthens my lashes so well! My only dislike is that I do have to check for light transfer under my eyes after a while. It cleans up easily, and I just add a bit of powder after. My holy grail mascara was made by a brand called Prescriptives, and their Beyond Long mascara was the GOAT. I still haven’t found a mascara as good as that, but the search continues. 

In the mean time I’ll keep using this bc it does work well; lashes get length and fullness from this mascara. The application of this mascara is close to Beyond Long, but the transfer issue means it’s still not a replacement. I will buy this again.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Basically sitting in my makeup drawer.,31 Jan 2024,JustAle,I really wanted to like it but it’s not worth the money. The formula is clumpy and my lashes fall right after I apply it.

Must have for short sparse lashes,21 Jan 2024,HiHoSilver,I love this product because it makes my short sparse lashes stand out and look full. Before this I used Lancôme Monsieur Big Mascara (for a long time). I have gone through 2 tubes and never disappointed. Try it out. I hope you love it too!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Its a NO! Unless you're going for the rough look,21 Jan 2024,12Gina,"At first I was in love with how my lashes looked. After 5 uses this mascara will make your lashes clump, leaves so much product on them,  your lashes will stick together and will not separate when brushing with the wand, and overall looks like you had a rough night prior to even leaving your house. Removing the wand from the tube will have so much buildup of product.  I wish I could return and get my money back. This mascara is awful.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,20 Jan 2024,marlssd,I do not like it. Made my lashes fall as soon as I put it on and very clumpy. Very disappointed because I love so many of Fenty’s other products.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

It left my lashes SUPER long and thick!! One coat is truly all you need!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Tammy Faye Baker Lashes, Here I come.",19 Jan 2024,Warflowers,"This clumps so bad! It is also hard to distribute through long lashes. In addition, it has minor fallout. Does remove easily, which is nice. I cannot recommend this product.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Terrible. Needs a reformulation.,18 Jan 2024,paisliefarrow,If I could give this zero stars I would. A: the brush sucks. You can’t even coat your lashes with the brush. It just looks full of clumps. B: it just looks full of clumps and you can’t get it on your lashes to look nice no matter how hard you try.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
THE BEST MASCARA EVER. 100% recommend,17 Jan 2024,maddiegeist,This mascara makes my lashes pop. And I swear my natural lashes have grown since using it. I have used so many mascaras and I swear by this. I got this at a sample at first then I got full size,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Intense look but clumpy,9 Jan 2024,Aurahi,"After using this product for a month, not my favorite as it’s a bit clumpy. Carefully combing thru the eyelashes when applying helps. I like the intensity of the color though, makes my eyes pop!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Wont be repurchasing,8 Jan 2024,Tasmanian,"This was not all that whatsoever,I expected my lashes to have the volumizing effect and they did not even after applying 2 to 3 coats ,wont be repurchasing",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I wanted to love this,7 Jan 2024,iconMUA,"I'm only giving it 2 stars because it has a great brush. The bristles are a firm nylon, and distributes product evenly. I have long, thick, but sparse lashes. 

I've never experienced ""racoon eyes"" mascara before this. It is a heavy, oily, formula. So, when you apply it on the lashes, it not only weighs down the lashes, it takes a looong time to dry. Then, when it is finally dry, undereye powder is applied, you think you are good to go - but then it still manages to melt around your eye area. 

Lancome's Monsieur Mascara, YSL's Lash Clash, and Too Faced's Better Than Sex mascaras are worth the money instead of this one.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not recommended,5 Jan 2024,AimeeFawn,"This mascara made a complete mess of my under-eyes only a few hours after applying it to my lashes.

Not my favourite mascara,2 Jan 2024,NedeaIulia,"It felt old as soon as I opened it. Very clumpy but it doesn’t smudge and it’s long lasting. However, I can achieve the same thing with drug store mascara. Pretty disappointed",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Bought 3 bottles and Santa gave me 2 more,1 Jan 2024,glomanni,"Let’s just say….I’m stocked for the whole year. I initially received a sample from Fenty when they visited UH. I suffer from blepharitis and I can only use an essence mascara. However, essence princess mascaras doesn’t give me the dramatic fullness. I’m shocked. My eyelashes look SO GOOD! It does everything it claims and doesn’t smear on me. I don’t get styes, Chalazions",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Looks great but flakes sometimes,19 Dec 2023,Sasha00Fierce,This mascara is alllllmost perfect. The formula looks great on and you can build to some really dramatic volumized looks. However the tradeoff is that over time the mascara flakes and gets into your eyes over time.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,15 Dec 2023,mutheulynn,"I bought this mascara earlier this year after seeing people recommend this product on instagram. Unfortunately, it is too thick for me and clumps my eyelashes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
The name of this product is exactly what you get,13 Dec 2023,Mangoluva,"This mascara is good for volume, not lengthening. It makes you look like you have on false lashes after a few swipes.

Super smudgey!,9 Dec 2023,cinncinn,"I purchased this after I someone reviewed this. They said it was a great combo with the Telescopic mascara for straight lashes. Let me tell ya, I tried them together as a combo and both separately and they are both terrible. I really hate to say this but the Fenty one was just a bit worse. It smudged almost instantly and consistently throughout the day. Fenty has other wonderful products but this one was a miss.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Good,28 Nov 2023,urmoder,This really did make my eyelashes hella thicc! But it bleeds really easily so I end up having a black eye by the end of the day. So I would advise not to use this on your bottom lashes,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Could be good for a photoshoot maybe?",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I LOVE FENTY 🩷,25 Nov 2023,imkiwi,It’s so much better than drugstore mascara. It separates my lashes so well. I feel so freaking fine when I wear it. Only ever buying Fenty! My mom wants one as well. I know what her next gift will be.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Save your money,25 Nov 2023,Samgreen2111,It’s an okay mascara in general but I’ve never had as much smudging with a mascara before. I look like a raccoon after like 2 hours and it’s just not worth it. Honestly been really disappointed with fenty eye products,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

,20 Nov 2023,soulbeautyfulx,Love this mascara but the smudging 😭 I’d love if it were waterproof or something. The black is very dark & gives great length to lashes which u LOVE.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not as good as Full Frontal,20 Nov 2023,Chrissy400,"I bought this because the Full Frontal is out of stock.  It's ok, but very goopy and does transfer. I'll use it until the Full Frontal is back in stock but I wouldn't repurchase.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"I use this every day , I love it!",20 Nov 2023,Gabb4747,"Look girlies, I am one who barely has any lashes and this mascara here…IS MY HOLY GRAIL! I use her everyday. Only thing is , is that it might take a good makeup remover, cleaner to get her off.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

In Love!!!!,13 Nov 2023,spookygurl,"I have very long lashes but they are straight so you can’t see them and whenever I curl them and/or use mascara they always fall down in like 1 minute after applying but THIS MASCARA let me tell you I have
 tried tons of mascara and none have kept my lashes up and curled but Ms Rihanna came through this mascara keeps my lashes up all day and keeps them curled and it’s transfer proof but also very easy to remove with just soap and water love this and def gonna repurchase tomascaras",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Can’t seem to completely love this..,13 Nov 2023,reneeerika,I will say this is very pretty if you have long lashes already but I can’t see myself using this as an everyday mascara. It started flaking within the first hour of use. It got clumpy really quick as I started applying it. It would be amazing if they fixed these specific issues with it. I had really high hopes. I do still think it is really nice and has great potential.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Ripped my lashes,12 Nov 2023,GizemT,Looked great but ripped half my eyelashes when removing. I am in shock. My eyes also burn. Wow,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Looks great but smudges:(,12 Nov 2023,AJDtown,"I would give this mascara 5 stars for the incredible length and volume without clumping BUT it smudges all day long. I have deepest eyes/oily lids so this is a constant issue for me, maybe if you have dry lids you’d be more k?you have dry lids/ have",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Sexy but smears,11 Nov 2023,kandy44,"I have tried a lot of mascaras and I have to say, this is a great lengthening and thickening mascara. Dramatic and sexy. But like everyone else has mentioned, it transfers very easily. Doesn't matter if you let it dry, it still finds a way to your lower lids by the end of the day. I find it's worse if I'm wearing any under eye concealer. It's somehow weirdly difficult to remove with standard eye make up remover though. I got this as a sample and would have loved to buy full size but I think this will be for a ""dinner date only"" mascara, and not an everyday one",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
AMAZING,10 Nov 2023,teagan996,"got a mini from points BUT sooooo volumeizing and creamyyyy. EASY TO TAKE OFF but cry proof, its not sticky after you put it on. the pic is js after crying",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"so thick, lumpier than I'd like",10 Nov 2023,MoosieJ,"I loved the sample size version, but the full size is so thick, I have to wipe so much off the applicator each time I use it. My eyelash brush is necessary to tidy the lumps out.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Requires maintenance,5 Nov 2023,amdisi,The immediate results are amazing. Unfortunately this formula flakes off my lashes. I need to clean up my under eye area every few hours when I wear this mascara. I do love the volume it adds to my lashes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Transfers,4 Nov 2023,kareeennn,"The formula itself is very dark but super wet. The wand bristles are soft but can get easily cluttered. First time I used it, without curling my lashes, it applied clumpy and spidery. Second time I curled my lashes before application and it went on a lot better but after about 5 hours of wear it started transferring to my lower lash line. I’ll give it another try but it’s not looking so hot.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Transfers to your under eye.,2 Nov 2023,VoPet,"This mascara will transfer to your under eye in 30 minutes of wearing it. I can touch my lashes slightly and my finger will be black. I have to go in with a q-tip to make it look like I don’t have a 
black eye when wearing this. I never leave reviews but I had to for this.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Better than average,31 Oct 2023,princessgracie,"Better than anticipated. I normally love the ysl mascara but they don’t carry it at my store. I don’t feel like driving over an hour or waiting for it. The SA suggested this. While it’s not comparable, I do like it. I ended up buying a two pack from the holiday collection as well. It didn’t smear or rub. Length and volume average.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Will give you a black eye!,31 Oct 2023,MOMINABRARASHID,I got this mascara in deluxe size in one of the Sephora holiday gift sets. It clumps really bad and bleeds everywhere.

Dramatic look,27 Oct 2023,raina19,Mascara is a staple in my makeup routine. That’s being said I’ve tried a lot of mascaras over the years. I really like this one!

Lives up to its name!,24 Oct 2023,seatwothree,"It looks like I'm wearing falsies when I wear this. It lives up to its name-- hella thicc, indeed! (When you use it, just make sure to give it time to dry. It's a very wet formula and can be a bit messy when you don't give it proper time to adhere and dry.) Wear time for me varies. I've had some days when it will smudge by noon and other days when it will stay put until I take it off.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Must Try,20 Oct 2023,lindserati,Love after first use. I first got a free sample & fell in love. It doesn’t clump and goes on so smoothly. I bought a regular size immediately. I naturally have pretty long lashes & this mascara almost makes it look like I’m wearing falsies,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

New Favourite!,16 Oct 2023,teenyyogini,"I had been searching for a new mascara since my favourite had been discontinued. Whenever I try a new mascara it must: Be volumizing, lengthening, not flake, SUPER black, and fan the lashes out well. I am thrilled to say that this one hits all the marks! After buying an individual mascara, I ended up buying the 2-pack gift set a week after just so that I'll have it as back-up, that's how much I love it! Worth noting, if you have oily lids, ensure you use some setting powder under your brow to soak up any excess oil to avoid any transfer, as it certainly can if your lids are oily (started to transfer after 14 hours of wear, but no probs before!)",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

The brush is good and it went on nice but within 2 hours it was transferring to my top lids and flaking off! I had to take it off before lunch to avoid looking like a hot mess. It might work better for someone else but was a hard pass for me.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
One of my favorite mascaras,18 Sep 2023,bry082,This mascara is so good. It doesn’t have any fall out and it makes my lashes look so long and it’s a reasonable price!!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,17 Sep 2023,Ciciesq,"To test this mascara, I used some on one eye and on the other I used my current favorite from Lancome. I curled my eyelashes on both sides and held my eyelash curler in the same place for the same amount of time on both eyes. The Fenty mascara is so too wet and immediately made my eyelashes lose their curl. My Lancome mascara doesn't affect the curl in my eyelashes at all. I was very disappointed in this product.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Smudges really badly!!,15 Sep 2023,mascaragal27,I absolutely LOVE  the way this mascara looks when immediately applied… but by midday…. holy smudge fest lol I looked like a raccoon! SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I really wish this mascara smudge because it really looks beautiful,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Chunky and awful,15 Sep 2023,SaraCoults,"This is the clumpiest, worst mascara I have ever used. It all comes out in a giant chunk and gives you 3 really thick eyelashes. Threw out.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I’ll never use another mascara,15 Sep 2023,NikkiP82,My holy grail. Ride or die. Cannot live without. I’ve used many mascaras over the years. This is the best.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
All over my under eye :(,14 Sep 2023,BeautyntheBree,"This goes on well and looks beautiful, but I’ve noticed that after a few hours, I have black all over my under eye. I tested this a few times and can confirm. This is the only disappointment from Fenty- all other products I LOVE!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

,12 Sep 2023,natasha14737,"This mascara transfers so easily on my skin. I have long top and bottom lashes, so by mid day I look like I have raccoon eyes. It does a good job separating my lashes though so I’m very sad that it didn’t work for me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good for EVERY lash type!,12 Sep 2023,ciarakay08,Girllll rihrih can do NO wrong. This is some of the best mascara I’ve ever had hands down,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great coverage!,12 Sep 2023,Fashionista031,Love this mascara! I love the thin applicator. It feels like it applies to every single eyelash!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Absolutely Amazing,11 Sep 2023,CaityQueenB,"Absolutely in love. Definitely the best mascara I’ve ever tried. I’m somebody who tends to like to do a bit more “over the top” looks, and this is such an amazing addition that I truly don’t need falsies. Absolutely in love. Perfect as well for everyday use when you lashes need a bit of a pick me up.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

My favorite,10 Sep 2023,akicz,My favorite mascara by far. Coats my lashes perfectly with no clumps or flaking. I use a lash comb with this and it makes my lashes look even more amazing.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A must have,9 Sep 2023,ilila,"I love this mascara, it makes my lashes look long and beautiful.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,8 Sep 2023,mrsdyer5,I was expecting better from this mascara. It is flaky and clumpy. The formula needs some work for sure.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Do not recommend,7 Sep 2023,Mmayelita,"I love Fenty products, but was very disappointed with this mascara. I’m all about mascaras, honestly do not recommend it. At the end of my work day it was smeared under my eyes and I work indoors!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Average,6 Sep 2023,lastrosebeauty,Out of the many types of mascaras I tried I would have to say this one was on the more average side. It gives my lashes a nice length and voluminous look but a few coats and it starts clumping up. I use my clump breaker comb before it dries and that does the trick. Some mascaras are irritating but this one wasn’t for me.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I like it,6 Sep 2023,LalaMarie1986,"I was scared to try this after reading some of these reviews, but it wasn’t bad. It was a little clumpy but I wore for a fee hours in the Florida sun with no smudges or smears. It did make my lashes look nice and dark !",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It's a no go for me,6 Sep 2023,katiekates66,Got this as a bonus sample...it's an ok mascara with one coat; nothing super special.  Two coats and forget it - clump city!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
for us girls with no lashes,4 Sep 2023,amandann,"It's definitely better than the 1st mascara Fenty came out with. I usually wear about 3-5 coats because I love the spider look of lashes. I've been wearing it for a while now, and no smudge, no leaks so far.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love it  but it flakes towards the end of day,4 Sep 2023,Luckymommy5,"I fell absolutely in love with the mascara, but unfortunately towards to end of the day the mascara started to flake. Also my lower lashes are longer so it does transfer a bit. It does help to have a little setting powder there to help with the transfer, but over all loved the application and it gave amazing length and fullness without being too chunky looking",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My fave mascara,4 Sep 2023,Mizak,"My face is insanely sensitive when it comes to makeup, especially my eye area. When I tell you not only does the Fenty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara not irritate my eyes but gives AMAZING coverage! I'd say i have decent lashes to begin with but this mascara gives an even coat, no glopy mess this way. The mascara wand is the perfect size. I did also noticed that the tip of the mascara wand doesn't accumulate access mascara which is a huge plus for me. The container itself is the perfect size as well. It full size yet compact enough to toss in my purse and go! The Fenty brand is an overall win. *free product in return for my opinion*",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Finally able to see my lashes during chemo,3 Sep 2023,kristenB322,"When I first found out that I was receiving this product for free in exchange for a review i was disappointed. I’ve been going through chemotherapy for breast cancer for the last few months and my lashes are sparse and short. Id tried a handful of mascaras in the last month or two and was always let down by promises of volume, length, and curl. 
This mascara is extremely black which I love and was super helpful in making the few lashes I do have stand out. The brush is nice and really gripped onto the base of my lashes making it easy to coat even the ones in the corner of my eye. This mascara really delivers on volume and finally made me feel like I didn’t have to apply falsies to wear eyeshadow. I’m super excited to see how amazing this truly is when my lashes grow back after chemo. I did take away a star because i don’t completely love how this dries down; after 6-8 hours of wear it became flaky for me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I loooovvvveeee this product,3 Sep 2023,NosethatKnows,I have not last and this product give me a full fake lash look instantly. I love the length and the fullness,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Clumpy really bad,2 Sep 2023,joceeeeeee,"After using this it left my lashes so clumpy, it dragged them down, and it transferred a lot!! Would not buy this!!! Definitely not worth $20!!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,2 Sep 2023,SweetSuzie,"Really wanted to love this. However, it was clumpy, and dry. It dried out in less than a month.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not the greatest,2 Sep 2023,makeupbabe321,It’s ok. Not my favorite. I wish it didn’t clump so much.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good!,1 Sep 2023,kenziekenny,I got this as a sample that I used with my points. I usually use superhero “it” mascara and I think I actually like this better I am going to purchase the full size.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Save your money,1 Sep 2023,tiffanye,It clumps and takes forever to dry. Then it flakes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must have!,31 Aug 2023,alesau75,Love the design for the product first off. I also love that it actually works! It doesn’t take much for you to see results and last all day . I love it!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
This is a must have,31 Aug 2023,asaulen,This is the best one yet! I love hushing for a full face or just a quick trip to the store. Always looks natural and definitely doesn’t run in the crazy heat and humidity!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Best mascara yet for short lashes,31 Aug 2023,CaPriel,Instantly after applying this mascara you can see all the magic. I don’t have any lashes but with this I could get away without applying lashes and I wouldn’t look like something in my look was missing. It also doesn’t dry up on you as your applying which makes it easier to apply as many coats as you please.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Beautiful long lashes,30 Aug 2023,Canija,"I had two people ask me if I was wearing fake lashes because of this mascara. That’s the ultimate compliment! No clumping, no running, just beautifully elongated super black lashes. I will be switching to this mascara over all others.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
meh.,29 Aug 2023,serpentinasolis,This wasn't great. Very meh. It was really thick and clumpy. The brush was very generic. I'll stick to my Caliray.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Fenty Fenty Impressed,29 Aug 2023,Lollipopmissfit,"I have to say that i would spend my own cash on this mascara. The smooth formula is distrubuted through my lashes nicely. Not clumpy. I go the extra mile with mascara because i usually only wear mascara or eyeliner to quickly leave the house. I took my time to curl my lashes and seperate in between coats. It was worth it. I usually dont feel comfortable applying 3 layers of mascara with drug store brands. This mascara really spreads nicely on my lashes. I have pretty thick black lashes. So, making my lashes clumpy is not hard lol. This mascara did not clump up easily.I was really impressed when i saw how my undereye lashes looked with one coat. ""I received something in exchange for this post (free product, payment, sweeps entry)""",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Solid mascara,29 Aug 2023,cici2013,It has great pigment and lengthening but I felt like it was clumpier than I prefer. All in all it's good for a low impact makeup look but it didn't have too much staying power of I was really active and moving a lot,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good Mascara,29 Aug 2023,AlesUnderland,"I received this mascara from BzzAgent in exchange for a review. In my honest opinion, this is a really good mascara. It’s easy to layer, doesn’t smudge, and has good separation.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,28 Aug 2023,drax,"light weight, hella dark, and ive cried in it with no runs♡",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,28 Aug 2023,natalymunoz22,"Very voluminous and gives your eyes the perfect depth to them , the only thing is the lift didn’t stay too long",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Absolutely love,27 Aug 2023,MsSpB,"A must have staple in my makeup routine. It’s long lasting, water, tear AND smudge proof yet incredibly easy to remove. I prefer this one over my MAC one.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not for me,27 Aug 2023,chelsss5,Disappointed in this mascara. Very smudgy - I can’t wear this mascara for more than a couple hours without having smudges. I also find it more difficult to remove than other mascaras. Formula is very thin so it doesn’t seem to stick to the lashes as well. Will not repurchase.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love but….,26 Aug 2023,Zyiii,I loved this mascara but it be like smearing under my eyes so much like and its kinda annoying after a while and it makes it look like my under eyes are really dark but my under eyes have been dark but they look darker.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Curly lash queens,26 Aug 2023,morganpshyra,I have pretty curly unruly lashes and this mascara was great for separating and adding volume. My lashes are already long so I don’t go for mascara that adds length as much I prefer volume and I want my mascara jet black. This definitely delivered. The formula didn’t provide messy application and the color was jet black. I love it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Gets the job done,25 Aug 2023,Vivipanda,"I used on my naked lashes without curling. It was a little clumpy but did make my lashes look thicker and and longer. I noticed some fall out under my eyes throughout the day but that is an issue with a lot of mascara and liners for me. It feels buildable but is not waterproof if that is what you're looking for. It is comparable to other mascara's, but didn't wow me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
From a Mascara HATRER,25 Aug 2023,Mokca,"Hey there folks! So, I have to share this. I used to really avoid mascara because in the past, it just felt too heavy and created such a mess. But, guess what? I've had quite an exciting change of heart! This product I've found is just super adaptable. Depending on how much you apply, you can totally go for a bold or a laid-back look.
What's more, it's actually comfortable! Many mascaras I've used in the past were far from it. The only tiny hiccup is that it looks a bit ashy, but honestly, it doesn't bother me. So yes, I'm definitely sticking with this one! If you're like me and not a fan of mascara, give this one a try! You might end up loving it!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Transfers badly,25 Aug 2023,lovefelix,"I wanted to love this and just ended up really disappointed. It wasn't fantastic at thickening, lengthening, or volumizing, but my biggest complaint is that I ended up with raccoon eyes after less than two hours. I've tried this a few different times and have not successfully found a way to prevent it from transferring around my eye area. Really disappointed.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,24 Aug 2023,jj1522,I like how buildable this mascara is! I definitely notice a difference in the length & volume of my lashes when using! My only con is that it seemed to smudge a lot quicker than other mascaras I've worn that aren't waterproof.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Everyday use!,24 Aug 2023,Enciniao,The Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara is my go to everyday mascara! Not only does the mascara separate my lashes nicely and evenly. The mascara also gives my lashes volume and thickness. Literally only look me about a minute to put the coat of mascara on. The mascara is a nice dark black tint.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new go-to mascara!,24 Aug 2023,NickyB510,This is my new go-to mascara! Very buildable and makes my natural lashes look so full and thick. The wand makes the product very simple to apply and build coverage. I typically only apply a coat underneath and on top of my lashes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I love this mascara!!,24 Aug 2023,kami90210,"After using this mascara over the past two weeks, I have really grown to love this mascara, and it’s one of my favorites. Now I like that it’s buildable. It increases volume and length and really makes my lashes pop I think the only con is that it slightly smudges a bit but that is not every time I use it, so I’m trying to figure out what causes that either way I highly recommend !! I received this product in exchange for a review. all opinions are my own.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Best Mascara I’ve Ever Used!,24 Aug 2023,brownbeauty06,"Finding a mascara that truly gives my eyelashes volume is hard to find. I’ve tried many different brands over the years and never found exactly what I needed. Fenty has done it! Hella Thicc absolutely deserves its name because it gives a lot of thickness and volume, while still looking natural.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s not the best but I like it,24 Aug 2023,RessaL,"The packaging is super slick i love the look of it and the slight tapering of the applicator makes it easy to get the little hairs in the corners. However, it holds on to so much product that you get “spider leg” lashes with one coat. Some people like that look, me personally, i don’t like it too much. Despite that it lasted a long time during my 13hr bartending/hosting shift so thats a plus.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing,24 Aug 2023,Lyricalchy,"I love this mascara! My lashes look amazing and voluminous. In the photo, I have 2 coats on the left eye and none on the right eye!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not Rihanna’s best product.,24 Aug 2023,TrixHTX,It definitely volumizing but the brush is harsh. Doesn’t give me the best look. I wish the bristles were softer and spread apart more.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Didn’t flake does add thickness,24 Aug 2023,lyssalaane,"I got a chance to try this mascara out. This is my first I think Fenty mascara and I was excited. I can say that it did take my lashes. I didn’t notice too much length I do already have long eyelashes, but it did taken them up which is nice so when I would put like falsies on, it, just made it a little bit more flared, and I also put them on my falsies as well and then they made my falsies even like bigger, and gave more attention to them which I like that as well.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Seemed really clumpy, didn't last long",24 Aug 2023,Sarah12338,Not as great as I was hoping. It seems to go on clumpy and definitely not as even as I would expect a Fenty product to be. I was allowed to test this product by Bzzagent complimentary and wasn't really impressed by it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,24 Aug 2023,leleshka,I loved this mascara. I honestly am having hard time to find great mascara because of my Asian lashes always look down. But this mascara makes them look thick and full. It didn’t leave any spots around while I was wearing it for a day. So highly recommend!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Thicc but aint it for me!,24 Aug 2023,KarlaNJ,"Thank you Fenty Beauty for supplying me with a free sample! Overall, I think it's a decent mascara and great for someone looking to add volume to the base of their lashes with an intense, truly black color. 

Personally, though, I prefer a mascara that separates my lashes and provides length which is why I'm giving it 3/5 stars. I'd give a 3.5/4 but also don't love the packaging, it's light-weight and feels a bit cheap. The bristles also feel like they might get clumpy with time.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Pretty good mascara,23 Aug 2023,breedanielz,I like it a lot! Formula is nice. Doesn’t get really clumpy and gets the job done. I don’t really have anything bad to say about it and I would recommend it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Loved the glide and the separation,23 Aug 2023,brisfunbag,"I loved how easy this product was to use, little to no irritation on my eyes, minimal drying time and no crumbles!!! I typically worry about crumbs falling in my eyes because of my contacts but it lasted all day, i had no issues. Perfect formula and the bristles make it so easy to separate",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,23 Aug 2023,,"I love this mascara. It leaves my lashes lengthened, defined and voluminous without being clumpy or flaking. The brush wand is easy to hold and apply the mascara precisely and evenly. My eyes can be sensitive to some mascaras but I didn't experience any issues with Hella Thick.  This wears all day without flaking or running under my eyes, even in hot, humid weather.. Thanks to Fenty for sending me this mascara complimentary to try out in exchange for my honest review.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,23 Aug 2023,keuana,"I recently tried out the Fenty Beauty 'Hella Thick' Moisturizing Mascara, and I must say, it did wonders for my eyes. As someone who already has bold eyes, I was looking for that extra pop to elevate my look, and this mascara delivered just that. Not only did it enhance the volume of my lashes, but it also provided a moisturizing effect that prevented clumping and flaking throughout the day. I found that the formula worked harmoniously with my bold eyes, giving me the dramatic effect I was aiming for. If you're seeking a mascara that adds volume, hydration, and that extra pop, the 'Hella Thick' Moisturizing Mascara from Fenty Beauty is definitely worth considering.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,22 Aug 2023,KriyaG,I liked that the it gives instant volume and length but the brush is so harsh to use. In comparison to other brands the formula is thick but not waterproof which makes it feels little dry over the time. Since it is not waterproof it is easy to remove without hurting your eye lashes hard.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Now apart of my basic beat,22 Aug 2023,EsthieEmpress,"One of my new favs. I don’t have to worry about that thick chalky build-up after my day/night out, it glides off when I’m ready! I’m not a strip lash girl and this mascara gives the natural long lash affect. I would definitely buy this to keep in my regimen.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must have,22 Aug 2023,cindysupe,This is probably my new favorite mascara because you dont need to layer on a bunch of coats to get that thick look. I have TINY lashes and with this on i can actually see my lashes in pictures.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My New Favorite Mascara,22 Aug 2023,LadyHeresy,"The Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara from Fenty Beauty is simply amazing. I have naturally long eyelashes with zero curl to them. In fact, my eyelashes are stubbornly straight. Usually, I can curl them with an eyelash curler, apply mascara, and they will be absolutely flat again within fifteen minutes. I have had some success with one previous mascara adding some curl to them, but it was nothing like the results from the Hella Thicc mascara. This mascara not only gave the appearance of thicker lashes,  but it added a beautiful, full curl to my lashes. Even more impressive is the fact that my lashes stay curled. The formula of this mascara is absolutely beautiful. This mascara goes on easily and smoothly. There is zero clumping even with multiple coats applied. The brush is simple, yet effective and catches even the smallest of lashes. Overall, I highly recommend giving this mascara a try!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
GOAT MASCARA,22 Aug 2023,Tiffany1991,"Easily crawled up to be my numero uno. One coat gets the job done. Two, you’re just showing awfffffff lol. It’s inexpensive but also worth every penny. I’m on my 4th tube… Fenty just always get it right.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
If you like thick mascara,22 Aug 2023,DizChickNina,"Hella thicc is literally “Hella Thicc” so it can clump easy. But I did like how it looked on and layered nicely, I have sparse short lashes. And it did elongate them. I didn’t notice any flaking after application. I did receive this for my HONEST review.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,22 Aug 2023,AlimaB,"I have been using this product lately and I a completely in love. It doesn't clump together or anything, very great product",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Disappointed,21 Aug 2023,MayraMunster,"The things I did like were that it was volumizing and bold. What I didn’t like is the brush wasn’t my favorite; I found that the mascara clumped easily and the brush was bulky. By the end of the day, the mascara had dried off and fallen in little pieces on my cheek. The mascara also smudged under my eyes. I have dry skin so that’s typically something I never have happen with anything around my eyes. Overall pretty disappointing. I did receive this product for free in exchange for writing a review. All opinions are my own.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Very nice,21 Aug 2023,sabraliz,I received a free sample of this product and I enjoyed it! I love most products I’ve tried by Fenty and this is no exception. It doesn’t smell weird and makes my pathetic lashes pop!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

There are other mascaras on the market,21 Aug 2023,poowusu,This was a bit dry and clumpy. It crumbles to the touch and the overall quality isn’t what I’m used to from fenty. It does have a nice lengthening factor but that doesn’t outweigh the other cons for me.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,21 Aug 2023,xmarie411x,First it's a great at volumizing the lash's but it's just not for me. I have thin lashes and it just makes my thin lashes long but that's about it but this definitely is waterproof which is a plus,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Rih you need a waterproof version I’m depressed.,21 Aug 2023,MimiWilletts,"Rih wasn’t thinking about us girlies who cry during our lunch breaks with this one. Shmear central. Also it gets oddly dry sooooo fast. I do like the brush, it’s a real nice one.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
This will make your eyes stunning! 💕,21 Aug 2023,BabyJay1994,First off I received this product from Bzzagent. 🐝This mascara is awesome and  I love how black it is.

,20 Aug 2023,Jassybb11,So I have small lashes to begin with and haven't had much luck with mascaras. This mascara added so much length I was very surprised. I love how it didn't clump while applying. I also really like the brush applicator I think that is was adds volume and length.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love the wand!!,20 Aug 2023,JoJoGlam,This is one of energy best mascara wands that I’ve used for separation. The formula is very buildable paired with the wand creating volume and length.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

I’m not a big fan of the product itself because it can be a tad bit heavy but it’s not terrible!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Voluminous mascara,20 Aug 2023,hurahura0908070,"Fenty Beauty's Hella Thick Mascara delivers on its promise of volume and drama. The formula coats lashes generously, adding instant thickness and depth. The brush design ensures even distribution without clumping, and it's easy to layer for a more intense look. The mascara's long-lasting formula stays put throughout the day without smudging or flaking. While it excels in providing volume, it might not offer as much lengthening for those seeking that effect. Overall, if you're after bold, voluminous lashes, the Fenty Beauty Hella Thick Mascara is worth trying",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Transfers terribly,20 Aug 2023,jbh102776,"I’m giving this three stars because the formula is actually fantastic for thickening and lengthening giving volume etc.. However, it transfers terribly to your lid! Awful. I’m Returning.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

"Very good, but not a must have",19 Aug 2023,breeyawna,This mascara does everything I'd want it to; it lengthens and gives volume. It doesn't flake and holds the curl of my lashes. With that being said it isn't anything spectacular and any good mascara would provide those things as well.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Really works, must try",19 Aug 2023,ceeJaaaaaye,"I have sparse short lashes, and after using this mascara, I could see my lashes full and longer.

Lashes look great,18 Aug 2023,kaaawalove,"I love Fenty products!  This comes in a cute package and applies on very dark.   I applied a couple of coats and it made my lashes look much longer and thick.   It wasn't as thick as I was expecting,  but a few more coats will do the trick. 
It clumped a bit,  but I don't mind as long as my lashes look more bold.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella long not hella thicc,18 Aug 2023,lakrissa,I received this free in exchange for my honest review. I love how dark the pigment is however I feel the name is misleading. It’s called hella thicc but I don’t feel like it gave me extra volume. It did however add more length so I feel the name should have been “hella long”. I would def purchase this in the future to make it my weekday mascara.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Carry it everywhere!,18 Aug 2023,gingeralem,The mascara leaves my lashes looking so cute and long. The bristles are thick and can get all of my lashes coated with little effort.

pleasantly surprised,17 Aug 2023,Jodeeann,"My lashes are huge and pretty! I know this mascara doesn't say it's waterproof but it did stay on  for a crazy long time. Be thorough when cleaning up though, it has a serious stick factor. I'm sure that what also makes it so buildable. I received a free sample but I'm a big fan now. I used to wear a certain UD mascara that was thick and made my lashes have presence, this is a perfect replacement.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Bad Smudging Problem,17 Aug 2023,KinseyBaldino,"I was excited when I got this product last week. The price point is perfect and the packaging is stunning. Unfortunately after using this product for a week now, it has smudged so bad under my eyes everyday.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Sadly a flop,17 Aug 2023,beautydivaomg,"I was so sad that this mascara was such a flop. The black shade I got turned grey throughout the day and left me with transfer under and over my hooded eyes. Sadly I wouldn’t recommend to anyone, i retuned it",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

,17 Aug 2023,celycee,"I have been using this mascara for the last week to get my full opinion on it, and honestly I am not a fan of it. I have long lashes and I felt like the mascara just weighed them down even after using a lash curler. I loved that it didn’t clump my lashes and the packaging is so pretty. But definitely not a mascar I would reach back for.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
New addition in my makeup routine,17 Aug 2023,CngBeauty,"This mascara is now one of my favorite products to use on the daily. Once again, Fenty did not disappoint. I love it!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Another Fenty win,15 Aug 2023,Bsaykay,"The packaging is nice and sleek. The actual product has a good weight to it. I used this mascara exclusively for 2 weeks so that I could get a good feel for it. The want separates and lifts the lashes beautifully. I was amazed on how much fuller my lashes looked. The only downside I noticed is that it is very wet so you have to be careful not to smear it all over your eyes. Overall, I would recommend if you want your lashes to look thicker and fuller.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great option for volume and length,15 Aug 2023,magnoliamalinda,"The brush creates length and volume. The formula is a little too think for the first few uses, but after the first initial uses it creates an even fuller look.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara - Unveil Your Bolde,15 Aug 2023,leeachille,"The Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara is an absolute game-changer when it comes to achieving luscious, voluminous lashes that demand attention. From the moment I tried it, I was impressed by its ability t
o deliver a dramatic lash transformation without any clumping or heaviness.

One of the standout features of this mascara is its unique formula. It effortlessly coats each lash from root to tip, adding impressive volume that gives the illusion of fuller lashes. The mascara's wand is thoughtfully designed, with densely packed bristles that grab onto every lash, ensuring even distribution and avoiding any unsightly clumps.

I was thrilled to find that the Hella Thicc Mascara didn't flake or smudge throughout the day, maintaining its bold effect from morning to night. Whether I was attending a busy workday or a fun night out, my lashes remained voluminous and eye-catching.

Another noteworthy aspect is the deep black color the mascara offers. It adds an intense richness to my lashes, framing my eyes beautifully and enhancing their natural depth.

While the mascara provides impressive volume, it's also versatile. For a more natural look, a single coat works wonders, while applying an extra layer or two offers a striking, high-impact effect that's perfect for special occasions or when you want to make a statement.

In terms of removal, the mascara was surprisingly easy to take off with my regular makeup remover. It didn't require excessive rubbing or tugging, which is a big plus for maintaining healthy lashes.

Overall, the Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara lives up to its name. If you're on the hunt for a mascara that delivers remarkable volume, a deep black color, and lasting performance, this one is definitely worth adding to your makeup collection.

Flexible,15 Aug 2023,sadaffyduckk,This mascara is a great lengthening mascara while giving a good amount of volume.

good not great,14 Aug 2023,CeciliaElise,"i received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I definitely got some volume with this mascara but with the volume came some major clumping, that’s probably because i put a good
 amount of trying to get a little bit of length goin. i think this is better suited for someone that has naturally long lashes and just needs the volume. it was however long lasting. I wore it for a whole 12 at universal studios and through the sweat, spf & water splashed on my face it never budged. no flaking either which is a plus for me!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Delivering Long Lasting Impact!,14 Aug 2023,TTankou,"I'm excited to share my experience with Fenty's Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara, a game-changer that left me in awe of its long-lasting power and stunning effects.  Fenty's Hella Thicc mascara has truly won me over and is now a part of my makeup routine.

I put it to the ultimate test – a full day of wear followed by a shower – and the results were remarkable. The mascara held its ground, refusing to budge even in the face of water. While it doesn't boast waterproof claims, its performance suggests otherwise, making it a reliable choice for all-day events or any situation that demands longevity.

I have my trusty go-to mascara, and I'll admit, I was initially skeptical about whether Fenty's Hella Thicc could measure up. However, the moment I applied it, I was taken aback by its transformative impact. It not only lived up to my expectations but exceeded them in ways I hadn't anticipated. It's a humbling reminder that beauty innovations can indeed surprise and delight

No clump mascara!,14 Aug 2023,b214,First of all i love the packaging and the mascara wand. I like how skinny the wand is and it makes it easier to glide and lift the lashes thoroughly. It definitely lifted my lashes and gave them length. I did not get any clumpy lashes as well which is great. But i do not feel it gave them much volume. Which is why i took one star off. But overall very good mascara and do plan to wear again :),Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Sooo good!,14 Aug 2023,UltraTideMama,"This mascara was fantastic! It required very little Maitenence once applied, I did separate my lashes because that’s just what I do but it wasn’t entirely necessary. Lasted all night for me. 

Only downfall is even with makeup remover I still had black residue under my eyes but definitely not a deal breaker!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

I received this product from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
long lasting thick lashes,14 Aug 2023,glittersgold,"i really like this mascara because it doesnt take too many layers to build the volume on your lashes. i found that for me, no more than two layers was needed. i like the slimmer spoolie, it definitely helped for a more accurate application. the mascara itself was long-lasting, but not hard to wash off at the end of the day.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must have!,14 Aug 2023,yideee,One of the best mascaras I’ve used! It’s not flaky and comes off easy at night!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good enough but not the best,14 Aug 2023,chelseacat89,"I received this complimentary from Fenty Beauty and BzzAgent. I like this mascara. It’s extra black and very voluminous like it says.

Great mascara for everyday! Love it!,14 Aug 2023,Mariah88888,"Loved this mascara!

Overall, the mascara was pretty good.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

it’s alright but expensive,13 Aug 2023,oli123,honestly it’s rlly thick but if u have already thick eyelashes it looks clumpy. i would 100% recommend to people with thin or less lashes. it also ends up on ur under eyes by the end of the day.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Disappointed,13 Aug 2023,ramey1118,"This mascara looks great on but by lunch, the transfer I get under my eyes is horrible.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love this mascara!,13 Aug 2023,Mittens21,Probably one of the best mascaras I have ever used. It legit made my lashes super long. My only issue is that it doesn’t seem like there is a lot of product inside the tube. Would definitely recommend this if your looking for length!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Pleasantly Surprised,12 Aug 2023,ModernMama1979,I have tried so many different mascaras. I'm pleasantly surprised by this one.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Passed the all day wear test!,12 Aug 2023,Dayzmay12,"I wore this all week long and I felt like it definitely did the trick to lengthen my lashes and give that falsie effect. I did notice that after curling my lashes it weighed them down a bit. Overall I wish this was in a waterproof formula as I have had better luck with waterproof mascaras keeping my lash curl. I found the formula to be a good consistency upon first pass after that it does kinda clump together. Overalls, I don't know that I would go out of my way to purchase this product in the future.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
False Lash Effect,12 Aug 2023,Armanijones73,This is a great mascara. It volumizes like it says and make your lashes look like falsies. The packaging is sleek and elegant. This brush is thin with long bristles which is my favorite because it catches every little hair even the bottom lash line. It does not come off easily but it also does not say waterproof. Great long lasting power.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It works,12 Aug 2023,Diamondashanti1,"I don’t wear falsies, so I usually put some mascara on different kinds actually for the lawyer in effect and I found this nice system that I can put on top as a builder for the look that I’m going for",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I would purchase again!,12 Aug 2023,BrittP5,"I’ve used this for a few days. I like it, I’m pretty picky about mascara and once I find one I stick to it.

,11 Aug 2023,unabz,"Its rich black pigment instantly enhanced my lashes, giving them both length and volume. The application was smooth and clump-free, creating a natural yet dramatic look. What truly impressed me was its long-lasting formula that stayed put throughout the day without smudging.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not very buildable,11 Aug 2023,CandidCosmo,This mascara does a great job at lengthening and separating your lashes. I think the wand is really user friendly and not overly bulky/fat. I particularly like this mascara for my lower lashes. The mascara is too tacky for my liking and not very buildable. This isn’t worth the price for me.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love it,11 Aug 2023,OluwatomiL,"This Mascara does the trick. Color is dark black, which I wanted. It goes on well, and with a couple of strokes, eyelashes are long, thick and curled.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not for me,11 Aug 2023,Selina32,"I received this as from bzzzagent to sample. I don't think this mascara is for me.  My lashes are very fine and straight. They are pretty sparse. I found this mascara too heavy and the brush too thick, but at the same time I didn't feel like this mascara had much of an impact for the price. The brush smudged on my lashes and it just made my lashes look thin and kinda clumpy. I've had much better results from drugstore mascaras for less than half the price.   It might work better on thicker currier lashes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Pretty great,11 Aug 2023,theradlifeofjes,It’s definitely thick!! Lol I use a few coats then I brush it out with an old mascara brush to get the clumps out. Other than that it’s a great consistent mascara and I have used two tubes of it!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Extended my eyelashes significantly,11 Aug 2023,dading,"The design of the mascara tube is good-looking,especially the bottom. The mascara liquid is thick, and is easily applied on both upper and lower eyelashes. It makes my eyelashes much longer and thick.

Best so far,10 Aug 2023,DivaBbyrd,Love how this mascara elongates my eyelashes. Love this product!!!!!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Add It To Your fave’s,10 Aug 2023,frenchyyy0602,"This mascara is amazing, no clumps, super lightweight, and the volume it gives is impressive to say the least!! This over lashes !! (sometimes)",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Thick voluptuous lashes!,10 Aug 2023,DarylR,This is definitely a thickening mascara. I have sparse lashes and this mascara made them thicker and fuller. The wand gives very precise application. After few hours it began to smudge a little bit. I have sensitive eyes and this caused no burning or any other irritation.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

ride or die mascara,10 Aug 2023,susantanner,"I bought this product when it first came out and let me tell you, it made my lashes HELLA thicc. it lengthens my lashes while also making them look very full, which gives the false lash effect.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Smudgy and clumpy,9 Aug 2023,Skysailor8,"I like the packaging and the brush is decent, but I found the product itself to be clumpy and not super flattering on my lashes. Just not my preferred look. I also have oily lids so it smudged in a just a few hours, giving me panda eyes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A new addition to my makeup routine,9 Aug 2023,ttbun,"I’m actually taken aback!! This mascara claims to be volumizing and thick and it iss!!

I mean it’s good … but it’s not top 5,9 Aug 2023,richgirllexy,"I really wanted to love this but I used the product without an eye lash primer I naturally have lashes and rarely use strip lashes so I’m always looking for the best mascara , off initial impact packaging great and sleek I was hoping it would be a wet kind of mascara but it’s more on the dry side it work I can see the difference from the other eye but it’s nothing that I would say I would buy over and over again",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Decent product,9 Aug 2023,chloehjang,Very buildable mascara. My only complaint is that it smudges really easily after an hour or so on the eyes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Nice!,9 Aug 2023,LilacBeautyx33,"This mascara definitely was named right! It did give my lashes volume, and helped them pop! For me, I didn't experience flaking or smudging. I did find that this mascara was a bit clumpy even with just one layer applied though. Overall, I would give this mascara a 4/5. With a little bit of “work” and lash primer, I believe this could be a great mascara to keep in rotation depending on the look someone is going for.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

It is okay,9 Aug 2023,sodadadadada,"I do like how it extends my lashes and maybe even curls them a little bit? What I don’t like is that it’s not all natural. I have used all natural products for the last seven or eight years, but have been unhappy with my mascara options. I went against what I normally do and bought this and it works really well. I just wish that I could find one that works. Well that is also more natural! I don’t normally wear makeup other than eyeliner and perhaps a tinted lip balm. Hope this helps.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Great product!!,9 Aug 2023,theshannonleej,Cool results! Lashes are volumized! Dope product. Overall everyone should support!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A meh,9 Aug 2023,Elibeth507,After using this product for a week I don’t really like it because it weighs down my lashes I have short and small lashes and it weights it down so it won’t hold a curl. But when I use the mascara I normally use it holds the curl and makes it look much longer and voluminous! I would only recommend this if you have lashes that are curly naturally and thick.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must Have in you collection,9 Aug 2023,SlayGodShay,I love this! I love how black it is! It’s so rich and pigmented! It gives the lift that I was lookin for without being clumpy,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Worth another shot!,9 Aug 2023,PrettyGirlT205,"I love most fenty products, but this isn't my favorite. It is fairly clumpy. After 1 layer it gets clumpy and I am not a fan of that. The wand is wonderfully made, however the formula needs a little more improvement. If that was fixed I would definitely buy again.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A must -have for me,9 Aug 2023,Janejoey,"This mascara truly adds volume and length to lashes without clumping or smudging. It came with an applicator which makes it a lot easier to  coat your lash lines.
The wear time is excellent ( I wore it for 12hours and it didn’t smear).

Another thing I love about this mascara is how dark it is, it gave me a  striking bold look which is very unusual with some mascaras I have tried.(like I wore false lashes.)
All in all , this product is amazing and I will rate it⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,9 Aug 2023,xoec,I love the volume of this mascara and appreciate that there aren’t any clumps.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A little sweat and your done for,9 Aug 2023,ReddestWine,"It’s not water proof and in this heat where I live the sweat didn’t help this mascara, it ran under my eyes like it was getting robbed. My lashes are already long so all it did was just make them dark. At first the Mascra made them pretty and I liked it . But with time they looked horrible. I only use water proof mascara because of the climate I'm in. A good mascara which is true and true is the Lancôme one. Unfortunately I can't switch up my main for this.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Perfect for those lashes we crave,9 Aug 2023,gudgurldone,"Hella impressed with Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara by Fenty Beauty. To me, it starts with the applicator tip, and Hella Thicc has the perfect tip for holding and applying the mascara to each and every lash - flawlessly. Rich, smooth mascara is fantastic.

Good for beginners,9 Aug 2023,MegumiK,I'm not a big mascara user since I don't like the feeling of stuff on my lashes but this one was pretty good! Application was easy and it didn't clump. My only issue is slight smudging but I might have over applied it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
New mascara staple,9 Aug 2023,Helenc5,Absolutely love this Fenty Mascara. It creates a ton of volume while still looking seamless. I personally use an eyelash primer with it so it goes on so smoothly doesn't clump at all and lasts all day.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Another Great Fenty Product!,8 Aug 2023,Fuego56743267,"Note: I received this item complimentary in exchange for my review. However, this review reflects my true opinion.

I currently have several Fenty items that I love and use as apart of my go to makeup routine, so I was very excited to try the new Fenty Hella Thicc Mascara! This mascara gave my lashes volume and length without being clumpy or heavy. The effect of the mascara was very natural looking and definitely gave my eyes a little bit of pop.

For application, I brushed my lashes with a clean spoolie, applied 1 coat of mascara, and then brushed through again with a clean spoolie. 

Other reviewers noted that the mascara flaked/smudged. I didn’t experience any flaking or smudging, but I only used a light coat and was not sweating or anything like that. 

Overall, would recommend!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
This is a must have for everyone’s makeup!,8 Aug 2023,dinesty,"The pass few weeks trying this new product have turned out better then I expected, this fenty beauty mascara is the best mascara that I have ever tried. And yes, she is hella thick!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Smudges everywhere,3 Aug 2023,RacqtheBelle,"This mascara smudges under my eyes and leaves dark circles no matter the weather. It does make my lashes look thicker, but the way it smudges, it makes me look exhausted. Not worth the money at all.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Meh,30 Jul 2023,3343,This mascara makes my lashes look full . However it is impossible to get off . I use about 3 different makeup removers just to get this off . My eye area is too sensitive for that . I prefer the rare beauty one overall.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
This product is named perfectly,29 Jul 2023,CooperE,I have purchased this mascara twice over the past several months and I am in love! I love how black it makes my lashes and gives a false lash effect. I can see myself repurchasing this mascara over and over!!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Looks like lash extensions,27 Jul 2023,AFoodie,"I don’t usually wear makeup at work. Occasionally I’ll do some mascara and some lip gloss. I bought this based on a recommendation from a Sephora employee and some of the ladies at work asked if I had gotten lash extensions. It’s incredibly thick and volumizing and it does look like lash extensions when I put it on. The only downside for me is that I can actually see my lashes in my peripheral because the product is so thick. I have not experienced any smudging so far after wearing for 3 days at work but I also haven’t been sweating heavily or anything. It does flake off a tiny bit (found 2 tiny flecks on my cheek one day). Easy to take off, don’t have to apply a lot. I think this is my new favorite and im giving up maybelline.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not worth the money,27 Jul 2023,BeccaW88,I’m trying so hard to like this mascara but it ain’t it. I curl my lashes and apply a light coat of Hella Thicc and it causes my lashes to drop and go back to being straight. First pic is Hella Thicc and second pic is Maybelline. The volumizing isn’t anything so anything special either. I’ll stick with my colossal curl bounce mascara from Maybelline. Save the money,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good volume!,27 Jul 2023,sfsuperstar,It goes on clumpy but better with a mascara primer. I used the Lancôme mascara primer with it. Gives good volume definitely and I have no issues with it flaking or not lasting. I will probably repurchase.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Just meh……,27 Jul 2023,Allimmk,Not good. Not bad. Just below average at a higher cost. My lashes are pretty good and this didn’t really do much for them. Just made them look darker and weighed them down.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Love it but so disappointing!,20 Jul 2023,beautguru17,"I absolutely love this mascara! It lifts and creates the fake lash look..however it smudges so bad!!

Tried to love but no,15 Jul 2023,lbakos,"I am always looking for a great mascara since Sephora stopped making their Outrageous Volume mascara. I was really looking forward to Hella Thicc. I tried hard to love this, but unfortunately I ended up returning it. No matter what I did, after about 2 hours, I had a raccoon type look going on. The mascara would bleed onto my eyelids just under my eyebrows. Completely unacceptable as this made me look ridiculous",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Another win for Rih,6 Jul 2023,Oluboom,"I was really skeptical because of the reviews I read about smudging and smearing but I didn't experience that with this product. So far I absolutely love it. My favorite part is it doesn't dry hard. ALL the other mascaras I've used like Better than sex, Bad gyal Bang, Roller lash ... you name it , they ALL make my lashes crispy and they're so hard to remove with makeup wipes but this dries so softly and wipes off with the wipes. I absolutely love that part and for THAT reason this will be my new go to.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Disappointing,6 Jul 2023,justbeachy18,"So disappointed, it smudges.  I had high hopes because Fenty is a quality brand but another disappointing mascara, why did Makeup Forever discontinue Excessive lash??",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

No for me,30 Jun 2023,Sandymanky,"It was clumsy, clumpy and feathers all over the cheeks and under eyes. Returned. A regular drugstore mascara does a better job I guess",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Eh it’s okay,29 Jun 2023,MackieB,"I love how it applies but it does come out very thick so you have to be careful not to get it on your lids or under eyes when applying.

May need a formula revamp",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,29 Jun 2023,carlystarrr,the formula itself is very watery. it smudged really easy and was on my eyelids but i do have shakey hands. It did hold my lashes though and the curl was solid,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It's a Miss for Me,28 Jun 2023,KaliKennda,"This was so disappointing. The formula is very thin, and did not volumize, or pack a punch. I ended up having to layer it like I would bare lashes. :/",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
An unfortunate miss...,27 Jun 2023,Debi9757,"I love Fenty, but this product is not a fave.  Love the application and how it makes my lashes look at first.  However, by the end of the day, I look like a raccoon with the smudging under eyes.

Save your money or time.,27 Jun 2023,henlopeoples,"Very goopy formula inside the tube, have to scrap the wand off on the tube to avoid huge blobs of product on lashes. Clumps to the extreme and never looks good, no matter what techniques I try. I have very long lashes that end up looking like falsies with a good mascara, this makes my lashes fall flat and stick together. Smears and flakes like crazy, especially with the fenty eye cream, so much so that after a couple of hours of wear, I’m asked if I have been crying.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love this!,27 Jun 2023,stanze,"I received a sample of this. I keep reaching for it instead of my regular mascara. I finally purchased a full size. I have long eyelashes, but this makes them look thick and long without looking clumpy and tons of mascara. I use 2 coats and they are thick and long. It doesn’t flake or smudge. I usually use a primer under and it looks great. There are times when I just use one coat and no curler, no primer and they still look long and full. A really good mascara.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

You better stick with the drugstore mascara,24 Jun 2023,CatalinaGC,"It’s a NO for me … I normally have long lashes, but straight, so the lash curler is my best friend.

DONT BUY,23 Jun 2023,sheislovingit,"Super clumpy and my eyelashes aren’t even thick, they’re just long. I tried to take off as much of the product off the wand before applying and it was extremely clumpy and it weighed my lashes down.

Instant length and volume 🖤,21 Jun 2023,CookieWu,I just purchased this bc of Rihanna’s recent Tiktok video & I immediately tried it in the car.

,6 Jun 2023,the1337beauty,"Hella Thicc is an appropriate name because this mascara will definitely make you lashes THICK!!! From that perspective it’s amazing. But unfortunately I get more flaking with this mascara than I have with any others. I struggle to wear contacts with this mascara because it flakes into my eyes so bad. It also doesn’t seem to hold curl well, by the end of the day my lashes are flat. It’s alright but I wouldn’t repurchase it, I’ve got other mascaras that work better for me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Definelty a miss on this one Rih Rih,6 Jun 2023,WhereAllQueens,"Ok I’m a super fenty fan…but this not the one….is smears , it smudges , it takes way to long to dry. And it’s just way to thick, but if you do have super long lashes naturally than it might work for you.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
“Omg are those your real lashes?!”,6 Jun 2023,Megaan77,"This mascara is my favourite out of any mascara I’ve tried. I don’t know if it would be good for people with short lashes, as it is quite thick and clumpy, but with longer lashes, the product spreads out pretty well. I constantly get comments about my eyelashes being so long when I wear this mascara. A few cons (not real breakers): it’s chunky and messy, the wand holds a lot of product at the end, it runs if you don’t let it dry well, expensive. If you’re curious about buying this, I’d suggest giving it a try! It works well for me",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

good combo,26 May 2023,markiebabey,the trick to this is to use THIN layers. do not clump on and work slowly! its not waterproof but i seal it in with calirary come hell or high water which keeps lashes up. best combo for my sparse but long lashes!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
So bad I had to review,24 May 2023,jacksrealtea,One of the cheaper mascaras I decided to buy it. ($19 compared to around $30) I have naturally long eyelashes but I can use some volume but this mascara is so clumpy and flakey! The “volume” is gone once it’s starts flaking obviously because it’s gone with the wind lol. I’m returning and getting else. I’m a huge fan but not a liar.  Oh yeah and it smudges as shown in the picture,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not transfer or sweat proof but the volume tho,24 May 2023,vitmar,I’m actually soooo sad that this did not live up to the sweat proof and transfer proof hype. Because the volume is unreal. But it was all over my lids and under eyes and it wasn’t that hot. I have deep set eyes so I can only use tubing mascara but I was eager to try this. Sadly I’ll be returning it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not too shabby,24 May 2023,breeziie,"All in all this is a great mascara, it's very dark and it makes my lashes look amazing. My only complaint about this is that you have to let it absolutely dry in order for you to do anything else. If you want to build you have to let it completely dry. I forgot to put liner in my waterline and I just figured I'd do it super quick after using this on bottom lashes, wrong, it humbled me real quick. I would buy it again. Definitely not a good buy if you are always in a rush.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Rihanna can do no wrong,24 May 2023,holapaulina,"Immediately after applying the first coat, the difference was INSANE! My lashes are long, but not dark and this mascara made them pop! Officially my new favorite and I have told all my friends about it.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

You just need one coat!,23 May 2023,Karlaifj,"I got the sample from the Beauty offers and it didnt disappoint, I also got the ilia and rare beauty mini sizes and Fenty was by faaaar my favorite, I just apply one coat and has a better effect even if you don’t use a curler I’ll be getting the full size soon too",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good lengthening mascara but…,22 May 2023,sforafan,Great at lengthening but a wet mascara that leaves residue on your upper and lower lids.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,22 May 2023,Poobear97,The brush is nothing fancy but my lashes were super big. No clumping,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Very voluminous.,21 May 2023,RoofaToofa,Very pretty and definitely lengthening. Would but again.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,20 May 2023,Melh11,"This mascara does not bring any volume to my lashes, but weighs them down, making my eyes looks smaller. An eyelash curler does not correct this. Save your money",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Best yet,19 May 2023,CrzyTina,I’ve always thought that Lancome had the best mascara until I tried this one. This is my new fave. Highly recommended.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Great Mascara except….,17 May 2023,Sara2424,I love this mascara overall there’s just one problem. If you get it on your skin it doesn’t flake off once it dries like most mascaras. It smudges and ruins your makeup. Just gotta be careful during application!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Do not use this on your bottom lashes,17 May 2023,lessjen,I wanted to love this so much but sadly if you put any of the mascara on your Barton lashes or if you get oily or sweaty around your eye this product smudges like crazy. I really do love how it makes my lashes look but I have to really powder my eye area to avoid the smudge,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
This is amazing!,17 May 2023,coolpersonx,"So the mascara is actually thic, not just that but it is also voluminizing! The wand is promising too, cause you can see it's thic, new favorite mascara, loveeee it!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Wish it was better,17 May 2023,newnew2021,Was really excited about this new mascara which says it’s not transfer resistant but unfortunately it transferred onto my eyelids in a couple of hours. Doesn’t really work well if you try to build volume just makes it look like spider legs. B,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
meh.,16 May 2023,katyajones,"TBH- this is a great mascara. volume for days, however, if you’re like me and also put mascara on ur bottom lashes, DONT DO IT W THIS MASCARA!! y’all it made my eyes look like i went to a german club 😭 not worth buying again.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Becoming my Go To,15 May 2023,nataline123,"Saie mascara js my “clean” daily choice but I’m starting to reach for this more now! It does everything I need w two swipes: no clump, no smudge,  gives volume, lift,length and comes off easily",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Game changer for my lashes,14 May 2023,Rileybrat9,"I love it! With my aging light thinner eye lashes this makes them long and gorgeous. It’s a little tricky to remove, and you have to be careful putting it on until you get used to it, start with a light touch to avoid getting messy",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,14 May 2023,itisher,"The mascara is really good, it is not hard to take off",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must try,14 May 2023,ShayJB,My new favorite! Fenty can do no wrong but Rihanna knocked it out of the park with this one.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Good (but heavy) formula, TERRIBLE wiper.",13 May 2023,micheleartist,"Definitely dramatic formula and when you work with it you get great thick, long lashes.  It's a heavy formula so if you don't curly your lashes repeatedly, they will fall flat.  Also, while the brush is good, the wiper is crap.  It leaves wayyyyy too much product on the wand.  Like, blobs of it, which results in super clumpy application.  Thin coats are where it's at to build volume.  If I have to wipe the wand to get it to apply properly, it's a waste of product and too much work IMO.  I want to apply my mascara, comb through to separate and be done.   If they fix the wiper system to remove excess from the wand as it comes out of the tube, I may revisit.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not impressed,13 May 2023,moxxie23,"This was terrible for my short, straight eyelashes. It was a messy clumpy mess to apply, and as soon as it dries it flakes all over your face. I’m honestly so surprised by all the rave reviews. I’ve tried almost every mascara sold at Sephora, and this by far is the worst.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Best mascara ever.,12 May 2023,marcatt,This is one of the best mascaras I've ever used. It makes my lashes look long and full and it's not clumpy. Definitely recommend.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,12 May 2023,Minervsss,I was so excited for this but yeah no. It’s smudges too much. Horrible raccoon eyes with it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s a no from me,12 May 2023,dancinggrace,"This mascara makes me so upset. I loved it for the first week or so. It looked amazing and I hardly had any issues. After that, the flaking started. I get so many flakes in my eyes when I wear it. The last two times I’ve worn it, I had the worst raccoon eyes. I was horrified when I looked in the mirror at lunch and saw just how bad it was.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Game changer,7 May 2023,WonderWoman1979,"oh my gosh this mascara is amazing I was using the Full Frontal Volume, Lift & Curl Mascara by Fenty as well just wanted a change. hella Thicc volumizing mascara, amazing! I'm always trying new things both of them are great this one amazing what a game changer smooth goes on easy, great purchase.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,7 May 2023,mdao44,"My lashes just fell flat and straight (Asian lashes). Back to it’s normal state. I did like the brush though, combed through the lashes really well.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A new fave!!!,6 May 2023,TayTech,Love this mascara! I have short lashes and this mascara gives me a lot of length and volume! The only downside is that it has just a little bit of flake but very minimal. Would purchase again!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
WOAH,5 May 2023,shushano,"I have never written a review on a makeup product but this has to be the one. This mascara makes my eyelashes literally look like a doll. People are complaining about smudging but I did not have this problem at all, it didn't even flake and every single mascara I have flakes on me. I've had my mascara on since 6 am and now it's 9 pm, flawless.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Save your money,5 May 2023,BeckyO9,This is absolute garbage.  Clumpy fry crumbly mess.  Save your money.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"volume, length, no clumps & long-lasting",3 May 2023,mbbergs,"First picture is without mascara and second is with !!one!! coat of this mascara.
This is my first non-drugstore mascara and I noticed a difference in volume and length compared to what I normally use (Covergirl). There is a bit of extra product on the tip of the applicator whenever you take it out, but you can easily wipe it off in the bottle before application. I noticed a tiny bit of under-eye smudging after an entire evening out, but not nearly as much as I’d have with other mascaras. I didn’t really notice any clumping and thought it dried quickly :)

This mascara is a really great upgrade if you’re used to drugstore brands, especially for the price! It maybe wouldn’t be the best choice for those who are used to higher-end mascara that does not smudge.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
disappointed,3 May 2023,GerGer96,I was very excited to wear this; but it okay for good 30 minutes than it's running and smudges.  Definitely will stick to a different brand,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Trashed it because of smudging,3 May 2023,Sterling00,"The wand and application are great, but something about the formula has it smudging all throughout the day. I tried it with a primer, without a primer, and no success. I tossed it after a week.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

It’s a no from me,2 May 2023,Julespink45,"I really wanted to love this, but it’s a miss. It’s clumpy and flakes. At first I thought it was because I didn’t set my concealer well, but the next time I wore it the same thing happened. Such a shame…..",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
oh yea,1 May 2023,keif,i’ve been using this for a while now and its now one of my favorite mascaras. makes my tiny lashes look good definitely will be repurchasing !,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

just ok,30 Apr 2023,kport3r,It's OK for the price. Flakes after a few hours and goes on pretty thick.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Meh, it’s alright",30 Apr 2023,LauraExplora,"It’s not bad, but it’s not the best.. you can definitely get a drugstore mascara that is much better. I wanted to love this based off a YouTube recommendation.. but it’s just thick in a bad way, goopy, messy. Save your $ and get L’Oréal lash paradise instead.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Don’t purchase unless you want clumpy lashes,29 Apr 2023,Nicole7916,Worst clumping my mascara! It doesn’t build well. It just clumps and clumps and clumps! I even cleaned off the wand some as it is a wet formula. Only good thing is that it is a blackest black type mascara.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Looks like you have on falsies,27 Apr 2023,insiderasi,I am now obsessed with this mascara ! With one swipe my lashes looked amazing. If your not into clumpy mascara I wouldn’t recommend but if you are definitely add this to your cart!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
really bad transfer,27 Apr 2023,madisonblake,oof I wanted to love this but it's bad. looked great when I first put it on but within 5 minutes it transferred onto my brow bone. maybe if you have short lashes it is OK but if your lashes touch your brow bone this isn't for you. I'll have to return it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,27 Apr 2023,catlady20,"It starts off decent looking… a little clumpy, but a good amount of volume. So any of the good reviews must have been from people immediately after applying 😂 within just a few hours of doing absolutely NOTHING (no sweating, no humidity, no working out - nada!!!) I had the worst raccoon eyes I have ever seen in my life. Seriously, I looked like a raccoon that jumped out of a trash can where this mascara belongs. I couldn’t take this mascara off quick enough, which brings me to the other worst part about this mascara - it’s SO HARD TO REMOVE !!! How it smears so effortlessly yet stubbornly clings to your lashes at the exact same time is pretty impressive… but in the worst way possible.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
YAS!,26 Apr 2023,rxqueen91,"New favorite mascara! Definitely take some getting used to using the brush but worth it. Thanks, RiRi! 💗",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Eeeeerrk Swerve left. Avoid this!,26 Apr 2023,CourtMTB,"No point in the product if it transfers. And it does. Horribly. Running, kicking and screaming back to the new GXVE mascara ✌🏼",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
best mascara ive used,26 Apr 2023,jordee13,over the years I have tried a ton of mascaras.This is by far the best. The wand is sleek and small so you can get every lash. Highly recommend!!!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Smudges galore,26 Apr 2023,amanders,Let me preface this by saying that I’m not especially prone to mascara smudging on me. I try a lot of mascaras and could count on one hand the number of times it’s happened. But this smudges under AND above my eyes really badly. I will be returning.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Too thick?,26 Apr 2023,cafeaubeauty,"I received the Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara for free from Fenty Beauty in exchange for my honest review. 
I have mixed feelings about this mascara. Yes, it makes my lashes really thick and voluminous, but it takes a long time to get it to look good. I appreciate some clumps for more volume, but this mascara looks TOO clumpy at first. With other mascaras, I'm brushing my lashes with the wand to add more product, but with this mascara, the wand adds too much product at once and I'm brushing with the wand to brush out the clumps. But once I finish combing through, my lashes look nice and thick. I also don't like that no matter how careful I try to be, I always end up with product on my eyelids. Ultimately, this mascara smudges onto my under eyes throughout the day.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s a no for me!,25 Apr 2023,vdsmskd,Too heavy and clumpy! Hate the wand and very flaky :(,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Smears everywhere,25 Apr 2023,JillieVac,So disappointed. I love the lip products so I thought I’d try the mascara but it’s awful. It smears everywhere after just a few hours. It wasn’t even hot or humid. I was in an air conditioned room.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Bleeds,25 Apr 2023,Amyyyyy9,"I was excited to try this but unfortunately, throughout the day, it bled onto my upper AND lower eyelids. I think the formula may be too oily or something. I also have a very hard time getting it off with my makeup remover.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Broke my raccoon heart,25 Apr 2023,carolinarios22,I love the brush shape and how much volume it gives your lashes. I really thought this was going to be my perfect mascara but I can’t deal with how much it transfers throughout the day. I felt like a raccoon,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Transfers terribly,25 Apr 2023,linds1,"I loved the way this looked on, but it transferred SO BAD all over my brow bone. Within and hour of wearing it I have black smudged anywhere the tips of my lashes touched. Such a bummer because this looks beautiful on :/",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It's ok,25 Apr 2023,Cecile2906,"I really wanted to love this mascara. It's ok, definitely not a bad one to the point that I'd return it, it's a bit clumpy. I have used other brands that were just as nice or nicer actually.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Disappointing,25 Apr 2023,jcofficial,"Wanted to love it! Disappointed in the formula and the difficulty to remove after double wash and makeup remover, especially since I did not double coat.
It does not lift better than others at Sephora.
And the black is not like Dior or KVD.
FYI: beauty mascara aficionado here, and Sephora VIB since 2009.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Panda eyes,24 Apr 2023,gillian8312001,This mascara gave great volume and length but after a could hours I had panda eyes which is very disappointing for a high end mascara. Won’t be repurchasing,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Wanted to love it but...,24 Apr 2023,NJ95,"True to the description, creates volume and length, but so clumpy!!! Does not work for me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Wanted to love this SO BAD,24 Apr 2023,cmw09,After the First initial application I looooved it! But after wearing it for a couple hours it smudged to my under eye.  It’s definitely not water proof either. The brush is really big and clumpy so it’s hard to really get to the root of the eye lash,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Rihanna did that!!,23 Apr 2023,cmains,"I have a hard time loving mascaras, but this one is excellent. The formula is very wet, so keep that in mind. But I think the more I use it and after it begins to dry out a little it’ll be easier to work with. It separates and volumizes beautifully.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Didn’t help with volume,23 Apr 2023,biby143,Returned for me it was clumpy the brush was also not my favorite,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,23 Apr 2023,QueenVictoria5,"I received a sample and instantly fell in love with it. I am a bit of a snob when it comes to mascara because I only like Lancome ones.

Love how the bottle feels and looks, too!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,22 Apr 2023,GeeMBee,Applies beautifully. Thought I had found my new favourite mascara that tops all others. But it transferred to my skin underneath my eyes after several hours of wearing.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Transfers,22 Apr 2023,SConrad3187,Do not buy this. I have never bought a mascara transfer so much and so fast as this one. I had to take off all my eye makeup and start all over.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Eh..,22 Apr 2023,Milyn09,"It’s an ok product, I’m glad I got to sample it because if I had purchased it I would’ve returned it. It’s an average mascara and it clumps very easily. For 20 bucks might as well go with a drug store brand that does the same",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
newly added to my top mascara list!,22 Apr 2023,kieona,this mascara is a beast! I love the thick look it makes my eyelashes look super plump hence the name. this one is added to my top 5 mascaras and it is not number 2. highly recommend!!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Perfect for voluminous & long fluttering lashes!!,22 Apr 2023,moxiegrrl,"I am impressed!!!  This mascara coats my lashes beautifully!!

Mascara review,21 Apr 2023,lightning0388,"I tried to wear it so many days and different ways but it smudged all over; under my eyes and on my eyelids. Before it rubbed all over, it did give me great looking lashes so maybe if you have short lashes it would work best?",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

I like it,18 Apr 2023,amv49,I was not sure if I would like this because I like lengthening mascaras and hate clumping. This mascara does give a lot of volume and it is also gives length. It can get clumpy with two many coats. I do two coats and it is perfect for me.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Very mediocre mascara with cheap packaging..,16 Apr 2023,Vance27,This is a pretty basic mascara it sorta gets the job done but nothing special and when I used it I’d def didn’t stay on all day it transferred on me big time so it’s claim that it doesn’t budge is simply not true! Also the packaging feels so cheap!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
decent mascara,15 Apr 2023,MaryEIizabeth,not my favorite mascara of all time but it gets the job done.

,14 Apr 2023,ChrissieRose,I am a fan of the Lancôme monsier big. This mascara is pretty similar to that imo but cheaper for the same amount of product. I use on top lashes only. It will give volume more than length,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,14 Apr 2023,magiconchel,This is the only mascara that makes my non existent eyelashes look like I have extensions. I even got asked if they were my real eyelashes!!

No bueno :(,14 Apr 2023,cailarosemartin,"The bottle is too small for the amount of product inside so it oversaturates the wand and makes my lashes goop together and shorten instead of voluminizing. Disappointed, still love FENTY tho.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Raccoon Eyes,14 Apr 2023,stacey1987,"This mascara gave me the absolute worst raccoon eyes a high end mascara has ever given me. I had a ring under my eye, a ring on my lid... mega mega hard pass. So sad, I had high hopes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
This needs to be transfer proof!,14 Apr 2023,GeeMBee,"First impression of this mascara was wow, it applies beautifully and my lashes look so full and long! Immediately fell in love. However, after wearing for maybe 2 hours, it transferred & gave me black smudges around the bottom of my eyes",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A New Favorite,14 Apr 2023,xjessex,"I'm an avid user of Beauty for Real Hi Def mascara, but have become a little annoyed with ordering beauty products from a bunch of different places so I thought I'd give this a try. I've got to say, I'm pleasantly surprised! I don't usually care for a thick brush, but I pushed past that because this mascara gives great length and volume. It's also super black! I have no issues with smudging so far, even with the heat. Definitely a nice mascara.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Disappointed,14 Apr 2023,Colcol1,I really wanted to love this. The length is amazing but it clumps and lumps my lashes together badly and I end up with raccoon eyes half way through the day,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Super pigmented and volumizing!,14 Apr 2023,Mbcombe,I wasn’t sure the first time I used this if I liked the formula but after a few wears I decided it’s definitely going to be a new go to. It’s very black which is great since I have blonde lashes. It also adds tons of volume with just one coat. It does fall on the softer side when dry so your lashes still have some natural movement. It does have a strong scent when first removed from the tube but it doesn’t stay. It removes nicely as well. Overall I’d recommend!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
smudged everywhere,13 Apr 2023,virgo16,"This looked fine when I put it on (definitely NOT crazy volume, but just a decent mascara) but it smudged literally all down my face within the hour. I've never experienced so much smudging, I don't even know how it got down my cheeks! A total mess.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,13 Apr 2023,catlady20,"It gives a decent amount of volume, but it smudges and gives raccoon eyes by the end of the day and it is EXTREMELY hard to remove.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
sky high lashes,13 Apr 2023,LauraGrace9898,this product gave my lashes amazing length and lift! honestly the most lift a mascara has ever given my lashes 🤩,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love it!!!,13 Apr 2023,tinaluvsu22,"I love how this product makes my eyelashes pop. It creates a more bold look, I'm not used to my lashes looking as full as it did when I first started using this product but now I'm obsessed.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing!,13 Apr 2023,Daneen,This is by far my favorite mascara! The formula is creamy and doesn't dry out. It makes my lashes look like I have falsies on. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the shape of the packaging. It can't stand up so you have to lay it down.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s a no,12 Apr 2023,lb174,I have deep set eyes so mascara easily smudges for me and this was one of the worst. It looks amazing for maybe 5 mins and then smudged/flaked everywhere.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Decent,12 Apr 2023,danielacorderoo,"I wanted to love this but it feels a little lower quality than I was expecting. The formula is super smooth and doesn’t clump but other than that it doesn’t do much for my lashes, no curl or volume. I think it’s a fine option but I think there are cheaper alternatives that are similar in quality.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing mascara!!,12 Apr 2023,theMiriam,"I was gifted this product but I would purchase it since it's that good. The consistency is nice and smooth, it doesn't clump up your lashes but rather coats each lash resulting in a visible difference. I naturally have tiny eyelashes but this mascara made it look like I had some false eyelashes on so if you've got longer eyelashes you'll be rocking full-volume lashes!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing mascara!,12 Apr 2023,Corplyn,love this product. It makes my eyelashes look very long and thick even when they really aren’t. It looks like I’m wearing false lashes and I’ve gotten compliments.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Ok if you don’t mind flakes,12 Apr 2023,JaimePanda,I got a mini of this and was excited to try it. It’s just ok. It flakes off on my face during the day. It does give volume but so does any drugstore mascara and you can find ones that don’t flake. If you don’t mind flakes,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Obsessed,12 Apr 2023,curlyredtricia,I got this massacre from the bzzagent for free and I so excited to use. Fenty beauty is my favorite makeup and skincare line. I love how this mascara is bold in color and long lasting,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love this mascara,12 Apr 2023,kayreed92,"This is a really nice and buildable formula. Its very black color gives you nice bold lashes. I really like
This product and will definitely buy this regularly. I like thick lashes and this does great. Fenty beauty has really great products. 
I received a free sample in exchange for this post.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great Looking Mascara Lashes,12 Apr 2023,Glamwithglasses,"The packaging for Fenty is very sleek and solid. The mascara itself is very buildable while adding length and volume to your lashes. I really liked the shape and size of the brush spoolie, it was very easy to apply and build up.  The mascara goes on smooth and doesn't clump together in big clumps, so that was a huge plus for me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes

Must recurl after first coat besides that holds up,11 Apr 2023,Lilyanna23,"It’s a thicker formula than her other mascara and makes my lashes bold. My lashes are pretty straight so when I curl them and apply the first coat, they get weighed down but recurling no issue",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Do not purchase,11 Apr 2023,veronicacoby,"It definitely thickens the lashes however, I noticed this product smudges terribly & so soon! I tried it on various days (with heavy glam, with just the mascara and with less coats) NOPE, definitely pass.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must try,11 Apr 2023,MichelleM8,"I really like this mascara! It goes on smoothly, the brush is easy to hold, and a lot of product comes out on the first try. It adds length & volume. On the first full swipe on my top lashes it looked doubly coated! Would reorder!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Did not last.,11 Apr 2023,kayhunnyv,"Really like the brush and packaging, but even though I set around my under eyes I still got raccoon eyes at the end of the day☹️ and I did notice I lost a lot of product off from my lashes by the end of the night",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It’s great! (just not for me),11 Apr 2023,goldyyylion,"Received as a sample was excited to see what it was about and let me tell you it didn’t disappoint! Glides on well, very buildable, and I love the consistency of the formula. Personally though won't be repurchasing the full size because I feel like it smudges easily and it’s hard to remove especially from my under eyes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella thicc is a MUST HAVE,10 Apr 2023,1937284Olivia,This mascara is literally the best. I have pretty short lashes and they make them look so long and give them so much volume. And it’s stayed on well like the entire day with no issues of smudging or anything and it’s very lightweight,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Mascara worth the purchase,10 Apr 2023,andi76,Love the formula and the wand! It gives you just the right amount of product so you don’t look clumpy. Will definitely purchase again!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Replaced my #1 Hourglass Caution!,10 Apr 2023,rosielilian,"Ok, so I have been using Hourglass Caution Mascara religiously for YEARS which is very unlike me as I often get bored of products, so for me to switch products is a big deal! I picked this up yesterday as had heard good things and wanted to try as it is cheaper than my usual #1 (Hourglass Caution is $41) and I have been blown away! I tried just 1 coat this morning and my lashes are long, thick and glossy! It was so easy and slick to apply on both top and bottom lashes. The packaging is also so much lighter than the Hourglass chunky and heavy (but beautiful) metal tube so this will be great for travelling. Super happy with this and my new favourite - highly recommend!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
It's ok,10 Apr 2023,Drenie,This mascara is ok. It's light weight and flexible. However my lashes are very curly and appear thick so this message then clump a little.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
it's a NEED,10 Apr 2023,blairekasa,"This is my FAVORITE mascara as of right now. If you want nice voluminous lashes, this is the mascara to use. It is a wet formula so it grabs all of your lashes. if you aren't a fan of a very wet formula, just scrape the wand on the mascara bottle and it works beautifully .",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Its alright,9 Apr 2023,CosiK,"My first reactions are meh. Not life changing but by no means a bad product. I do like the wand but the formula is pretty standard. I havent found myself reaching for it as much as I had hoped, but It does give a reasonable amount of length. My main complaint is that it claims to be volumizing but I really dont see much of that in my lashes (even when combined with a primer).",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
100/10 would recommend,9 Apr 2023,salmer,This mascara works so well with me. It makes my eyelashes look long and voluminous. It doesn’t clump even when I use multiple layers (2 maximum) *don’t need much. Taking it off is easy and it doesn’t smudge. It makes my eyes look so fairy. I love it. Hope they come up with green color for it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,9 Apr 2023,RebelleZ13,"It smudges a lot, which is disappointing because  I like the volume & size of the brush",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
would not purchase again,8 Apr 2023,mariahhkelly,wanted to love it but within only 2-3 hrs it was all smudgy and had a ton of fallout under my eyes.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Mascara that actually works,8 Apr 2023,karmalissa,FINALLY a mascara that is black black and truly coats the lashes!! I’ve been so frustrated with the formulas of mascaras - both drugstore and luxury- for flimsy coverage and lacklustre results. The wand is tapered and makes application easy. Super happy with this purchase.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Luscious lashes!,8 Apr 2023,TabiThoughts,"I love this mascara. My lashes look long, full of volume and sexy. It applies really well and doesn't smudge or flake. It makes my eyes pop!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love it,8 Apr 2023,jennifer322,"This mascara makes my lashes look sooo good. It doesn’t bleed and run even when I spray setting spray on top of it. Idk if it’s just because I haven’t gotten a new tube in a while or what, but I’m definitely noticing a difference.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Too heavy, makes eyelashes flat",8 Apr 2023,FestinaLente1,"I wanted to love it. It's definitely very creamy, but makes my lashes super heavy and takes forever to dry. My lashes are pretty flat (but long) and I need a curler to apply... because it took so long to dry (like 15 minutes) and made my flat eyelashes even flatter and using the curler was useless :(",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new favorite mascara!,8 Apr 2023,Christihb,"This is my new favorite mascara, and one of the best ones I’ve ever tried! My lashes look amazing after just one coat, and it stays all day. Will definitely be repurchasing!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Super mascara—smudged a bit,8 Apr 2023,agathof,"Honestly my only gripe with this mascara is that it smudged quite a bit under my eyes at the end of the day. Other than that it’s really so so good! The formula is glossy and doesn’t feel drying or flaky (and it doesn’t flake off). It’s also like a true black mascara and gave my lashes the length, curl, and thickness I was looking for.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Leaves black transfer under eyes,8 Apr 2023,langleyyy,"I’m not sure why anyone gave this mascara a good review? I love you Riri, but this mascara just isn’t it. At first application it seemed like a decent enough mascara. But after only a couple hours, I had black smearing going on under my eyes. I wasn’t even hot or sweaty. I really wanted to like this, but I won’t buy a mascara that transfers or flakes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,8 Apr 2023,cutiechu,"Lumpy when applying, did not give me volume.  Would not recommend",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new favorite!,7 Apr 2023,Graycekay11,I am obsessed with the packaging and the wand/brush. I think this formula is very easy to work with and is very pigmented! This mascara is so easy to use and I only need 1 coat maybe 2. It is so easy to remove but lasts all day with no smudging or flaking🖤,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hoping it will be less clumpy in 2 weeks.,7 Apr 2023,lilobell05,"I got the sample and have used it twice so far.  It is a bit clumpy right out of the tube, but otherwise I love it. At $19, it is a value.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Lashes Hella thick,7 Apr 2023,glocac,I’m loving the Fenty Beauty mascara hella thick by Rihanna. With one coat I left my lashes long and with lots of volume. I was on smooth no clumping us to your lashes. I would highly recommend this mascara I love it.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Thicc Voluminous Lashes!!,7 Apr 2023,Allie7654,"I love this mascara! Fenty beauty hella thicc left me with thick voluminous eyelashes without having to fuss with them! One coat left my eyelashes dark coated and with lots of volume! I have had a difficult time finding a mascara I liked since they discontinued my favorite mascara,  bad gal lash but this mascara has finally taken its place. I wear contacts and I love that this mascara does not irritate my eyes or flake. The brush does a great job of separating my lashes and not leaving clumps. I love the lift and volume the mascara left behind. You will not be disappointed trying this mascara. You will love the effortless voluminous lashes you get from this mascara!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,7 Apr 2023,haudesirk,This product works great. I have very short lashes and this helped them look lengthened and thicker.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Fenty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara,7 Apr 2023,lauraemmaxoxo,"My lashes are hella thicc after this new mascara! I received this product in return for my honest review and I honestly think it is my new favorite mascara! First, I love the packaging. It's super modern and sleek. When applying the mascara, I needed only a few sweeps to get black, super pigmented, separated, long, and impactful lashes. This mascara also lasted me 16+ hours (I work in healthcare and wear a mask/eye pro in the OR, my lashes still looked freshly applied at the end of my shift). Overall, this product is innovative, makes my lashes look fabulous, and my lashes are long, separated, and super pigmented all day. A must try!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
New Holy Grail Mascara!!,7 Apr 2023,Danifaexoxo,"I have tried so many mascaras and always feel like there is something missing. I got this one and was shocked as soon as I tried it. It goes on extremely smooth, not clumpy at all, lengthening, AND volumizing. I usually have a hard time finding one that meets all those criteria’s but this exceeded my expectations. Wore it through a whole night out and didn’t smear at all, and had people ask me if I was wearing fake lashes!! extremely impressed and cannot recommend this product enough to friends and family!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing formula and delivers voluminous lashes!,6 Apr 2023,Hangy1986,"I absolutely love the formula and for some really amazing reason, it makes the lashes thicker and fuller. A must buy and staple in any makeup collection :)",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
You should definitely try it,6 Apr 2023,JForet,I was really really surprised how much I like this mascara. I received this product in exchange for review and I'm impressed with how well it works. I've used the same one for years from a different brand and I'm probably going to switch. It lengthens and is very bold and noticeable.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Yasssss Riri,5 Apr 2023,xJLK821x,Love the way this mascara applies! Very dark and lives up to its claims of providing thickness. No clumping or flaking for me. Can be easily removed with warm water and makeup remover.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great mascara,5 Apr 2023,Georgemk,"I am very loyal to a specific brand of mascara (have been since 2018), but I am willing to jump ship after receiving this product. This mascara provides fabulous volume and lift to my lashes. It's long-lasting and does not flake off my lashes after 14 hours of wear.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
better than any other I've tried!!,5 Apr 2023,tlcva,"This should be called ""dang girl, what mascara are you wearing?"" because that's what I've heard all day long.  Does lengthen some but really excels at adding volume without clumping. Go slow with the first coat so you don't mash any lashes together and then pile it on with the second coat.  My lashes are long, thick and defined.  Perfect!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great for the curly lashed girlies,5 Apr 2023,Quishaxo,"If you're looking for a volumizing mascara that really delivers, look no further than Fenty Beauty's Hella Thicc mascara. This stuff is seriously amazing. It's perfect for separating and defining even the curliest of lashes, giving them a bold and beautiful look. My curly lashes tend to clump with other mascaras and this was great at defining and separating my lashes. I usually use L'oreal Voluminous Mascara and this brush is very similar but BETTER. 

The carbon black formula is intense, and it applies seamlessly without clumping or smudging. Plus, it's apparently waterproof - I accidentally slept in it one night (oops), but it didn't budge at all! I was so impressed.

Overall, I loved this mascara and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a dramatic, eye-catching look. It's definitely a must-have in my makeup bag from now on!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
a new favourite mascara,5 Apr 2023,katya2004,THE BEST MASCARA EVER MADE MY LASHES LOOK GREAT I LOVE THE WAND.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Really great mascara,5 Apr 2023,aaliyahzhane26,"I have sparse, thin, short lashes (and sensitive, dry eyes). I typically have a difficult time finding mascaras that work well for me, while not being irritating for my eyes. I never cared for the original Fenty Full Frontal mascara because it just didn’t look good on my lashes no matter how I applied it. This mascara surprised me, it’s totally different. I put on 4 coats (it got a little clumpy during the 4th coat). My lashes stayed lifted all day & the mascara didn’t smudge on my eyes. I’ve been applying this mascara everyday for about 10 days straight & I’m really enjoying it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I do need to use a lash primer to really get the lengthening effect.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not perfected yet,4 Apr 2023,lisamgb,"This is like a dupe for dior show. More cons than pros. It’s really pretty and very black, but wayyy too much comes out of the wand so you have to wipe lots off on the tube, and it gave me raccoon eyes like 3 hours in. Bc  Just not great",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Like not love,4 Apr 2023,Kaylynne1012,"The mascara actually worked great. Separated my lashes and coated it evenly, gave a pretty good curl but I was most impressed by the defined lashes, no clumping anywhere! 
However, I looked like a raccoon a couple hours later. So I’ll minus a point for that. I’m assuming this has to do with sweat as it was really hot that day.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Fenty is Plenty!,4 Apr 2023,nicoleeroatti,"I have a hard time with finding mascara that works for me because my eyelashes are thick and straight. This mascara actually worked for me. It gave my eyelashes lift and volume. It made them loo longer and fuller. Usually even when I wear mascara it does not do much for me. Howver, this masacara was a game changer. I did not even have to use an eyelash curler or anything to get my lashes to have volume and fullness! I would absolutely recommend trying this mascara if you are struggling to find one that works for you if you have thick, dull, and straight eyelashes. I will definitely be purchasing more in the future!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,4 Apr 2023,farahn2,"I actually like this product, gives you full thick lashes without having layering too much.  Very easy to use and love the cute packing it comes in!

I really wanna love it but..,3 Apr 2023,BIYARUSA,"I have straight lashes & oily eyelids so looking for a good mascara is tricky for me. Although it is volumizing as claimed, its still too heavy that the curl goes away as soon as its applied to my lashes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great for easy day to day look,3 Apr 2023,Ama11234,"Great mascara, made my little eyelashes look longer and fuller!  Apply just one layer for a quick 
and easy day to day look or apply multiple layers for a more dramatic evening look.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Sadly, a no",3 Apr 2023,Danadoll13,Mascara started to run after an hour of wear. Very disappointing.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great lengthening mascara,3 Apr 2023,Libbyd123,I have loved using this mascara! It is really buildable so the first layer you put on looks very light and natural but with each stroke you get a more dramatic look so it’s great for every day or nights out. It has a really nice consistency so it doesn’t clump or stick to the lashes but glides on so smoothly. I don’t think I've ever used a mascara that has gone on so smoothly. I would definitely recommend. Since it is more smooth do make sure you wait till it dries because I did notice I got some on my under eye accidentally! It is great for both lengthening and adding volume to your lashes since each layer looks more voluminous. I would definitely recommend!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Stays on and long!,3 Apr 2023,mariafinan16,"Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara has a great formula that is super dark and pigmented, but isn't too thick. It goes on smoothly and lengthens and lifts my eyelashes more than other products I've used before. The lift is especially noticeable. It does seem to take longer to dry when it is applied, so I have to be careful not to get little smudges, but once it is on it stays ON. I've worn it through an entire workday and to late events, and it is still on and not flaking off by the time I get home at night. The applicator really separates and lifts lashes. The tube itself is a very cool geometric/gem design, and the applicator/lid closes with a really satisfying click. Loved it!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,3 Apr 2023,LeeeLAW,"This mascara is very volumizing. The wand brush coats each lash evenly and with ease. It
dries fast, so if you have long lashes like me you don't have to worry about it getting on your
eyelids or under-eye. The packaging is also cute!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella Thicc is Hella BOMB and my new FAV !,3 Apr 2023,Decadentdelta,I am in LOVE with Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara !       I was a bit skeptical because I am a contact lens wearer and was concerned about flaking and irritation. I had NONE at all.  I was able to build and separate my lashes during the application of the product.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great for Length!,3 Apr 2023,lizhill4,"This mascara is personally not my favorite. I have very short lashes with very little natural lift. This mascara did provide length and after using an eye lash curler and the mascara, my lashes fell flat. It did last and did not flake off! Would recommend for someone who wants length from their mascara!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Wished it worked for me,3 Apr 2023,Je55a,"I really wanted to like this mascara but unfortunately it did not give me the “umph” I was looking for. My lashes are usually decent looking without mascara (some friends are jealous of that) and love giving them the extra color, volume, thickness. But i did not get the extra volume with this. I got color and thickness and it lasted but no volume.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Long, luscious lashes!",3 Apr 2023,lovejayjayy,"This was a great mascara to elongate my eyelashes! Forewarning, this mascara does clump, but if you comb through it, you’re eyelashes would look to die for!

Love it!,2 Apr 2023,msumadams,Loved this smooth coating mascara. Got a sample of it to try and it’s lovely. Does exactly what I need it to do. No clumping. No need to reapply during the day. Perfect everyday product.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
THICC VOLUME,2 Apr 2023,maddiedezara,"I love this mascara! It’s super dramatic. Which I love, so if you are a natural looking  lashes kind of person, I don’t think you’d like it. It blew me away with how much volume in one coat! It’s perfect for my everyday look (I love big, bold, seen by NASA mascara). I’m so glad I tried it on a whim. It’s super inky and makes my blue eyes pop with volume and lift. 

Thicc gurl summer!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Great color and coverage.,2 Apr 2023,michavalon,Flares my lashes out great. Stayed put all the way through my work shift.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,2 Apr 2023,jadeisabelle,"I never thought it was necessary to splurge on a mascara but this one might make me reconsider. There’s fibers that attach to your lashes to give you a super cute spidery look, I usually use tubing mascaras and I prefer this formula more because it doesn’t flake off! It does smudge but not terribly. Super dark which i love and does last long!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Dark and Voluminous,2 Apr 2023,jaysbeautybar,This is overall a good product! I really liked the wand and easy application. I got great voluminous and thickening results. Maybe the only issue was the smudging after applying but that’s an easy q-tip clean.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Omg exactly what I needed,2 Apr 2023,Niajack,So I have long eyelashes but always want more volume and definition.  Well this did it for me. Fenty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara did it for me. This will definitely be my must have Mascara.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,2 Apr 2023,jordy089,"This is a great volumizing mascara, and coats the lashes beautifully.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Huge Ripoff for the price!,2 Apr 2023,beautyy91,Don’t let the cheaper price fool you. It’s because there’s only .034oz of product in the tube. Normally mascaras are like .28-.35oz. So the fact that this one is like 1/10th of that is a joke. Stay far away and buy something where you get your money’s worth!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love the wand,2 Apr 2023,Larkspur37,"This is a great mascara for a dramatic look. I love the tapered brush. It makes it easy to get plenty of volume, while the thinner edge allows you to go into corners and get every lash. The formula wore well and I didn’t notice any flaking or smudging. I like that this isn’t just volumizing, but it also added length. You can get some clumps if you don’t clean off the excess from the wand, but most of the time I just got boosted lashes that looked great. The packaging is also really cool and unique, giving this all the cool girl vibes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Left me shook,2 Apr 2023,madamfacepalm,This formula is so buildable it’s SICK. I’ve been team Too Faced for YEARS honey. But this will be the only one I buy for 2023 🫡,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Short Lash Friendly 🫶🏼,1 Apr 2023,Jazzberryx,My lashes are short and it worked wonders for me!!! 🫡🖤✨,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
New favourite ✨️,1 Apr 2023,DariannaM,"I love everything about this mascara; the application, the texture, the effortless build-ability.  I was already in love with Fenty's OG mascara but this baddie is my new fave.  

The new design of the mascara itself is so glam, but the real highlight is in the application and results.
I personally have small eyelashes that are slightly curled and this mascara did wonders without my having to use a curler or mascara primer.

11/10, this mascara will always be among my products from now on 🙌🏽",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Good Mascara,1 Apr 2023,jayjas,"This is overall a good product! I really liked the wand and there was easy application with it as well. I got great voluminous and thickening results. I did find that it does not last well over a prolonged period of time, it did smudge a lot under my eyes. I would recommend it if wearing for a shorter period of time. Overall good product!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A must-have,1 Apr 2023,Ileanasp,"I never write any review but this one deserves it. It extends my lashes up to the sky and I love the creamy texture. Maybe not for beginners because of the brush but if you’ve been looking for a great mascara, this is the one!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Amazing mascara,1 Apr 2023,skinbykenny,Great mascara for more wet prone eyes without transfer when dry! And for the price it’s a steal,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Disappointed...😰,1 Apr 2023,Sb20211,"Ok ... No. I was so excited about this and bought it on an impulse. ( I have super blonde eye lashes, in my mid 30's btw)
The price is only 19$, which also made it easier to buy. I've been using IL Makiage Icon mascara for 2 years and absolutely love the way it separates each individual lash. The only problem is it smudges under my eyes. So finally I decided to ""upgrade"" and buy this one. ...
I'm so disappointed with this mascara. I only had 1 try to get the mascara on my lashes because It is so black and goopy and clumps my lashes together. The bottom lashes looked WAY better than the top. It took forever to dry as well and as soon as I blinked it transferred everywhere. I really wanted to love this. It's def not for me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
ONE OF THE BEST MASCARAS EVER!,1 Apr 2023,debetters,STUNNING! I’m super picky about my mascaras but this makes top 5 favs of all time! I pair it with waterproof telescopic & it’s the perfect combo. Great mascara by itself too!! Go in with a light hand!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
New Favorite!,1 Apr 2023,specialkayrina,"Loving this mascara! Fenty Beauty has really stepped up their game and I am here for it! This mascara goes on nicely and stays on, no smudging at all even throug all day wear! Makes my eyelashes look amazing- that extra volume boost is just what I was hoping for! Definitely a nee favorite!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not clumpy,1 Apr 2023,MHSswimmer,I have been pretty loyal to a mascara for some time and received this to try. I feel like it works really well in terms of thickening and lengthening my lashes without being clumpy. The color is very dark which I personally love. I do find I have to let it sit for a second before I move my eye too much or it transfers easily but the product itself works well.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Not so THICCC,31 Mar 2023,NYmakeupluv,This mascara is very black and if your want or need lengthening this is for you but it does NOT thicken them or give any volume it should be called Hella Length,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Not bad option, not thicccc enough!",31 Mar 2023,drmansfield,It made my lashes long and thin looking. I felt like the length was nice and black but didn’t make them as volumized as I would usually like. Would have wanted some more!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Nice,31 Mar 2023,treesamarie,I got a sample yesterday and I really like this mascara. Easy to go on and build.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,31 Mar 2023,MomPants,I am bummed this is so flaky! I will be returning it did not stay on was a clumpy mess.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
New staple!,30 Mar 2023,jessiepie96,The outcome with this product was absolutely flawless! I had no issues wearing it and no issues with it coming off easily! It stayed on for hours upon hours! Will be purchasing again! 🥰🥰🥰,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,30 Mar 2023,Elusiveunicorn,"Most definitely added a lot of volume and a look of length to the lashes. Stays on well. Very dark. Unfortunately had to use another brush to get the bigger clumps out, which was not ideal.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I wanted to like it,30 Mar 2023,navypointmom,I wanted to like this mascara but it left my lashes feeling heavy and it clumped,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Not for me, but could be for you!",30 Mar 2023,Ruthlessss2,"I didn't really like this mascara personally as I usually use waterproof, however I can see how this can work for people who don't like waterproof mascara.  It wasn't clumpy and the brush was easy to use.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Pleasantly surprised!,30 Mar 2023,GlamByKam90,"This mascara is very volumizing and not clumpy. I normally use the drugstore voluminous and like this better. Unexpectedly, the wand grabbed onto every little lash, even ones I didn’t know were there! It made my lower lashes look thicker than they ever have. I also like the wand design, which tapers to thicker on the bottom, and makes your outer corner lashes more lifted and longer looking.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new fav !!,30 Mar 2023,Omoney,it does exactly what it says it will. i love it & have switched from lash extensions for this !,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
"Easy application, volume lashes, and Removes well",29 Mar 2023,wheresjessica,"I'm the kind that hardly ever wears mascara, but this year I wanted to try and add mascara and fix my eyes more. It really does make a difference! I received a sample of this mascara, but the 5 stars is not because I got the sample. I immediately loved the bristles. It doesn't look clumpy and I didn't need to dip the mascara back in. With the bristles, I really felt every eyelash getting brushed with mascara on them. It didn't make my eyelash longer, but it definitely gave off the illusion they were thicker and longer (very fluttery). I curled my eyelashes before applying too and they didn't uncurl after wearing the mascara all day. It did rub off under my eyes during the day, but I feel that's with most mascaras. Out of curiosity, after I came back home for the day, I went straight to the shower without using makeup remover, most of the mascara fell off, and there was some residue under my eyes and my eyelids. I ended up using makeup remover after that. 

On the picture of me holding the mascara was me wearing the whole day. The daylight picture was when I was wearing the mascara for about 5-6 hours",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Falsies forever!,29 Mar 2023,RDC1902,"I’ve been searching and searching for the right mascara forever. This is it! My lashes look like I’m
Wearing falsies!!! If you are looking for a mascara that does it all look no further!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must have,29 Mar 2023,JL2022,"Every my eyelashes stay all day length, curl, very natural and waterproof. It makes my eyelashes look like I have full lashes. It is not too expensive, too. I don't have any clumps and it takes off easily with cleaning water.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Thicccc,29 Mar 2023,kbabyr,Mascara is really black which is great! My eyelashes do look hella thicc and full! I like the product. Didn’t smudge. 5/5,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Definitely made my lashes thicc,29 Mar 2023,tokkie3,I This mascara made my lashes look thicker and held a curl for about half a day before I needed to refresh. The formula did rub off to my under eye though and need makeup remover to get off. I received this for free for my opinion,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Perfection in a tapered bottle,28 Mar 2023,alexxxxxa,This mascara is definitely thicker than anything I’ve ever experienced and I’m here for it! I have fairly fine lashes so the thickness this gives my lashes is amazing. The fact that it doesn’t transfer and holds up all day - and that’s saying something from someone who lives in the humid South! Biggest tip would be to apply lightly and not too heavy handed - a little goes a long long way!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
My new favorite mascara!,28 Mar 2023,Meoww88,"This mascara is AWESOME!!! It surprise me how it makes my eyelashes long and thick!! I post the photos with one eyelash using Fenty Beauty mascara and the other is my original eyelash, and no make up on other than the mascara so you can see how different it makes! Im so in love! Its easy to apply and very cute design! Thanks Fenty Beauty for the free mascara, this will be my go to mascara! And will try more another products from this brand!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
COMPLIMENTS GALORE,28 Mar 2023,justsouknoww,"This mascara has gotten me sooo many compliments. all of the old ladies at work can’t believe im not wearing fake eyelashes. it’s very thick but i love the clumpy look so just keep that in mind, i think it does wonders. 

I did receive this product in return for a review, but i would have went out and bought it myself. and i will continue to buy it because it doesn’t smear at the end of the day and it’s so worth the money.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must grab!!!,28 Mar 2023,KyleS93,"Absolutely loved this mascara!!! Guys it’s thicker than a snicker so if you get clumps the first time, don’t fret!! Just reapply lighter and thinner layers! Trust the process cuz my lashes have never looked this long!!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
,28 Mar 2023,kaitlynnnclare,"My go to mascara has been the too faced better than sex, but it is been replaced by this fenty mascara. My lashes look thicker and longer without caking. I would buy this product and I’ve already recommended it to family and friends",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella Amazing!!!,28 Mar 2023,meluna2629,The name is perfection and the packaging is so cohesive with other products in the line.  I really appreciate that you can set it on your vanity and it doesn’t roll off. The formula is not to wet or dry.  The size of the brush is perfect for upper and lower lash application. It is super volumizing and lifting and it doesn’t clump or transfer. I absolutely love this mascara .,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love!!,28 Mar 2023,Blovro,"I have always liked fenty beauty and never had any issues. I am picky about my mascaras so I was a little worried. I received it and was almost nervous to try it because I didn’t want to hate any fenty products. Well, I definitely do not hate it. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MASCARA! This is by far one of the best ones I have used. One coat is like four coats of any other brand. This is worth the money!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
A must-have!,28 Mar 2023,TiffanyLuns,"Amazing product! No clumps and my lashes are so long and full. If you haven’t tried this product, run don’t walk!",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Buy!!!!!,28 Mar 2023,Alligatorm,I received this product to sample and I’m absolutely in love!!! I will be purchasing!! After Covid and getting pregnant my lashes have thinned out so much. Using this mascara made my eyes pop and lashes rise up I love it and will highly recommend you to try it,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
OMG! Stunned at how natural it looks!,28 Mar 2023,IshikaY,I used it for the first time at a conference I was invited to and my friend looked at my lashes and said your lashes look better did you curl them? Use lash serum? And when I told her I had mascara on she refused to believe me because there was ZERO clumping and it made my lashes look long but natural! It gave me a really nice and bold look and went with my vibe while still giving a clean girl aesthetic! Such a must have I am literally obsessed.,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love this mascara!,28 Mar 2023,KatAttack87,I really love this mascara - it makes my lashes pop! It's long wearing but easily comes off at the end of the day. The color is perfect. I will definitely be getting this mascara again in the future!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must have!,28 Mar 2023,TynkB,"I love this Mascara from the bottle to the product. I love the fact that it does not run, and it’s easy to remove. It gave me so much volume. Rihanna is definitely doing big things.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must have product,28 Mar 2023,emililyle,It’s “hella thick” . It’s thick and long lasting . Really good product. I have been used so many mascara and i like this a lot . It saves me time and beautiful,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Love this mascara,28 Mar 2023,Allison0528,"I got this product for free in exchange for writing a review.

This mascara is amazing. I have used many brands of high end mascara and the volume on this one is incredible and it does not clump. Its a deep black color and makes your eyelashes look long as well. It stays on all day and doesnt give you raccoon eyes. This makes you look like you have false lashes on. I got many compliments while wearing this mascara at a party. I would absolutely buy this product and recommend to family and friends.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Just Try It!,28 Mar 2023,AdriL18,This product was super easy to use and lasted all day! I especially loved the volume that it gave to my lashes and I used it on my top and lower lashes!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Unfortunately not for me,28 Mar 2023,mandypandy1987,"The outside packaging of this product is nice.  The actual container the mascara is in is also nice because it is shaped differently and has some weight to it.  It is also easy to hold.  When I first applied the mascara, it started a little clumpy but I thought maybe just because it is brand new that this was the case.  I tried to wipe it off on the rim of the container a little.  Once it wasn't as lumpy it did go on my lashes pretty nicely without having much clumps.  I also did not have to reapply multiple coats for it to lengthen my lashes which also saved time.  I put it on one side of my face just to compare it to the side without any mascara and it definitely made a difference.
I wore it around the house the entire day and it lasted for the most part, except there was a little black that had accumulated underneath my eye.  My other mascaras wear very well throughout the day and I would be worried this one might run somewhat and I would need to keep checking the mirror.  By the end of the day, my lashes didn't seem as black or volumized as they initially were.  I guess this is also not waterproof because as soon as my face got wet, it really ran down my face. The good news is that it was very easy to get off with makeup remover and did not leave a residue on my lashes.  Overall, it went on smoothly and looked good at first but if you are planning to wear it for an entire day I don't know if this is the product for you.  I will try it one more time when I am going out somewhere for a short time period but not for an important event.  I am going to stick with my Thrive Causemetics mascara for now but I do appreciate the invite to try this mascara.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
LOVE THIS MASCARA,28 Mar 2023,Mabeeshopping,I LOVE this mascara OMG! I normally buy drugstore mascara but this has totally made me change my ways. It glides on super smoothly and lengthens my lashes a lot! It can get a little messy so be careful when applying but that’s nothing a q-tip can’t fix haha def recommend,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Among my favorites,28 Mar 2023,newbiefaceart,"Have used quite a few times so far and it is definitely noticable and dries beautifully, however it tends to clump quite a bit. Other than the clumping, i love the volume it gives me.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
I’m obsessed,28 Mar 2023,PrettyB30,I am completely obsessed with this product! The brush is absolutely perfect! I’m able to grip the handle with ease. The color is so bold! The pictures don’t give it justice! It definitely gives a nice dramatic effect!,Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Must try! lengthening and voluminous,28 Mar 2023,sherelluvs,"The Fenty Voluminous Mascara is soo goood . I love it so far Compared to other mascaras available in the market, this product stands out due to its ability to add volume and length to lashes without clumping or smudging. The unique formula is infused with nourishing ingredients such as jojoba oil, which helps to keep lashes healthy and strong.
One of the benefits of owning this product is that it can give you a dramatic lash look that lasts all day long. The wand is designed to separate and coat each lash, providing a bold and voluminous effect. Additionally, the formula is long-lasting and water-resistant, making it ideal for all-day wear.
If you're someone who loves voluminous and dramatic lashes, then the Fenty Voluminous Mascara is definitely worth trying!! However, if you prefer a more natural look, then this mascara may not be the right fit for you.
Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a high-quality mascara that can add volume and length to their lashes.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
Hella Thicc is a winner!,27 Mar 2023,alsoknownasSK,"An honest review from someone who wasn't a fan of Fenty's first mascara. I'm a mascara snob and absolutely love Hella Thicc. I wear mascara just about every day, even if I'm not wearing any other makeup. I don't wear falsies, so a quality mascara that consistently performs is important. 

Hella Thicc gave me volume and length! One coat and I was satisfied for a day of errands. I prefer my lashes to clump together, but I hate when the product is clumpy. Hella Thicc lightly clumped, without leaving behind tons of product. 

The color is a true jet black, dried quickly, and was flake free. There was minimal transfer after 60 seconds, and there was no transfer throughout the day. It was easy to remove, my lashes didn't feel weighed down, and I didn't notice any missing/pulled lashes after removal.

Will definitely be a staple in my rotation.",Fenty Beauty,Mascara,Yes
