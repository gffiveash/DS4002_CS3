"So easy to use and blend! On quick/almost no makeup days, it's easy to use on cheeks and eyes for a little boost.",30 Jan 2025,,BeautyLlama,Anastasia,Blush,No
"This is an easy to use stick, can glide on face, use fingers or brush to pick it up. Can be patchy and lift makeup underneath. Maybe it‚Äôs just this shade, but not the longest lasting.",27 Dec 2024,,jjpatzlaff,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I was so excited for this one! The colour and texture are so nice‚Ä¶but the pigment is not there. It literally disappears on my skin when I‚Äôm trying to blend it. It‚Äôs not buildable. The idea with a brush is awesome, I wish it worked, but it‚Äôs useless. Just save your money",15 Nov 2024,Sadly bad(,tiumiu,Anastasia,Blush,No

"This is the worst blush I‚Äôve used. It does not blend, and the brush with it does not extend out to blend. It‚Äôs useless. The color is pretty, but if it doesn‚Äôt blend well, what‚Äôs the point? I got it on sale and didnt pay full price, thankfully. Go with NARS, Rare Beaity or Danessa Myrick.",24 Oct 2024,Not a fan,jenngentry,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I love the creaminess, color, and applicator stick. It‚Äôs so convenient that it comes in a stick form with a brush. The two big misses for me: the brush isn‚Äôt great and the pigment is not there! No matter how much I put on, it just disappears. It‚Äôs so weird! If it was more pigmented or stayed longer it would be 5 stars for me!",12 Oct 2024,Creamy but no pigment,MegMarieD,Anastasia,Blush,No
i love this blush so much. i was a little weary about getting it but i decided to because i generally love anastasia items. i tried it as soon as i could and i loved it bevause of its easy application and gorgeous finish! for reference i have light skin with pink undertones and i used this while on vaca so i was tanner and sunkissed but this shade was the only one in stock atp and i ended up loving it; purchasing the pink dalia asap.,7 Sep 2024,beautiful blush,mirgs,Anastasia,Blush,No
Not too pink but a nice peachy pink shimmer. Looks good in spring/summer or when you want a nice subtle glow.,3 Aug 2024,Perfect everyday shade,elizabeth32,Anastasia,Blush,No

"The cream stick blush is decent but not spectacular. It gives a nice shimmer, so it can double as a highlighter. However, the brush isn't great‚Äîit tends to separate the blush and leave a patchy look. I prefer using my fingers for a more even application. It gets the job done but isn't my favorite.",17 May 2024,,dvnlse,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I love the color and the application, and I love how small it is, but I absolutely hate the brush, I want it to be bigger‚Ä¶ maybe I need to keep getting used to it? But I do love the blush",4 May 2024,"Good blush, bad brush",AmyKlem,Anastasia,Blush,No

Love the formula and this shade. It blends so easily into my skin!,14 Mar 2024,,kori0613,Anastasia,Blush,No
I tried the shade Latte because it came as a product on my Boxy Charm and I really liked it. Easy to blend and to travel with. It has a lot of product at least in my opinion. I used to buy the milk blush but it got very expensive and now they only sell the mini size :( I really wanted a cool/neutral pink blush so I went with this due to the great experience with Latte. It's very pretty. I don't really use the brush to blend it. I find it's better to use my fingers or a sponge.,12 Mar 2024,Great product,MooniPhantom,Anastasia,Blush,No

I love this blush and wear it every day. I have very dry fair skin and it blends beautifully and looks very natural.

I‚Äôm shocked this product has such great reviews. I loved the color in store. Purchased and when I put it on it blends into nothing‚Ä¶ maybe as a starter blush‚Ä¶. If you want a nice color that will easily blend and last this isn‚Äôt.    Will be returning. it.,10 Jul 2023,Blends into nothing,ReynaK,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I am always on the hunt for a long-lasting blush (staining-quality) but this is unfortunately not it. The color applies sheer but buildable which I love as I do not like loud blushes.

"I kinda regret buying this blush stick. I was very exited to buy it because I saw some YouTube reviews describing the Latte shade as the perfect shade to go with any look and it looked so beautiful in all the videos that I saw that I wanted to buy it, specifically to minimize the amount of makeup that I take with me when traveling. Well, that's not going to be possible because although I love the format of this product, the packaging, the shade, the initial pigmentation, and the blendability, it simply lacks staying power. I have several shades of the Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blushes and those have amazing staying power. They are trickier to blend, but once you learn to work with them they are awesome for combo skin throughout the entire day. I also own several Tarte Maneater Blush & Glow Cheek Plumps and the Charlotte Tilbury
Beauty Highlighter Wand in Pinkgasm and both of them are easy to work with and have excellent staying power. Sadly my expirience with this ABH blush stick has not been good and I would not recommend buying it if staying power is important for you.",8 May 2023,"Beautiful, but very disappointing",ynlt,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Beautiful color or light skin with warm undertones. It‚Äôs like the perfect sun-kissed color. Great for summer.  It‚Äôs pigmented, blends like a dream and last all day! Prefer to blend using my own brush but this brush is better than most you find in the back of a stick.",22 Apr 2023,Love it,yas973,Anastasia,Blush,No

I love the color of this blush and how it comes with a brush on the other side to blend it in. Creamy and looks natural. Pretty good blush and no complaints just not my new holy grail.,9 Feb 2023,Good Blush !,hana77709,Anastasia,Blush,No
"It was a toss up between 1 and 2 stars. I purchased this after reading reviews that had it as one of the top rated stick blushes. I swear reviews are all paid for or incentivized so it's hard to find a genuinely well-rated product, and sadly, this is not it. This formula is not blendable at all. Like at allll. I'm a fan of highlighting and contouring with cream make-up and wanted to throw a non-powder blush in the mix but trying to blend this will tear up your other make-up and look blotchy. Very disappointing.",5 Feb 2023,A non-incentivized real review - hard pass.,Lovejoelle,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I usually use Fenty blush creams, and I needed a peach palette. Anastasia Beverly - peachy keen was the perfect colour for my skin. Late thirties, combination of dry and oily skin. Cream formulas last longest on my face and I prefer no shimmer. I dab then blend. Very hydrating and pigmented. I have never broke out on this product and I have extremely sensitive skin. Will be repurchasing.",31 Jan 2023,Amazing formula,blueeyez72,Anastasia,Blush,No
Was super patchy and does not blend well which sucks because I was very excited about this product. Do not recommend.,21 Jan 2023,,mayam1108,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Cream or liquid blushes are probably my favorite things, so this blush was definitely something I wanted to try. I got the shade bubblegum, which has a little bit of a sparkle to it, but I personally love that. This blush is so easy to apply that it's kind of insane. I spend about thirty seconds on my blush. It comes in a stick form with a brush, so I just put a short line on the top of both of my cheekbones and a small line vertically on my nose and blend it. It blends really nicely and has a nice, pale pink which is very natural. I love this blush for days when I'm in a bit of a rush or want a very petal, pretty pink look.",17 Jan 2023,,rose7mari,Anastasia,Blush,No
Pretty color but the formula is off. Doesn‚Äôt blend well and made my skin congested.,14 Jan 2023,There‚Äôs better options,beachy28,Anastasia,Blush,No
"This is a great cream blush! It is very easy to apply and blend- however, the brush is not needed if put onto face properly. It‚Äôs very buildable, so if I want a very bright, shiny blush then I can apply more strokes, however, for a fairylike, flushed look I apply one or two strokes. This blush has not broken me out- and I have seen some websites say it is a great acne-safe blush- however, don‚Äôt take my word for it, research for yourself. It is a wonderful, light cream blush and I highly reccomend.",27 Dec 2022,Easy-to-use cream blush,RMaryS,Anastasia,Blush,No
"As a blush, I am not a fan of this product because I don‚Äôt like cream blushes. But as a lipstick, this shade is amaaaaazing! It‚Äôs the perfect matte neutral, and I absolutely love the versatility of this color!",22 Nov 2022,Love this as lipstick!,ctopanga,Anastasia,Blush,No
Just seemed to fade after applying. I had high hopes for this color.,7 Nov 2022,Looked nice then faded...,LynetteV9,Anastasia,Blush,No
I love this color and wanted this to work so badly but after trying about 10 times with a variety of brushes this is one of the worst products I have ever purchased. This blush is hard to blend and is always spotty no matter what method I use to apply. I wish this was available in a powder blush as this is the perfect shade for my skin tone.,6 Nov 2022,Disappointed,Christina57,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I bought the soft rose and it‚Äôs a pretty, light purpley color. The color goes on very easily to the point that I worried I‚Äôd gotten too
Much on my face but I was able to pat my finger in to blend. I don‚Äôt like a ton of color and this formula lets me control how much is deposited on my skin. I thought I‚Äôd need the included brush but I don‚Äôt really use it much. My fingers work fine. The brush bristles are tightly packed together.",3 Nov 2022,Pretty,SCGreen,Anastasia,Blush,No

"Ok so this is the best one I have tried yet.  all other brands don't seem to be pigmented enough and I end up needing a ton of product just for it to show up.  Not this - a little goes a long way.  I also love the included brush - not sure why so many are saying they don't like the brush because it's too stiff.  I find it perfect, also so great when travelling as you don't need to pack a separate blush brush.  You can blend with your hands too but what I love about the brush is you don't need to get your hands messy.  I normally have a light-medium skin tone, but tanned in the summer, and I was worried the pink dahlia colour might be too intense but it is just perfect after it's blended in.  Gives a really nice natural glow.  Love everything about this product.",20 Jul 2022,Best stick/cream blush I have tried,ains19,Anastasia,Blush,No

"Been searching for a dewy looking cream blush. Tried a few liquid-cream blushes. I‚Äôm just not very good at applying because I can never get an even application‚Ä¶blotchy uneven look. This stick cream is the closest to foolproof for me when it comes to cream. Finally, a cream blush I can work with! I apply dotting on then tapping it on cheeks with the included brush. I also blend if needed to soften lines. No harsh lines! Blends well. Love this dewy, radiant, glow look. I‚Äôm warmer in skin tone and have tanned skin.

I LOVE this blush. I have it in two shades: Soft Rose and Latte. They both give a beautiful natural color. It is a little stiff but stil creamy. I like it like this because it is easy to apply without getting messy or putting on too much. I do not use the brush on the end because it is too stiff and doesn't work well for me. I use a denser blush brush (but not as dense as the built in brush) and it works great. Latte is my favorite color of the two - it looks really natural and effortless.,12 Apr 2022,,GingeMadi,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I really like the color of this blush. I use cream blushes only, so the color was a nice addition to my makeup supplies for some variety. I thought I would use the brush part, but I really don't - I just use my fingers to blend it in which just works better.

I am over-the-moon in love with the tight, firm, yet soft brush applicator, too.  I love the quality of the brush that allows easy placement on my face.

This creamy blush stick melts into skin for a sweet color payoff that is totally adjustable.  It is comfortable on the skin and feels like you are not even wearing blush.  Use your fingers or the handy brush attached to the end of the stick to disperse.  You can layer for more intensity.  I have to admit cream blush is a favorite formula for me if the color and quality are high and this lovely stick meets the bill.  I really enjoyed using this whether I was just wearing a little tinted moisturizer or over full foundation.   The only improvement I would recomend is to make the attached brush bristles a bit longer.  This does not affect the blush itself but would make application a little smoother.    The current bristles are short and firm but work ok if you don't want to use your fingers or another blush brush.   Overall though typically brushes are not attached to cream sticks so I prefer the versatility of having this accessory versus none.  Another positive is that there was no streaking or patchiness whatsoever.  It lasts longer on top of foundation and powder but that is typical for blush.  You can even smear a little on the lips and apply lip gloss on top for a natural lip look.  The pretty gold casing is very cute too.  I would definitely purchase this again as I am always on the lookout for great cream blushes.,4 Oct 2021,Finally a great cream blush!,beautybyme,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Just got this yesterday and wearing it today . Lovely fall colour.  I am curious to see how it wears . I wanted something long lasting and hope fully this it it . The colour is gorgeous and i only swiped one time andI had plenty . Not sure about the brush on the end as other reviews have mentioned it is a little dense for blending . I topped it off with a powder blush so lets see how it lasts , but so far I am Impressed .",22 Sep 2021,So far .. So good,michiepoo,Anastasia,Blush,No

"Love ABH! Love this cream blush. A cream blush that has a shade that is for cool toned girls. I‚Äôm very fair with pink undertones so all the warm blushes do nothing for me. Pink Dahlia a win for me!! Great pigment. I dip
My brush on the tip and then stipple it on my cheeks and it takes so very little used to color my cheeks. So advice is to apply it this way instead of swiping stick on cheek and then blending. Saves a lot of the product.",8 Sep 2021,,JennyW47,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I‚Äôll be honest when I got this blush as a sample I was wary because it is not a shade that I would typically pick for myself and complexion, but I was grateful and wanted to give it a try. I was actually so pleasantly surprised on how the color turned out on my skin, which leads me to believe the latte color and all the available shades will look great on many different skin tones! The blender brush side is nice and soft and really buffs and blends out the color nicely and evenly. I am used to liquid blush but really liked how the cream spread and the brush can precisely put the color where you want which is sometimes a problem I run into with liquid blush and using my finger as an applicator. Will be using this for a while to come and excited it‚Äôs a new color for me than what I‚Äôm used to. Definitely a great fall shade!",7 Sep 2021,Latte works on so many skin tones!,laurmac15,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I‚Äôve been using a powder blush for YEARS - I think the last time I had a liquid or cream blush was in middle school. But boy have I missed this stuff! I love this product and have used it pretty much daily since receiving it. The pigment is nice, it‚Äôs long-lasting, and is generally pretty blendable. I didn‚Äôt think my blush needed a revamp, but I‚Äôm very glad for having received this product as it‚Äôs something new for me to incorporate into my routine.

"I have never really been one to use cream products as I had oily skin for the longest time that wouldn‚Äôt really allow for that but now that I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôm leaning more to combo skin so I‚Äôve opened up to more formulas. I got the shade Peachy Keen as I love peach toned blushes and it‚Äôs sooo pretty!!! It‚Äôs easy to use and easily blends into my skin so I think all kinds of people would be able to enjoy it. It‚Äôs creamy yet the color payoff and lasting power is still really good. I would repurchase these a million times over! The brush on the other end seems to work decent too but I prefer using a sponge over anything. It gives cheeks a natural, healthy looking blush. A little goes a long way!",3 Sep 2021,I AM IN LOVE,,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I‚Äôm still pretty intimidated with cream blushes, but this was a nice, user friendly product. It blended out so nicely. After a few uses I wasn‚Äôt afraid to apply too much. It also had wonderful staying power. I still noticed it after a full day‚Äôs wear. The only thing that really bothers me about it is the price. $32 just seems a bit much for what it is.",2 Sep 2021,,KyleeKhaos,Anastasia,Blush,No
"So my first impression is that I love the packaging of this blush. I love the convenience of having a brush for blending on hand and how luxurious the gold tube looks and feels.

I would definitely purchase this product in the future.",2 Sep 2021,Love this product!,cristabelwilma,Anastasia,Blush,No
I have fair skin and medium brown hair. I received the shade Peachy Keen which has a little too much coral color for me. After applying I felt like I looked like a clown or sunburned. If I had a different shade I think it would look better. The application was easy and it‚Äôs very blendable. The built in brush is nice but not necessary for blending.,2 Sep 2021,,awesomeness1989,Anastasia,Blush,No

I have tried using the brush on the end several times but I was never as satisfied with the final result.",1 Sep 2021,,,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Beautiful packaging and a beautiful color! Super smooth texture. It glides on super easily and blends well - using either your hands or the brush attached.

Would definitely buy again!",1 Sep 2021,Beautiful!,marryx,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Sticks are not really my favorite when it is blush, but this one is really smooth and it has nice color and consistency.

I loved this new @anastasiabeverlyhills Stick Blush (in Pink Dahlia) Voxbox!! I‚Äôm a blush girl and this is a great combination for me because it has a built in brush that easily blends the blush perfectly without taking up the product. This is my first cream blush and it‚Äôs easy to work with and the color transfer/pigment is amazing as it leaves a rich color deposit. The brush bristles are soft and blend well.

"I really like formula, shade, and how it is easy to carry to use on the go. Unlike that blush doesn't look matte and it is very buildable. It last long, if I touch my face, or put my face on the pillow it slightly fade, but not in the messy out of shape way. For those moments it is very handy to use the stick with attached brush. In the morning I usually apply it with blending sponge. Doesn't give me any acne break outs and doesn't make pores visible. The shade I have is in ‚Äòlatte‚Äô and goes well on the top of matte bronzer and pinkish highlighter.",31 Aug 2021,Great product on the go!,Uhiyka,Anastasia,Blush,No

I‚Äôm so impressed with this product! I love how it has a side to blend the product in instead of using your fingers. The color is so pigmented and so creamy .

I love stick blushes - so convenient and easy to bring for touch ups. The brush at one end makes it an all in one handbag product! The color payoff is really good - it does last awhile. I live in high humidity so don‚Äôt expect cream products to survive long in the summer - but this did ok. It‚Äôs a really pretty color and I love the packaging!,30 Aug 2021,,sehines,Anastasia,Blush,No
"This product is so easy and convenient to use.  The color is subtle but buildable.  I got the color Peachy Keen and it gives the perfect sun kissed glow.  It is definitely a bonus to have the brush on the bottom end of the stick, it‚Äôs stiff but the bristles are soft so it makes it very easy to blend. Works well with both liquid and power foundations.  Definitely recommend if you are looking for something beautiful, easy and multi purpose.   *I received this item to try for free but the opinion is my own.",30 Aug 2021,"beautiful, easy and multi purpose",gab6784,Anastasia,Blush,No
I received this product to try to give an honest review after use.  Upon first look after taking it out of the box I thought the container was super cute.  I loved the color and that it was double sided.  The cream stick went onto my cheek so nicely and i was able to blend it so well.  It left my cheeks looking a little dewy and I loved that look.

"It‚Äôs hard for me to find a cream blush I also think is purse friendly, but this one is! And the brush is really nice as well.

I also like it as lip tint with a gloss on top.",28 Aug 2021,,kaybnc,Anastasia,Blush,No
"This is a gorgeous cream blush. One side of the stick blush is the blush itself and the brush. It is extremely easy to apply and very long lasting.

I removed a star because the brush was quite stiff, and removed some of my foundation, so I used a stippling brush.",28 Aug 2021,,lchou29,Anastasia,Blush,No
I love this product!! It blended like a dream and didn‚Äôt remove my foundation underneath. The color looks so beautiful even though I‚Äôm very pale. It looks super cute on your nose and lips too! The only problem I have with this product is the brush. I find that it doesn‚Äôt blend out super well with the brush. Any other brush works better. I 100% recommend for people new to cream blush.,28 Aug 2021,Love!!,Katiesilverrr,Anastasia,Blush,No
There is not an Anastasia product that I haven‚Äôt liked! This blush goes on so smoothly for easy application and the brush on the other end helps to blend it well.

I LOVE this cream blush. I was honestly not expecting to like it bc I‚Äôve never loved cream products in stick form but this one really surprised me. The color is really pigmented but not too intense and leaves a nice dewy glow that doesn‚Äôt look greasy. It also didn‚Äôt move any of the product underneath it even when applying directly to the face.

"I received this stick cream blush as a free sample from Influenster to review. When I applied this on my check bones, I already had foundation on. The application was a bit, I wouldn‚Äôt say difficult, but different from my original makeup routine with blush because I had to dab the product instead of swiping it on my check bones. When I swiped it, I saw it took off some of my foundation which was irritating. This is why I proceeded to dab this cream blush instead of swiping it. This is very pigmented so you have to blend it in! It took a little bit of work to blend in but the result was beautiful. I also applied this on my nose bridge to give the effect that I had been tanning on the beach. It looked beautiful! I wore this on a hot 80 degree weather, but it did not look messy or greasy for about 4 hours. After than, I had to apply powder on where I applied the product. I do have oily/combo skin, so this is bound to happen with any cream product. It also comes with a brush side to blend the blush in, which made me love this product more. I overall recommend this product. I gave it four stars because it did take my foundation off where I applied it by swiping.",27 Aug 2021,Beautiful blush,kbeauty13,Anastasia,Blush,No

I have been wanting to try a cream blush again recently and then this one showed up in the mail. I was pleasantly surprised. I like how easy this blush is to apply. I didn't know there was a brush on the other end so I used a stippling brush to apply it and then a beauty sponge to blend it out. It blended out well and easily without blending away. I used it over my fenty beauty eaze drop skin tint for a natural look and loved it. I did try using the brush that comes attached but I didn't care for it. I feel like it's too dense.,26 Aug 2021,,knycolew,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I really love this cheek blush. It goes on creamy and doesn‚Äôt disturb the makeup underneath. It lasts all day for me and I have combination oily skin. It blends out super easily and this particular color looks like my actual natural cheek blush color. It isn‚Äôt a slippery formula and I have plenty of time to blend it out on both cheeks. There is no scent to the stick. I also love that it has a convenient little brush on the end that you can use to blend it out. I took this as my only blush on a recent vacation and it was perfect for travel because it was small and easy to pack and there was no mess at all, and no melting.  I‚Äôm excited to try other colors in this blush stick as well. Great product and I highly recommended it! I included a picture of how this blush swatches and what it looks like blended in so you can get an idea of how the actual color looks on the skin.

"I was so so excited to get to try this stick blush complimentary from Influenster and Anastasia Beverly Hills In exchange for my honest review. I received the shade peachy keen. The packages claimed that it is an illuminating cream blush with flexible coverage and flawless finish. I have been a huge fan of trying new cream blushes lately. The packaging is stunning. The container that holds the blush is double sided with one end containing the cream  blush and one end containing a very small dense packed brush. Both ends have covers to protect each side which I love. This is very travel friendly bc it is a perfect size to through in your purse. The blush color is beautiful. It is a nice bright peachy color that would look good on so many skin tones. 
I absolutely love this blush!! I use it all the time. It is so easy to apply and blend into the skin. I don‚Äôt care for the brush that came in the other end and that‚Äôs why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. But this blush is buildable. You can leave it shear or build it it up to get a much more color payoff. It does have a beautiful illuminating sheen to it as well.

"The blush blends beautifully onto the skin. The color Carmel Peach is a beautiful color. I love how it looks for a natural makeup look. One thing I don‚Äôt like is the brush.the brush is so stiff it doesn‚Äôt blend the product well. I prefer to blend it with a sponge or my ELF 105 stippling brush. It really not good at all, the brush needs to less dense to have more flexibility.

"I had never used a stick blush before, so I was really looking forward to trying this product. I love the packaging and the design of the blush was really neat. I love that there‚Äôs a brush attached. I received the color Latte and to be honest I was a bit nervous that this color wouldn‚Äôt work for me. Latte is described as ‚Äúrosy brown‚Äù and I feared it might be too dark for my skin tone. For reference, I have beige skin (usually under the ‚Äúlight‚Äù shades) and am neutral toned. Surprisingly, I thought the blush worked well on my skin! It didn‚Äôt look too dark or noticeable that I was wearing makeup. However, I don‚Äôt think this color would work with someone with fairer skin or someone who is cool toned and fair. As for application, there was some trial and error involved. I found it easiest to dab on with the stick, then blend using my fingers. You can also use the brush it comes with, and I imagine a beauty blender would also work well with this. I can see this product being great for someone with dry skin who tries to avoid powder products. Overall, I‚Äôm giving it four stars because while I think it‚Äôs a cool product, I definitely prefer regular old powder blush. It‚Äôs just a lot simpler for me to apply and I feel the overall look works better for me. Would I recommend this product to a friend? Sure! If that person is interested in trying a stick blush, I think this is a great place to start.",25 Aug 2021,,nhperry,Anastasia,Blush,No

It does come with a brush at the other end which I don‚Äôt use, I prefer to apply with my finger tips and blend it out. I find the brush to be too stiff for my liking and get a better application with my finger tips. The packaging is very chic and lightweight. I gave 4 stars because I don‚Äôt have much use for the brush",25 Aug 2021,beautiful color,Kati337,Anastasia,Blush,No
"This product was comfortable and lightweight. And was a pretty color. However, it was definitely the wrong color for me. I‚Äôm between light fair and fair and this color wasn‚Äôt a good match for me. It was too orange for me. I couldn‚Äôt used it as contour either. On the right skin tone, I‚Äôm sure it would look amazing. It blended in great into my foundation.",25 Aug 2021,,villaknute,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I started using cream products more in the past year and was excited to try this, and the more I've been using it the more I like it. It's pretty pigmented so you don't need to apply a lot, but it's smooth and creamy in texture and blends out really nicely. Pink Dahlia is a good color for me, I tend to go heavier on blush but this gives more of a natural glow that I really like.

I actually had the problem of overblending it the first few times I used it because I wasn't expecting it to blend out so easily, but I've gotten the hang of it and it's really quick to blend out with fingers or the brush on the other side of the stick. I usually use my fingers for cream products, but the brush works surprisingly well.

I have combination skin and tend to get dewy over the course of the day, but this lasts pretty well and doesn't appear to fade much or at all. Overall, I'm pleased with this and enjoy using it.",25 Aug 2021,I like this a lot,LauraEJ,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I really enjoyed this blush for the most part. the color is great, and the formula is so easy to work with. my only complaint is that it is harder to build up. if you work it too much it just runs away, but if you're going for a lighter application or a softer blush look this is perfect!",25 Aug 2021,,DanielleTeal,Anastasia,Blush,No

Beautiful product! I love the packaging and that its easy to carry in my bag if I need it while traveling or on the go. The color is gorgeous and I love that it comes with a brush to blend the product out all in one package. Its convenient and has a creamy application to give that beautiful blushed affect. You can apply a little or a bit more if you're going for a certain asthetic!,25 Aug 2021,Love this!,CGarcia27,Anastasia,Blush,No
This wasn't a great shade for me even after blending it in. It would be better for someone else I feel with a different comexion. It also doesn't appear to go well with liquid foundation that is matte finish. It was easy to apply but a bit of a learning curve to figure out what works for blending with the brush.,25 Aug 2021,Better with different complexion,Mightymouse2016,Anastasia,Blush,No

I love this stick blush! The color is very buildable and if you go overboard the brush on the other end is so soft and evens out the color beautifully,24 Aug 2021,,bgjinjin,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I recieved this product free from Influenster for my honest review. This is my first stick blush and my first ABH product experience so very exciting. I got this in the shade soft rose which is a beautiful deep rose color that works beautifully on my light skin tone. The packaging is beautiful as well! It comes in a stick compact with one end holding the blush and the other end holding a soft bristle brush to blend out the product on the go. The brush works great and I usually use the brush tho I also like using my fingers instead. Its a buildable blush so u can adjust how deep u want u color to be. My only caveat is it doesn't seem to stay on long, I find I nee do reapply a few 2-3 hrs so deff need a good setting spray or setting powder to try to get it to last better but luckily it's easy to carry around also in case. Although it doesn't last as long I still love it and is definitely a new staple for me.",24 Aug 2021,Beautiful color!,alhu,Anastasia,Blush,No
"This is a convenient blush to throw in your bag when you need a little extra rosiness, however, it lacks staying power. The color was intense going on but blended out to look more natural and glowy. It did take some time to blend out with the brush included. Staying power was much better when I applied a powder blush on top. I would recommend only if you are looking for the convenience of having a brush built in to your cream blush. Otherwise, I feel that other comparable cream blushes stay on longer without the extra step of adding powder blush.",24 Aug 2021,,amberangeline,Anastasia,Blush,No
"This stick formula surprised me since I found it almost as blendable as a compact/powder blush. The built in brush worked great in buffing out the product after swiping it onto cheeks. The brush even pops out for easy cleaning. Although I only have the Milk Makeup blush stick to compare it to, I far prefer this one for it‚Äôs softer and more blendable formula - I found the latter too hard and ‚Äústiff.‚Äù Only taking one star off my review because I still prefer powder blush formulas but I‚Äôll still definitely get a lot of use out of this product - thanks ABH!!",23 Aug 2021,Blendable stick blush,natmanso09,Anastasia,Blush,No
Gorgeous blush! I expect nothing less from ABH. I‚Äôm a peach girl when it comes to blushes and this one is highly pigmented a little goes a long way! My only flaw is the brush on the stick is a bit stiff and doesn‚Äôt blend it like I want. I use a Fluffy blush brush and dab the product on to that and do my blush as normal and I find it blends easier. Such a beautiful color! Top fav.,23 Aug 2021,Beautiful Blush Stick,nollyface,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Giving a three star review at this point simply because I LOVED the dew that this gave to my skin, BUT hated the color for my very pale complexion. Instead of a nice soft peach as it is described as, it was a very bright coral/orange. I personally don‚Äôt like shades like that when I‚Äôm as pale as I am right now. Maybe if I had a nice tan going this would work? As for the attached brush on the opposite end, it is nice and soft but due to how small it is‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt blend very well (instead it creates a small stripe of blush on your face). I would rather use my fingers, a sponge, or a bigger brush. I‚Äôm going to be returning this product and instead buy latte (everyone‚Äôs favorite shade). I‚Äôm really hoping that works as I love the creamy and dewy formula. As for longevity, I didn‚Äôt wear this long enough to attest to that‚Ä¶ I blended it out and hated the color so much I washed it off.",23 Aug 2021,not a good shade for us pale people,dezzyalexandra,Anastasia,Blush,No

"This blush exceeded my expectations so much!  I had never tried a cream blush before.  I was afraid that the application would be a drag.  This product changed my mind, BIG TIME!  I am converted to cream blush because of this product!  The packaging stuck me when I opened the box.  The luxe-looking gold tube is beautiful.  The provided brush on the end is so soft and it applies the blush like a dream.  When I applied the product, I noticed that it melted right in to the skin with very minimal effort.  I‚Äôve also applied with my fingers and got the same beautiful results.  It gave me that lit-from-within look.  The color complimented my summer skin tone beautifully.  This blush was put on at about 7:00am and it was still flawless by 9:00pm!  I was so amazed because I thought it wouldn‚Äôt hold up this southern heat and humidity, but it did!  This was a game changer for me.  Will purchase over and over!",23 Aug 2021,WOW!,misscherryspoon,Anastasia,Blush,No
"So this is a really pretty shade but its too warm for my fair skin. I liked that it included a brush and it blended the blush out nicely. I gave it 4 stars because it works well as a blush just not on fair skin.  For reference my skin is fair but warm neutral. 
I recieved this complementary for my review.",23 Aug 2021,Pretty but not for me.,Lanayyy,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster and ABH. I really like this blush. It applies smoothly, without any tugging. The color is a bit dark for me, but I'm not counting that against the product. I really like the concept of a built in brush, but I feel like rather than blending, the brush ended up spreading the product around more, so I took off one star. Aside from the workability of the brush, this is a really great, creamy product formulation",22 Aug 2021,,Chiara20,Anastasia,Blush,No

"Stick blush that is easy to apply and feels light on the skin. I received Anastasia Beverly Hills Stick Blush in soft rose to test for Influenster to provide my honest review. This shade is perfect for my skin tone. The application was easy to blend and looks like a natural glow to my skin. If I use foundation or not, this stick provides fresh looking skin. Proof is in the pictures.
I generally will use a sponge to apply; however, for this application used my fingers and I was thrilled about how easy the stick smoothed into my skin. I have been using a powder but will move to the stick because of the way it feels on my skin, and also there was no powder to clean off of the counter.",22 Aug 2021,Ultra-lightweight Color,Sweeton,Anastasia,Blush,No

This seems just ok to me. I'm going to preface this review saying I am new to cream blush so this could be the reason for my opinions. It does seem a little bit iffy to blend out for me. I tried the brush it came with and my fingers and it seemed to kind of blend away but was hard to blend to begin with if that makes sense. I really like the color so I'm going to keep experimenting with different ways to apply and see how it works.,19 Aug 2021,Seems ok,Nesee102712,Anastasia,Blush,No

All of these cream blush colors are gorgeous though and I‚Äôm going to get at least one more. The only downside is the brush end.

The brush is nice and easy to clean as it screws off. It's a very pigmented blush so a little goes a long way.  I was happy with how it wore throughout the day.

On the flip side because it‚Äôs so creamy if you don‚Äôt set with a powder over top it wasn‚Äôt the most long lasting, but that can be easily fixed. This item has a natural finish and gave a great flush, I will say the color in person is more on the pink side of the peach spectrum compared to how orangey it looks in the swatch online.

"This product is super pigmented!! I got the shade soft rose which shows up more subtle on my skin tone, but when I put too much it looks almost gray?? It doesn‚Äôt dry down to a powder, but it does give a nice glow. If you have combo/oily skin and want it to last a while you‚Äôll need to set it with a powder blush. It‚Äôs a bit drying on the lips, so I recommend adding a gloss or some balm.

I ended up testing it with a skin tint on and noticed it blended in easier but the brush was picking up some of my coverage, I think tapping it in with fingers of a beauty sponge the best route especially if you have skin on the drier side like me",14 Aug 2021,On the fence,vaginalvoodoo,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I LOVE this blush. I usually use Ilia or Jones Road and think this blush is great. The pink dahlia gives a pop of color, and I love the attached brush too!  Fingers work well with this product too.. I apply several dots on my cheek (thick and luxurious) and blend out with the attached brush on the apples of my cheeks, eye lids and nose. Lastly I apply a few dabs on my lips. It's truly a one and done makeup item.  I brought it on a recent trip, and it was such a space-saver! Bonus, I looked very put together. 

The color is perfect and lasts most of the day-I have used this in both dry and humid heat. I use just a few dabs, so it looks very natural, but better than my normal skin.

"Wow!
We're all familiar with the phrase ""you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone"". With this blush it was truly a case of "" you don't know what you've been missing until it arrives!"". I received this through Influenster, and I am over the moon with it. When it comes to HG products blush isn't the first staple that comes to my mind, but Anastasia absolutely nailed this! The packaging is what would expect from a higher end brand (substantial and well conceived). It contains the product on one side and a dense but soft brush on the opposing end. I didn't think would use the brush, but the applicator was so well designed that it works with the product beautifully. I received the color Peach Carmel, initially in the tube wasn't sure if the color would compliment my NC20-30 skin but it ended up being a gorgeous match! The color payoff is perfect and requires just a touch for a natural look, but is easily buildable.

This is such an easy blush to use. It blends beautifully either with your bare hands either with the little brush that comes with it.

"I have tried multiple brands and types of blush (powder, cream, liquid) and NONE last all day. So I was skeptical that this would be any different but decided to give it a try. And to my amazement it did not budge all day (8 hours) at work. I love the brush to blend it in (does take a little practice but after a couple of days got the hang of it). I do apply a little powder blush on top of this and it seems to help set it. The brush unscrews from the stick as well so you can wash the brush and replace. The stick itself is small enough to throw in your purse too. Beyond impressed!",11 Aug 2021,Lasts All Day!,Katiebug612,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I was pleasantly surprised by this stick cream blush. The packaging is so pretty and convenient for on-the-go / touch-up applications. One end has the retractable blush color stick, and on the other end there's a mini brush to blend the product on your skin. I really like that you can also detach the brush part for cleaning. I got the color 'Peachy Keen' and it is a lovely shade of rosy-peach. The product blends great and it doesn't feel shiny or oily on my skin. I would definitely like to also try it in a different shade.",11 Aug 2021,,SugarPixels,Anastasia,Blush,No

The blush is very easy to blend, either with your fingers or the brush on the end. One thing that didn‚Äôt make me happy was that it doesn‚Äôt last long. I applied setting powder and/or spray over it and within a few hours the color was gone. I definitely need to find out how to make it last longer.

I love how it‚Äôs also buildable.I also did my mom‚Äôs make up and she has fairly lighter skin than me end it still looked really good on her so it works on different skin tones. I also like that it is easy to blend so if by any chance you put too much you‚Äôre also able to fix it so it‚Äôs not a lot anymore and I have to do that fairly often because I have a habit of applying too much blush!

I loved that it came with a brush to help with application, I prefer a beauty blender to smooth my product, but I love that two in one feature.

"The color is beautiful on me (it definitely gives me a natural summery glow), but the formula is just okay. It is sort of like a super lightweight satin lipstick that feels matte (that makes no sense, but it's the best I can describe it). It takes some time to build it up to be as pigmented as desired. It is easy to blend with your fingers, but almost too easy because you can blend it to nothing. I wouldn't use the brush that is included.",10 Aug 2021,"Beautiful color, meh formula and lasting power",janinebean425,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I got the shade Soft Rose and it was a beautiful shade for my medium tan skin! It was quite pigmented when I first swiped it onto my skin, but it blended out decently. It‚Äôs not as blendable as a serum or liquid blush, so I did notice some patchiness - the built-in brush is short so it blends a little rougher. I found that it didn‚Äôt blend well on top of my concealer, so I gifted it to my sister.

So far so good! I really enjoy the color of this blush. It is a nice neutral shade. The formula is easy to blend out and has nice pigmentation without being over pigmented. The packaging also feels nice and sturdy. The reason that I gave this product 4 stars is because I don‚Äôt feel the longevity is enough. In my experience this product looks great when applied but isn‚Äôt the blush I go to when I need my makeup to last for 8+ hours. The product seems to fade throughout the day and lasts about 5 ish hours.

"This blush stick has an interesting cream-to-powder-like texture. I goes on fairly smooth and not patchy. It comes with a built-in brush at the bottom,  which has stiff bristles.

I regularly use the Anastasia pool party blush in a powder which I loved but this cream is 10x better!

"Now, I am not a cream blush kind of gal, but this product honestly changed a lot of my opinions on that. The color at first when I got it, I was a little disappointed because I like a more orangey coral blush. However when this went on my skin, it is the perfect neutral pink but like in the most dusty pink (in the best way possible). It is not a super bright pink, it is not a fuchsia obviously lol. it is not a soft pink even, it is a natural flush for my skin tone. I really love it! Now for the price point of $32? I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs necessarily worth that. I would say 25 to 28 would be good. The little brush that comes with it is kinda hard to clean bc it‚Äôs so dense.

The color is just what i was looking for, it compliments my skin tone very much. I use my fingers to apply it on my cheeks and it gives a natural soft and flawless finish every time that I cannot be happier with!

After i try to blend it with my fingers it was well blended and absorb well to my cheek creating that natural look.

"I received this product free from Influenster and I have never been more excited! I was not expecting much since stuck/cream blushes tend to look garish on me and don‚Äôt blend in. This stick has changed my mind! The color peachy keen fits perfectly with my fair and freckled skin. The cream blends smoothly whether you use the included brush or your fingers. Best bonus? Non irritating or pore clogging! Sensitive and acne prone are not a good combination for new products, but not one breakout or red patch from this makeup. If this runs out, which might take a while since we need so little to pop, I will be at the make up counter for more! Love it.",4 Aug 2021,"Love, Love, Love!",amandamcewen041,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I really loved this color and how smoothly the blush went on. I blended it with a brush. If you‚Äôre medium-tan skin, this will give you a subtle almost coral flush.

"I received this product complimentary from the brand. 
Absolutely loved this blush. The consistency and color are perfect. I got the shade peachy keen and loved it. I‚Äôve used the same blush for years and this is definitely something I‚Äôm looking forward to including in my make up routine more. A little goes a long way with this product. Can be used with or without foundation, the finish is very natural.",4 Aug 2021,,pamelaOAM,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I received this from Influenster for free for my open and honest review. I am absolutely in love with this blush! I don't typically like makeup in a stick format but this did not disappoint. It glided on really smooth and creamy! I love that it didn't disturb my foundation  underneath like many others do, even while blending it out. It blends and even builds like a dream with a regular blush brush or even a beauty blender because I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the brush on the other end. The the color (Pink Dahlia) is absolutely stunning. It‚Äôs became my new staple!",4 Aug 2021,,Mitzi78,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I‚Äôve tried a few stick bronzers and blushes but this one takes the cake! The color is gorgeous and it goes on super smooth and blends easily.

I would definitely recommend it to all.",4 Aug 2021,My new go to!,LivToth,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I‚Äôve been using this product every day for 2 weeks and I really enjoy it! I typically wear this on bare skin with no foundation; however I have worn it over tinted moisturizer and it blended in beautifully. I have used this on its own and by setting it with translucent powder. Setting it does make it last a lot longer, but even on its own it lasts at least 6 hours.

This blush is everything I wanted the Glossier cloud paint to be. It looks great blended out onto a bare face or on top of foundation. It lasts a lot longer than any liquid or stick blush I‚Äôve tried before and it doesn‚Äôt seem to break up my foundation during application. Super buildable!,3 Aug 2021,,gmrufer,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I took this stick blush out of the box and was instantly pleased with the look of it! I took off the cap, love the color (Peachy Keen) and wanted to try it on right away! I swiped a bit on each cheek and started to blend with my finger when‚Ä¶the other side of the stick opened to reveal a brush! A built-in brush! It‚Äôs genius!!! The blush stick itself is creamy and easily blended in to my primer/powder base for a seamless cheekbone glow. The brush has short bristles, which are ideal for blending, and works really well to spread the product exactly where you want it to go! I‚Äôm thrilled with this product and will definitely be looking for more shades that work with my skin tone!!",3 Aug 2021,It‚Äôs got a BUILT-IN BRUSH!!!,meredith53,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Normally, I‚Äôm not a fan of cream stick blushes, but this one impressed me. It was easy to apply because it is creamy and has the right amount of pigmentation. It blended well into my skin and lasted nicely throughout the day. I knocked off one star because I do not like the brush on the other end. I found out that it is detachable, which is nice, but it‚Äôs still too dense and causes the blush to get patchy. I prefer to use a different brush to apply this product. Otherwise, I am really enjoying this blush! Very pretty and I love the rose gold packaging too.",3 Aug 2021,,BWPD28,Anastasia,Blush,No
"This blush stick is very nice but it is not a must have. I received peachy keen and the shade is a lovely soft peachy coral color. This is a double sided stick with blush on one side and a removable brush on the other. The component is a shiny gold tube but it is light weight and a bit cheaper feeling than I'd like.
The blush is creamy, not powdery, and applies well directly to the face or with a brush. It blends easily and leaves a soft sheen behind. When worn on its own, it faded very quickly, like before I left the house quickly. Since, I have set it with a powder blush of a similar shade and it lasts significantly longer than powder or cream alone. Overall, I am happy with this blush and I will definitely get a lot of use out of it.",3 Aug 2021,Good but not the best out there,kluxe,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I love the ingenious packaging of this blush stick! I have liked using cream blushes in the past - but always in flat palette/pot packaging, which I inevitably use my finger to apply (not so sanitary & also takes a careful touch to avoid looking clown-ish). Alternatively, the powder blushes that I love necessitate tossing a separate brush in my makeup bag (which I will often forget). I love that I can swirl this creamy blush on the apples of my cheeks and then use the brush end to spread it and smooth out edge lines. The peachy color is perfect for summer and I will absolutely purchase!",3 Aug 2021,perfect peachy glow,msbritt,Anastasia,Blush,No
So first of all as the title says I absolutely loved this product I‚Äôm not even going to lie. Here‚Äôs why... Number 1 I‚Äôm not an expert make up artist  so I can appreciate the precision application of this product. I always seem to loose a little blush under where I want to apply it. With this product there is no such problem it‚Äôs precision application baby!!! Now number 2 I‚Äôm 40 years and my skin even with a serious skincare routine just doesn‚Äôt seem to hold the moisture it once did. So that leads me to really appreciate the cream blush as it blends super smooth and easy into my skin. To blend I used the provided brush at the other end and I thought it did a great job. The color was very neutral and pretty for my skin tone. I would definitely get this product again!!! I can‚Äôt wait to try more colors!!!

I really enjoyed this Blush stick. It goes on so smooth and blends out great. I love the fact it comes with a brush to make blending easier. It gives such a nice finish!

"I was lucky enough to try the Anastasia Beverly Hills stick cream blush in the shade peachy keen. I have not had the best experiences with blush over the years. I have a light to medium skin with a lot of natural redness. Most blushes often look like clown make up on me. This blush looks gorgeous on and is truly a game changer in the world of blushes!

First of all, the shade peachy keen is perfect for any skin tone. It has a warm, almost clear peach look to it. It goes on so easily and melts right onto my skin. The brush enclosed within the blush is amazing! A total game changer. This product looks amazing in the tube, and goes on flawlessly. I found that this shade gave me just the right look of sun kissed peach, without looking to pink or clowned like. this is definitely a blush I would purchase in the future. I found it gave me just the right amount of color, without adding to the natural facial redness I deal with already.",2 Aug 2021,Beautiful blush!,TheMrsCarter,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I got the latte color and have been loving it! It‚Äôs super easy to apply, I tapped it on top of my foundation to avoid smudging it, then used the brush to blend it further by gently tapping as well. I typically go for a peachy or light pink colored blush, but I really liked the latte color, as it gave me a bronze, sun kissed glow. I used setting powder over top of it to make it less dark/ a bit more subtle. It also works great as a lip tint! I made sure my lips were exfoliated, then used my finger to blend it on my lips and finished it off with a clear gloss.",31 Jul 2021,,cclement5,Anastasia,Blush,No

"Creamy and natural, easy to control. I have found very few blush products that I find both natural looking and easy to control. I have fair to light skin with golden undertones and love the latte color, although it's brown toned enough on me to use as a contour as well as a blush. I use cream and stick blush in the summer especially since I typically go with a more sheer foundation. I wore this with both my sheer, natural-finish liquid foundation and my regular, medium coverage, matte-finish liquid, with and without printer, and I am pleased with how this performs in every instance.

What I love:
Creamy texture glides on easily (no pulling) without being smeary and thin
Color is richly pigmented but also blends easily without losing pigment
Easily buildable
No noticeable fragrance
Natural finish (no glitter/shimmer, naturally radiant but not shiny)
Versatile color
The blending brush is so convenient and it is detachable!

My need for control is so supremely satisfied with this product!

It can also be used as a lip tint, but this particular color washes me out for that purpose. The packaging is very nice and luxurious. There is a brush at the other side, which is nice, although unnecessary. You can also blend it with fingers or a sponge. Overall, I would recommend the shade Peachy Keen to anyone with fair to light-medium skin color who likes effortless natural looking blushes.",28 Jul 2021,Natural looking and effortless,SimplePractical,Anastasia,Blush,No

"The first time I used the product I used my fingers and got more of a sheer application. Then I discovered that it‚Äôs double ended with a brush! The brush is amazing and buffs out the color to perfection.  Super creamy and buildable, this has become one of my favorite blushes. I have the color soft rose and it‚Äôs great summer color and will be nice in the fall too! I too my edges of my cheeks with a little highlighter and I have the perfect summer glow with this blush. I lightly use the excess on the brush down my nose and on my chin for a sun kissed effect! Can‚Äôt wait to try more colors!!!",28 Jul 2021,Amazing Blush!,lucynicola,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I wanted this to be my blush holy grail so badly. I love the idea of a stick blush with blending brush all in one. Unfortunately, this product just doesn‚Äôt deliver. All three stars are for the blush itself which is a very deep rose shade. It‚Äôs buildable and blends beautifully. The blending brush on the end is useless.

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I usually go for powder blush but was excited to give this a try. This new Anastasia stick cream blush comes with a built-in brush which is fabulous! It‚Äôs as soft as everyone says it is, and makes it easy to blend the cream without messing up any makeup you have on underneath. The blush itself is very buildable which I love. The texture is very lightweight but, I do think it might be too heavy for me if I build it up a lot, given that it‚Äôs summer in South Florida at the moment. It‚Äôs fine if I use a small amount however, and the finish is lovely and natural looking. I‚Äôll probably stick to powder blush during the height of summer but will definitely check out the other shades for other times of the year.",28 Jul 2021,Lovely cream blush!,sarahrob2248,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I am obsessed with cream blushes but haven‚Äôt found the perfect formula (creamy but blends like a powder, long wear, doesn‚Äôt need to be set with a powder on top etc) this one checks all the boxes. This shade is a neutral vibrant pink and looks good on top of foundation or not. Absolute win in my book. Yes I was gifted this product by influenster to test out but I totally would have purchased it when it was released cuz there are not many cream blush sticks on the market I love like this one!",28 Jul 2021,"Yes, just yes, add to cart you won‚Äôt regret it",jillmichele,Anastasia,Blush,No

"So I got the shade soft rose which was the perfect color for my skin tone, the stick blush itself is very creamy, very pigmented and very easy to use/apply, it blends really well and gives that natural rosy cheeks effect. I was amazed on how the stick blush provided a brush which was unexpected but a very pleasant surprise since everyone needs a to go brush!

"This product was beautifully packaged in rose gold. I loved the color, it is a nice soft rosy beige color, it went on smooth and blended nicely. I like that the color is buildable and I was able to get a understated glow or a dramatic color depending on where I was going. Only downside for me was the brush it was a little rough and hard to use with it being so small. I opted to use my own brush which is a little softer. I would definitely recommend this product.

"Very impressed with this stock blush. I love that‚Äôs it all in one, the cream blush on one end and the brush to blend it on the other. I don‚Äôt need to carry and extra brush around which is great! The stick color I got is peachy keen and it works perfectly for my tan summer skin, but I know it‚Äôll suit my winter complexion as well. It goes on smoothly and the brush helps to blend it perfectly into my cheekbones. I hate the over powered pink cheek look, but this color makes for just a sunny rosy cheek look! The brush bristles are soft and blend well. Overall super happy with this blush and brush duo combo in a compact little stick!",27 Jul 2021,Blush and brush in a stick!,Funebone,Anastasia,Blush,No

"Love this cream blush. Gives a gorgeous glow to the skin without being shimmery. With as dense as the brush is I honestly thought it would blend away the product, but it buffs it in nicely.",27 Jul 2021,Great cream blush!,emjaeyoung,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Color = Beautiful. Pigmentation is meh, but I also haven‚Äôt tried building it due the fact that it didn‚Äôt sit well with tinted moisturizer I‚Äôve tried with it and became oily throughout day. The product blended very well and I LOVE the brush built in at opposite end. I will need to try product with a standard foundation later to decide if the product didn‚Äôt like tinted moisturizer or it‚Äôs my skin type (combo) that the blush didn‚Äôt like it. 

Side note: I tried using as an eyeshadow to create a more monotone look, but it creased with eyelid primer used. I did add a few layers as I wanted to build up color, so it might just be the reason it creased. 

It can also be used as a lip color, but I have not tried that method of application to leave an honest review.

I received the color ‚ÄúLatte‚Äù which is a beautiful nude with a pink undertone. The color itself is really nice as a blush but I also think it‚Äôs versatile enough that it could work as an eyeshadow as well! The consistency of the product is soft, creamy, and airy. It feels very light on the skin but still retains the pigment very well. You can go light with it or build it up for more coverage. Lastly, there is a brush on the end!

The applicator is BEAUTIFUL (who doesn‚Äôt love rose gold?) and sturdy. I am not worried about it getting damaged rolling around in my bag or having product leak out. The blush product itself is creamy out of the tube and blends into a powdery texture. It is easy to apply and long-wearing, even under a mask in the summer!

"So this was my first time trying a cream stick blush and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs something that I will use as my go to blush. That being said, I had some things I loved about this blush and some things I was not impressed with. My favorite thing about this blush was the color and I like that it was buildable. What I didn‚Äôt like about this blush is the brush that comes built into the blush applicator is super rough on my skin and I didn‚Äôt feel like it helped blend out the product at all. I always had to use my own brush to blend it out. The other thing I didn‚Äôt like about it was that it didn‚Äôt blend out very easily and it didn‚Äôt have the creamy texture that it claims to have (in my opinion). It felt a little on the dry side.

"I received this product for free from influenster and ABH in exchange for my honest review. My first impression of the packaging was wow, this gorgeous! The actual product packaging did not feel cheep. I first applied the cream blush by dabbing a few circles near the corner of my eye and side of my cheek and I used the dual end brush to blend it out but I noticed that the product began to fade and lose its color. I reapplied more product and tried it with a damp beauty blender. I did not really feel like the beauty blender was the best applicator for this particular product either. Lastly, I applied more product and simply used the side of my fingers and the product blended beautifully! I appreciated how buildable the product was‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to defuse a strong pink blush but this blush was great because it started off as a bit ‚Äúunpigmented‚Äù in my opinion but I ended up seeing it as a great product to be able to build depending on the look I was going for. I did not apply any powder blush on top of this product because I wanted to really see the finished product and I have to say it‚Äôs so beautiful and natural looking. This Peachy Keen shade is the perfect pink/peach tone I‚Äôve been looking for! I will say there are other products I‚Äôve tried that feel a bit more pigmented than this one but only this product has really nailed the perfect balance of a peachy pink blush! The only thing I was really not a fan of was the dual end brush. It felt rough on my skin and it almost felt like it made the product disappear as I used it to blend into my skin. I definitely recommend this product, and really commend ABH for this beautiful shade!

If I‚Äôm being honest though, I‚Äôm not in love with the included brush. However, it‚Äôs no problem because of course I have my own that work much better for application.",27 Jul 2021,The best cream blush stick,Oransii,Anastasia,Blush,No
Love this application! I received the color Latte and thought it would be too dark for my liking but after wearing it I think the color is perfect! I get so many compliments when wearing it. It applies even and the brush it had attached makes it easy to blend. Will def order more colors.,27 Jul 2021,Love this blush!,VictoriaJ89,Anastasia,Blush,No
Okay this product is amazing. It‚Äôs so buttery smooth and blends super well. The brush on the other end is very soft and blends the blush out nicely without picking up too much product. My mom also tried this and loved it so much she bought her own. I‚Äôve never tried any Anastasia blushes before but this is one of my favs for sure. It is a pretty deep rosy color so I wasn‚Äôt sure how it would look on my fairer skin but it looked very natural.,27 Jul 2021,,ShelbyPadgett12,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I was very excited to receive the ABH stick blush in pink dahlia. First off, I thought the packaging was very pretty and it looks awesome displayed on my makeup shelf. I found it somewhat easy to apply to my cheeks, but it did seem to accentuate more pores on my cheeks if I didn‚Äôt put a primer or other makeup under it. Cons - the brush is VERY scratchy, like so scratchy that I will never use it on my face again, so that is a bummer. I have one other stick blush with an attached brush, and that one in comparison is super soft. I also did not think the texture of this product was suitable for my lips. I was disappointed that it applied very patchy. Overall, I really want to love this blush, but since I rarely wear medium or full coverage foundation, this particular product did not seem to do much for my cheeks or lips. Also, given how abrasive the brush was on my face, I‚Äôm not sure I would recommend the product until this feature is improved.",27 Jul 2021,,LibbyLu4311,Anastasia,Blush,No
"The Anastasia Beverly Hills cream blush is really nice. The rose gold packaging is so pretty. The blush itself is a lovely texture. It applies so smoothly and is very creamy without feeling heavy. It is definitely buildable and lasts all day. The only qualm I have is that it‚Äôs not a clean formula, so it did aggravate my very sensitive, eczema prone skin. I‚Äôll probably only use it on special occasions because I‚Äôm afraid that if I use it long term it will cause a more serious flare. It would be perfect for someone without sensitive skin.",27 Jul 2021,"Lovely, but‚Ä¶",LaraGrog,Anastasia,Blush,No

"These amazing blush sticks are undoubtedly the best product of Summer 2021! I already have numerous blush sticks in my makeup collection but this product was screaming out for me to try it. Of course I did and boy am I glad! I initially purchased one in the shade Latte and fell in love. The packaging is great as there is a blending brush on the opposite end of the blush. It makes it SO easy to use especially when you‚Äôre in a rush or on the go. The blush is creamy, goes on easily, blends so nicely, and it‚Äôs so easy to apply. Plus, the shades are beautiful for summer. I ended up purchasing four different shades AND I use the same shade of blush on my lips! Yeah, really! My fave is Peachy Keen. So after I apply the blush to my cheeks and blend it in, I then go to my lips which I line with a fairly neutral lip liner then I use the blush shade Peachy Keen and lightly tap it all over my lips. I‚Äôm just transferring the shade very lightly to my lips. Lastly, I place a spot of clear sparkly lip gloss at the center of my bottom lip and POW! Absolutely stunning!!! You will not be disappointed!!!",27 Jul 2021,BEST PRODUCT OF SUMMER 2021!!!,DoctorLevyMD,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I‚Äôm in love with this stick brush. The Pink Dhalia color is so gorgeous, a lovely tone of pink that works great with my medium complexion. While I appreciate how practical the stick format is, I feel that it doesn‚Äôt last as long as a powder blush. But it is okay - the format makes it easy to reapply on the go. There‚Äôs even a convenient brush on the other side of the stick. The creamy formula glides easily on the skin, and the brush helps spread it to achieve a natural look.",27 Jul 2021,"Creamy formula, great for on the go",gabizago,Anastasia,Blush,No

"This product is perfect for on-the-go. It comes in a gorgeous metallic case with the stick blush on one end and a brush on the other. The solid formula means no loose powder dusting everything in your toiletry bag. I used the peachy keen shade, which worked well on my Asian skin which has warm undertones. The blush was easy to apply and went on smoothly. Coverage was buildable which I liked. What kept the product from being a 5/5 was the fact that it wasn‚Äôt very easy to blend. The product says you can use your fingers to blend it in to your skin, but I found that you really need to use the brush to blend it. Just using your fingers usually leaves portions not fully blended. I‚Äôve used the milk stick blush before and it blended much more easily. That being said, since the ABH stick comes with a brush that‚Äôs not a dealbreaker and I will continue to happily use it.",26 Jul 2021,,IYOl,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I received this complimentary from ABH and Influenster for an honest review. 
I received the color Latte, which I think may show up better on a lighter skin tone. I have medium toned skin, and it just gives a subtle wash, which I don‚Äôt mind. It has a nice creamy application, and doesn‚Äôt tug on my skin, and blends easily. I appreciate the brush on the other end of the stick, which is soft and screws off for easy cleaning. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd really use the brush side often but it‚Äôs convenient for on the go. The color doesn‚Äôt last all day unless I wear a primer and set it with a setting spray.

"For a person who is definitely a powder blush, matte finish kind of gal this is a great product. The color is gorgeous and blends really well when a firm brush is taken to the product then to the face.

Would use more if I was more of a dewy to natural finish fan, but will continue to use and set with a powder blush for my personal preference.",25 Jul 2021,,RhodyMiaC,Anastasia,Blush,No

"Seriously the best blush I‚Äôve ever used! I just dot some on my cheeks and tap it into place as directed with the brush on the other end and in no time I have a beautifully natural looking flush of color to my cheeks. It blends beautifully, the texture of this product just looks like natural skin, a little bit goes a long way so I know I‚Äôll have this product for a while even with daily use, and the price is pretty standard when I need to replace it. I got this product for free to review from Influenster and I‚Äôm so happy I got to try it out and that they sent me the perfect shade. This is my new favorite makeup product and it really excites me to use it.

"OMG this blush is the one! The Anastasia Beverly Hills Stick Blush is so creamy but so lightweight at the same time, it melts over the skin making it so easy to blend. The color is well pigmented and looks so beautiful. The best part is that this blush is oil free, so it doesn't make my makeup heavier and is cruelty free.

I received this product for testing purposes from influencer.",24 Jul 2021,,ElRey,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I‚Äôll start off by saying I love the color of this blush, and I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. It looks very beautiful and natural on my skin tone. However, the performance of it is all in how you apply it in my experience. When blending it out with the brush it comes with, I got patches. When applying it with a beauty blender, I found that it disappeared. I had an easier time applying it with my own brush on one cheek, but on the other side it got patchy. I feel like this is something that needs to be warmed up on the back of the hand, lightly dabbed on with fingers or a blush brush, and built up slowly. I also found that the wear is good when it‚Äôs set with either another blush or just a powder in general. This may not be something I reach for when I‚Äôm in a hurry and it won‚Äôt be in my everyday routine, but it‚Äôs a good travel product and a decent introduction to cream/stick products!",24 Jul 2021,,fayzah,Anastasia,Blush,No

This is such a beautiful color.  It only took a couple of strokes to show up on my skin. I finally found a blush that works with my skin tone. You can wear this by itself or with a full face of makeup.  When I applied this on my skin without makeup, it completely melted onto my skin. It is so creamy and gave my skin an amazing glow.

"I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this cream blush as I‚Äôve never found one I quite liked. This one not only blends like a dream but it doesn‚Äôt make your skin sticky or tacky feeling and it doesn‚Äôt sit on top of the skin but absorbs into the skin. The color I received is also my perfect blush shade, which is hard for me to find as I don‚Äôt like ones that are too peachy or orange or too pink. This one is very natural and gives a nice glow from within flush of color without any shine or shimmer and not too matte. I can even apply this over powders if I want to set my foundation. The brush it comes with is nice for on the go however I do prefer to use my own brush to blend it out. That being said tho, I think this blush is a 10 out of 10 from packaging to color and formula.

Love the shade and creaminess of this product. I originally thought this shade would be too dark on my fair skin but it was a nice rich color. The texture is very creamy and it blends in to my skin easily. It has a nice shine and glow after applying. It‚Äôs not too shiny but gives a dewey look. The other side of the stick has a brush but I personally use it it dab the edges a bit and then use a sponge to completely blend out. The brush makes it fade a bit more. I did use some of this on my nose as well and it looked a bit more natural. Would recommend for anyone trouble blending in blush or finding something a bit more dewey and natural.,24 Jul 2021,Blends smoothly,sharbear222,Anastasia,Blush,No

The Anastasia Beverly Hills Stick Blush is very pigmented and the color is similar to the NARS orgasm blush.

I was really impressed by this. its very buildable- so you can adjust how intense you want it. you can either dab lightly on or make a fill stripe and use the included brush to blend it out.

Very convenient with it being a stick and having a blending brush at the other end. The brush is super soft and blends very well. It did not clog my pores or irritate. This fits right in with all of my other makeup products. Defiantly my new favorite and will continue to use. I used this only as a blush but it is full coverage for me so I can use it for my lip.

It‚Äôs become a purse staple for me. I was given this for free to try from influenster.,22 Jul 2021,I love this stick and brush,nicolecno,Anastasia,Blush,No

"It‚Äôs easy to write a review about Anastasia Beverly Hills‚Äôs products for me, because I LOVE so much this brand. I received as a free sample that product and it was one more good surprise. Now, we have a lot of cream blush/lip products in the market, but I thought this product easy to blending, creamy and after wore mask the blush was there.

"The Anastasia Beverly Hills Blush stick is a creamy, lightweight blush. The color I was given, Peachy Keen,  is just a bit too orange for my skin tone. Aside from that, the blush stick is easy to apply. I still used a blush brush to apply on to my cheeks. The color absorbs into the skin and has a nice shimmer to it. 
I also really love the rose-gold tube the stick is in. very pretty.",22 Jul 2021,"Creamy, shimmer blush stick",SoCalMomof2,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I really love this blush stick! I received this from Influenster, and it has been my favorite makeup product of the summer! The latte shade gives just a touch of natural glow to my light skin tone. My preferred way to use this product is by taking off the brush from the end and dabbing some of the product on the brush to apply to my cheeks. I found this to give a very natural, small pop of color, as I dont like to wear much makeup during the summer. I also love 
applying it to my eyelids, using my fingers. It adds just a perfect amount of shimmer and stays on throughout the day!!!",22 Jul 2021,,Saxymanda,Anastasia,Blush,No
"To preface this, I‚Äôm typically not a fan of cream products. With saying that, I really like this product! The formula is easy to work with. It‚Äôs also buildable if you want a more intense blush look. I find that it blends out best with my finger or a sponge. The brush on the end if kind of pointless and they should rethink having it on there to make room for more product. I like to set mine with a powder blush because I do find it fades fairly quickly if you don‚Äôt",22 Jul 2021,,sarahxoxo15,Anastasia,Blush,No
I‚Äôve really enjoyed using this on days when I really don‚Äôt want to do much. A little concealer and this blush and I‚Äôm ready to go!

"I really like this blush stick, it‚Äôs super creamy and easy to apply. The color ‚Äúlatte‚Äù is rosy with a bronzy undertone that gives me that slightly-sunburnt look on my light/olive skin. It‚Äôs really natural, and you don‚Äôt need to apply a ton. For my normal/combination skin, I noticed several hours of wear except when I applied using the brush. The brush is way too stiff and pretty much useless, it takes off the product from my cheeks. I much prefer using my fingers. I received this product complimentary from Influenster.",22 Jul 2021,"Great creamy blush, brush is useless",Reigan,Anastasia,Blush,No
"First off I want to say I really love cream blush especially in the summer when I‚Äôm looking for a little more of a natural look. I have the shade pink dahlia in this blush and it‚Äôs such a pretty color, it‚Äôs a perfect pink flush on my fair skin. The blush can be built up if you want a more intense blush of sheered out for a more subtle blush, both ways look great. The packaging on this stick blush is super cute, blush stick on one end and a small brush on the other end (the brush is great for touch ups and on the go, but won‚Äôt replace your preferred blush brush when you‚Äôve got that option). I think this is a solid option for people who want to try cream blush or prefer cream blush, these remind me of the NARS multiple sticks but creamier if you‚Äôve ever used those.",22 Jul 2021,"Easy to use, pretty color!",mary783,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I‚Äôve had some bad experiences with stick blushes so I was hesitant about this one. I‚Äôve been converted. I received this free for review and they sent the color  Peachy Keen. The color goes on smoothly and is incredibly blendable and buildable. The color works wonderfully with my neutral skin tone and adds a beautiful blush of color that looks natural and gives my skin a healthy glow.

"At first glance, the color (Latte) is GORGEOUS and I absolutely loved the little brush attached at the other end of the stick. I will say this product definitely had a bit of a learning curve for me, at first when applying directly from the stick I found that it went on way too heavy and was hard to blend out no matter what I used. However after playing around with it, I found that the brush on the end actually screws off (!!) so you can pick up product with it or unscrew it for cleaning which I think is awesome. Applying the product with the brush or even picking some up with your fingers and tapping it out gives a gorgeous blendable finish that made me fall in love with the product. The color is perfect with my skin tone, I would likely buy this product again.",21 Jul 2021,,beeedub,Anastasia,Blush,No

"This is not a copy of Mario, it‚Äôs a copy of Nudestix Matte.  Almost exactly- right down to the colors and brush.  It‚Äôs not at all dewy, which is what I was hoping.  And the color I got- Peach Caramel- is an almost exact copy of Nudestix Sunkissed or Deep Mapke, Eh- which are super similar to each other.  It‚Äôs nothing like the Mario Blush Stick, which I love but needs warmer colors.  Too bad, I was hoping to love this.  In the pic the middle one is the Anastasia Peach Caramel.

I really love this actually. But I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the brush on the other side. It‚Äôs nice to throw in your purse, but not an ideal every morning brush. The biggest thing, is being it‚Äôs a creme product, it‚Äôs not ideal for oily skin. I find it can look greasy, fast if you‚Äôre in hot weather.

"I received this complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I normally only use powder blushes because it‚Äôs so easy to dab and brush out, but this one really changed my mind about cream or stick blushes! I like that it‚Äôs dual-ended that comes with a mini brush so that I don‚Äôt have to use my finger or look for another brush to blend it out. This is so convenient. I can carry it on the go and when I travel. The shade Soft Rose which, just like its name, is a neutral deep rose shade that should be flattering on everyone. It‚Äôs very pigmented and at first I swiped on too much but it‚Äôs easily sheered out with the brush and some setting powder. It‚Äôs fairly long lasting on me too.

"Love this blush stick in Latte! Latte is a beautiful, subtle rose with brown undertones that gives me the perfect no-makeup makeup look, which is my go-to these days. The rosy-brown tint is not muddy at all (which I was afraid of, looking at the dark swatches online). It works well with my skin tone (neutral light to light-medium) and, even with my slight summer tan, Latte wears as a very pretty, natural pink, adding just a bit of warmth and dimension to my complexion. (See the pics for an arm swatch as well as the blended blush below the swatch.) I like to wear it over just sunscreen during these hot CA summer days.

The formula is foolproof as well: goes on creamy, and not sticky at all; after blending, dries down and stays put for about four hours (longevity is not the best, but it's easy to pop in my purse and reapply as needed). Great for busy mornings!

I love my blinged-out blush sets and vibrant blushes, but this everyday-staple blush stick has won my heart as well.",20 Jul 2021,So Pretty. Blush Love!,comboskinview,Anastasia,Blush,No

It has a brush at one end to assist in blending in or you can just swipe on lightly and work in with your fingers. I personally appreciated the brush they provided even if it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúbest‚Äù brush but great when on the go or in a hurry.

The color was a little bit red for my skin tone but after a while I look more natural and it stayed on the entire day I‚Äôm really impressed and I definitely recommend it.,20 Jul 2021,Awesome,LEO81,Anastasia,Blush,No

This is a pretty cool product. It has the brush on one end and the product on the other. I took one star away because it didn't seem to last all day on my face snd this product seemed ver rich. Decent product and very efficient but not too long lasting.,20 Jul 2021,Efficient product with brush snd blush.,liaphilly,Anastasia,Blush,No
I love this blush. It is the perfect color with my skin tone. The application is so easy with the built in brush and it leaves your cheeks dewy and beautiful!,20 Jul 2021,,12lex,Anastasia,Blush,No
I received the shade Latte and it‚Äôs PERFECT if you like a more neutral pinky brown shade. Looks amazing on my light to light/medium skin. So far it seems to be long lasting and does not remove foundation when applied. It‚Äôs probably my favorite cream blush product that I‚Äôve tried so far!,20 Jul 2021,Obsessed,KatEmor,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I received this blush complementary from #Influenster to test out in exchange for my honest opinion. The packaging is absolutely beautiful and perfectly sized to carry in my purse. The color is Peach caramel and stunning on! Truly melts into your skin for a seamless dewy finish. So easy to apply and very buildable while still looking natural. 
I applied to my cheeks and ended building it up even more once my makeup was done, even slightly went over my nose for a fresh flushed look, it worked so nicely with the rest of my makeup. I also applied a little to my lips to give them a little of bit of color and worked well on lips as well. The brush which is included on the other end of the blush stick is not the best brush but is still functional when on the go. I preferred using my fingers to slowly build it up. I would definitely recommend this #ABHStickBlush to anyone looking for a new blush, it is gorgeous!",20 Jul 2021,,zamanR,Anastasia,Blush,No
This blush is awesome! The formula is so rich and creamy. I love that it comes with a blender brush so you can easily get a natural look. This shade is perfect for my medium beige skin.

Love love love this cream stick blush. It‚Äôs long wearing lightweight and multifunctional. I use this as a light lip paired with gloss or alone for a satin finish.

"Cream blushes are really having a moment lately, so new ones need to be really good to stand out. This one is just all right to me. The packaging is nice! It has a heavy feel, the rose gold color is super sleek and trendy, and I love that there is a brush in the other end. This shade (Peach Caramel) is gorgeous. I have medium warm olive skin and it just looks so natural and bronzey on me. The main problem I have with this product is that I don‚Äôt find it to be very creamy or blendable. Fingers actually work better than the brush to spread the product and help it meld with your skin. I find the formula overall to be kind of dry, stiff, and not that user friendly. If you have oily skin, this might be a good thing for you. But for me with dry skin, I just don‚Äôt think this formula plays nicely.",20 Jul 2021,fine but not a standout,harlotry,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I am so glad I received this sample through VoxBox on Influenster!  I do occasionally wear blush, but sparingly as most power blushes dry my skin out and cream blushes rub off quickly (even with primer & setting spray).  First, the packaging here is fantastic!  I love the rose gold case - very sturdy and perfect for a travel makeup bag.  At first I was skeptical about the blending brush. What you see in the image is the extent of the brush.  It's very firm and doesn't fan, but it blended PERFECTLY!  I had an absolutely flawless application that looked perfectly soft and natural. The best part?  It actually lasted all day!  Again, I'm thrilled to have discovered Anastasia Beverly Hills Stick Cream Blush.  It's definitely going in my permanent beauty arsenal.",20 Jul 2021,Best cream blush I've ever used!  Love this!!,rayestephens,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I have always been a powder blush girl, but apparently it's just because I hadn't found the right stick blush! The color seems intense at first swipe, but blends in seamlessly.

"This blush is very easy to apply and blend with the attached brush. It goes on very bright initially, but blends well to a subtle, flattering shade.

I received the stick blush in the shade pink dahlia. The color is phenomenal and applies so smooth. It is a dream to blend and felt so natural on my skin.

I received this product through influenster and I'm so glad I did. I have always loved abh products and this one is no exception. The packaging is beautiful and convenient with a brush on one and and the blush stick on the other. The blush itself has a super creamy texture and it glides on to the skin smoothly without streaking or getting patchy. The color is subtle but buildable and leaves a natural color on your cheeks.

I am getting more and more into cream products. This blush is very pigmented and blends very well! This is the first stick blush I‚Äôve tried. I swiped a bit on my cheek and blended with my blush brush. The color works well for my summer skin tone but may be dark in the winter. I plan to snag another color or two of this as I am very happy with it. I received this complementary.,20 Jul 2021,5 Stars!,heathermartin79,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Really great cream product. Easy to blend, the peach is a really neutral shade that looks nice on my fair skin. I am not a fan of the brush on the stick, I would just use a stiff foundation brush or a kabuki to blend it out. Overall I would consider repurchasing",20 Jul 2021,highly recommend,C41T,Anastasia,Blush,No
I really love this blush! It goes on as a super lightweight cream blush. The blush is buildable depending on if you want a soft radiant glow or want a bright blush color. I got the color Pink Dahia. It was perfect for my light olive skin tone. I found this product long-wearing (it lasted me all day). I had no skin sensitivity problems with it or breakouts with this product. I think this is a great blush for all skin tones. I found it easiest to blend with your fingers.,20 Jul 2021,My New Favorite,BeautyGuroo262,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I absolutely LOVED this product. It‚Äôs super light weight and was so easy to apply. The brush was a nice touch as well. I used it with and without foundation and really liked the way it layered and looked both ways. It was extremely easy to apply, but wasn‚Äôt as creamy as I expected it to be from the descriptions. It is incredibly blendable, though.",19 Jul 2021,Give it a try,heatherleanne,Anastasia,Blush,No

I really enjoyed using this blush. at first I thought this color will not look right on my skin but after blending it in a compliments my cheeks and add definition to my cheekbones. it does not irritate my skin and lashes throughout the day. it goes on smooth and just not cake up or dry out.,19 Jul 2021,Nice and smooth!,Priceless34,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I really like cream blushes instead of powder. This looks really good on my skin, it blends really nicely. I didn‚Äôt like the brush it removed some of my foundation.

I like it as blush, lip color, and eye shadow.",19 Jul 2021,Great product,dmf031,Anastasia,Blush,No

"This is an incredible blush! I've tried many cream blushes and this is the best. It's creamy, has a beautiful pigment and blends beautifully over foundation and bare skin. The formula is easy to apply and although pink dahlia might look like a super bright pink it can be blend out from a soft pink to a vibrant one.. The color is buildable and a little goes a long way. The attached brush is wonderful at blending and buffing out the color. I'm so impressed with this product.",19 Jul 2021,The best cream blush on the market,TCabrera4,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I received this blush complementary from #influencer to test out in exchange for my honest opinion. Upon opening the box the gold package is elegant. When the tube of blush slid out I hate to say it but it‚Äôs the prettiest makeup in my collection now. I like the stick blush with blender as well. This is my first of this kind past an ELF highlighter which I used as blush. Application was easy as well as blending. I have hand issues and it was large enough to hold, grasp, apply pressure on, and blend with. The brush attached on the other end was surprisingly easy to use. It did not over absorb the makeup and spread it well. It did not drag on my skin pulling it either. I like the subtle blush it left and the fact that if I keep applying it it will be more pigmented. Now that I am exposed to her wonderful products I am sure I will stay with this as my go to blush. I guess a few more shades would be nice. This gave me a very natural look which I am liking in my older age. The everyday look for me is natural and it was so easy to apply I can see people who like blush really like this product. I am honestly blown away and they have gained a fan. Maybe when i need to replace this stick they will have a few more colors :) One can hope! I would recommend this item to people I know. I attached a picture of the blush on my clean skin or natural and then another swatch of one heavy swipe.",19 Jul 2021,I really liked this blush. Great for on the go too,lunabeeee,Anastasia,Blush,No
Super easy to apply! I love that it has a brush on another end which makes it super easy to blend and apply during the day. Perfect to keep in the purse. The color came out beautifully. The creamy texture is nice and melts into the skin. The color is buildable and easy to blend. The soft rose shade goes perfectly with my neutral everyday looks.,19 Jul 2021,Love! My new fave!,Eins101,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Let me start off my saying, the actual product is wonderful. It‚Äôs a true cream to powder and blends absolutely beautifully. It‚Äôs such a great opacity that is easily buildable but is not overwhelming and sticky like some similar blush products. The color that I used is absolutely wonderful on my fair skin and doesn‚Äôt apply heavily out of the tube. It lasts for hours, and is now my go to blush. 

The downside is the brush that comes with it. It‚Äôs convenient that it‚Äôs at the bottom of the tube but the brush is so tiny and the hair are so short that it does a terrible job of blending the product. I think if people just used that brush they would be unhappy with the product overall. However, using a regular brush this product just shines.",19 Jul 2021,Awesome product but terrible brush,cynmrose12,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Let me start off by saying if your looking for a sun kiss look this summer, then you definitely need this blush to finish the touch!  I‚Äôm a blush junkie and when I received this blush I knew I couldn‚Äôt wait to try it out! The blush stick is very easy to apply, it‚Äôs very cream and easy to spread onto your cheeks!  I‚Äôm obsessed with cream blush and love peachy colors.  Of course this blush goes on light at first but if you want that more peachy tone then definitely apply more.  I would recommend this blush but it‚Äôs a must have for this hot girl summer!",19 Jul 2021,Perfect blush stick,BrittanyNoel,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I love this new blush stick from Anastasia Beverly Hills! I was already a fan of Ilia's blush stick but this one seems to have longer lasting pigment than that or even my regular powder blushes. Personally prefer using my fingers to blend; the provided brush seems to remove too much of the blush no matter how gently I try to blend it. And I love the rose color, it's very flattering!",19 Jul 2021,,katG1420,Anastasia,Blush,No
"This blush is my new obsession, I usually never go for cream blush, but after trying this cream blush I will never go back. The formula is nice and creamy, easy to blend.

"Wow! I really loved receiving this product and knew I would fall in love! The packaging is beautiful and the product works amazing! I received to color Peach Caramel and it was the perfect compliment on my skin shade. This blush applies like butter and blends incredibly! I would definitely purchase other colors!

"This blush is dreamy! An absolute summer win. The formula is so light weight it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre wearing anything heavier than moisturizer. There is a decent amount of product for the price. The compact is on the go friendly as well. You can easily throw it in your purse or pocket. I will definitely be buying the other shades. 
My only complaint about this product is the brush. I don‚Äôt quite understand it. I didn‚Äôt think he blended the product very easily. I much preferred my wet beauty blender.",18 Jul 2021,summer must have,a123e010,Anastasia,Blush,No
I really liked this product the packaging is so pretty and the product goes on very smoothly. I like to use it with a dewy foundation it glides on easily.

"I wanted to love this product but I just couldn‚Äôt. I received the shade ( PINK DAHLIA) .. and if I‚Äôm being honest the packaging and color is gorgeous, the product itself I was disappointed in. It is very hydrating‚Ä¶but I found it hard to apply. The color glided on well but blending out was a lot harder than I thought. I‚Äôve tried it two ways: one with my finger, the other with the brush provided. Both ways proved disappointing. Both ways seemed to remove the product off more. I also found the color didn‚Äôt last as long on my face and I had to reapply throughout my day. It was such a beautiful color but this product just wasn‚Äôt my favorite.",17 Jul 2021,cream blush stick,Rosewynn,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I received this for free from Influenster for my honest review. I received the color soft rose. This is a beautiful product. It blends very nice and melts into the skin. I didn‚Äôt use the brush on the end because it was a little stiff,but with a beauty sponge it turns out amazing. I absolutely love this and you can go light or a little more dramatic because it is build able. I also like that it‚Äôs packaging because you can literally put it in your hand bag and keep it handy. I would definitely recommend this especially if you love to use cream blush and contour.",17 Jul 2021,Beautiful,genalarson,Anastasia,Blush,No
The blush stick went on very smooth and blended in nicely! The color was very subtle for my skin tone which I liked. Can‚Äôt wait to use it more and gain more confidence in using it.,17 Jul 2021,"Smooth application, nice color",katelynnhild5,Anastasia,Blush,No
I was very impressed by the Anastasia Beverly hills blush stick. It works beautifully on dark skin without looking silly. I found the application smooth and it glided on like a dream. It added a gorgeous subtle pop of peach color to my cheeks. I felt glamorous wearing the blush. It looked just as good in broad daylight as in my bathroom. I would definitely purchase the product again and recommend it to friends.,17 Jul 2021,My new favorite blush!,Nickycola,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I was super excited to try this because I think cream blushes can be really nice but they can also be drying and hard to smooth out. In the past, I‚Äôve had a hard time getting color payoff and it took a lot of product. Not with this! It‚Äôs hydrating, easy to manipulate over your cheeks and the pigment is everything! It literally melts into your skin! I‚Äôm rather fair and even with great pigment, it isn‚Äôt intimidating. I honestly haven‚Äôt even tried the brush yet. I just use my finger. Talk about convenient! I love the color (Peachy Keen) and hope they come out with more shades! This leaves the most beautiful glow on my cheeks and compliments my skin making it look even healthier. It‚Äôs a great color and product for year round wear. The packaging is also 10/10.",17 Jul 2021,Gorgeous Color!,BloggerDanielle,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I absolutely love the packaging on this product. Having the applicator built in makes it so easy to use on the go. I added this straight to my summer routine bag that's simple and easy to do after a day at the beach. I wish the product had a little more longevity. It easily rubs right into the skin, which is great for blendability but not great for building up the color . Overall loved this product and could see it in my day to day routine!!",17 Jul 2021,Easy summer add on!!,HisIck,Anastasia,Blush,No
I absolutely love the ABH stick cream blush. It is very creamy and pigmented. The color is beautiful on my skin tone. Since I have received it I have added it to my everyday look. On my skin tone it contours beautifully and I take it a across my nose lightly for a blurred filter look. It‚Äôs very easy to apply but highly pigmented so be sure to build it lightly. The only thing I didn‚Äôt love is the brush on the other end. It kind of sweeps the product right off so I used my own brush and blender ball. Would love to have this stick without the brush and a bigger version because the color is gorgeous!,17 Jul 2021,New Favorite Staple Item,CoCoMonet,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I have been waiting for a product like this from Anastasia!! I love cream blush for both summer and winter. It‚Äôs so versatile, doesn‚Äôt dry out my skin, and I LOVE that the brush and product is all in one. It‚Äôs perfect for travel and every day use. The color is also a great summer look! I look forward to trying some of the more mauve/purple tones in the winter.",17 Jul 2021,100% yes!,Eveyy17,Anastasia,Blush,No
I really like this blush and formula. It works well over cream and most powder products. Nice buildable color and doesn‚Äôt come off looking crazy. The brush seems a little useless as the shape of it doesn‚Äôt really work for blush but the actual blush is really nice.,17 Jul 2021,,LizzieChrystie,Anastasia,Blush,No
I love how soft and smooth this blush applies! Also the rosey shade blends perfectly with my skin tone. Other bonuses with this would have to be the convenient built in brush and compact size. Great for travel or on the go!,17 Jul 2021,Love it!,emk219008,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I must say that I really like this blush! When it comes to blushes in stick form I always used the Milk Makeup blush but found it to be a little too greasy, that is not the case with this blush! It‚Äôs actually super super light on the skin and blends beautifully even with finger application. The pigment is amazing so you don‚Äôt need too much! This blush has a velvety/natural finish with a thin consistency and it has no scent and is pretty long wearing. The brush on the other end is also a plus if you travel with makeup a lot, so a separate brush is one less thing to worry about! The shade I received is Soft Rose which is perfect for medium-tan skin. I really like this blush so far! It‚Äôs a yes for me!",17 Jul 2021,Yessss!!,GiLooks,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I am in love with this blush! It gives your cheeks a subtle flush that looks very natural. The color and texture are very buildable, so you can create a beautiful, natural-looking light flush of color if desired, or build up a stronger look for the evening. It gives me a very beautiful, healthy, radiant glow.",17 Jul 2021,,TraceyHu,Anastasia,Blush,No
I received this product from Influenster and absolutely loved it!! It is just the perfect shade and is so smooth and easy to blend out. The stick doesn‚Äôt pull on your skin when you apply it which usually happens with stick blushes but not this one!,17 Jul 2021,amazing!,kariinaaaaaaa,Anastasia,Blush,No
This is easy to blend out and the formula is very creamy. This shade (peach caramel) is perfect for more tan skin tones. The packaging is so beautiful; it‚Äôs a rose gold color and feels expensive.

I love this blush! Creamy and easy to blend what more can a girl want!,17 Jul 2021,,christianmorris,Anastasia,Blush,No
Such an amazing blush! I just swipe it once on each cheek and then use the built in brush to blend. The formula really works. I'm impressed that it doesn't smunge my foundation underneath. It goes on supeeasy and creamy and keepz my face soft (sometimes powder blush just looks flat and dry) and dewy. Peachy keen is a soft light yet buildable color. It's not too pinky or bronzy just perfect happy summer cheeks. The golden aplicator looks luxurious and is easy to throw in a handbag. Great product to use when leaving office to go on a dinner date. I love the quality of Anastasia and will definetely keep using this blush!,17 Jul 2021,Beautiful creamy easy to apply amazing blush!,BiancaLeo,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I am absolutely loving this blush in the shade Pink Dahlia! The color and formula is reminiscent of my current holy grail cream blush from a different company, and if it wasn't for the huge price difference, this one would replace it. Super easy to apply (in fact, too easy to over apply but thanks to the built in brush you could blend/sheer it out the way you like it). Wearability throughout the day was excellent - pictures do not do the color payoff justice as it looks wonderfully natural in person. Once I finish the product, I'll definitely be keeping the brush component to reuse, as it is quite soft and comes in handy the way the packaging provides it's own cover - great for traveling! As far as purchasing in the future, I'll have to wait for either a sale or perhaps if I have been given a Sephora gift card, this may make it into my cart...If price is not a factor in your purchasing power, would recommend this blush in a heartbeat if you're in the market for a cream brush.",17 Jul 2021,New Holy Grail Blush? Perhaps!,WendyfromCali,Anastasia,Blush,No
Loved this new stick blush from the packaging to the application to the look! Super easy to apply and blended right into my skin. It was beautifully packaged with the rose gold colors and added the perfect rose gold hint to my cheeks. Felt a little thick on my face but I still loved it and will definitely be using this in my makeup routine.,17 Jul 2021,,bellabee003,Anastasia,Blush,No
I really like the color and creaminess of this blush. It‚Äôs so pretty and great for summer. Offers a good amount of color with just one swipe. My only complaint is that the brush missed the mark for me. It‚Äôs super short and small and I think it‚Äôs easier just using my fingers to blend.,17 Jul 2021,,danieller314,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I received this from Influenster‚Ä¶ I am absolutely a dedicated fan. The color is buildable, I use just enough to have a bloom of color. I wear very dramatic eye makeup so cheeks are kept minimal. I have used both the brush that it comes with and a neoprene sponge. The brush is better for concentrated areas and the sponge spreads the product out easier. 
I also got all day wear out of this while working on my truck in 90 degree heat with a high humidity index. I will also be taking this for a summer car show where I will be in the sun again. It layered so well over my sunscreen and the brush at the bottom makes it so perfect for traveling!",17 Jul 2021,Forever dedicated,crissydahl,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I haven‚Äôt loved cream blushes historically, but this one is really nice. It‚Äôs very creamy and gives nice coverage/pigmentation, and the brush on the other end makes blending it after application super easy. The peachy color gives a lovely and natural flushed look, and is the perfect shade for summer. I‚Äôve been wearing it all day and am very happy with the staying power this has. I definitely will be adding this to my everyday makeup regimen, as I never go without my blush.",17 Jul 2021,,EmilyV1989,Anastasia,Blush,No
This stick was perfect! It glides through easily. Love the natural but bold color of Soft Rose. This brand is really good for sensitive skin. Blush sticks are good as you can apply it directly and easily. I highly recommend this one!,17 Jul 2021,,Bnewyorkerrev,Anastasia,Blush,No
I really enjoyed this blush  Beautiful creamy and easy to blend  I think this shade was perfect for my fair skin. I also enjoyed the packaging.,17 Jul 2021,Love this creamy blush,MrsRambobeauty,Anastasia,Blush,No
"This product is amazing! The main things that I really enjoyed about this product is that it‚Äôs very pigmented, it‚Äôs a nice satin finish, and it‚Äôs a super creamy formula. The only thing that I had to get used to with this product was working decently fast because if you didn‚Äôt it would dry down and not be able to be blended as easily. But a huge plus about this product is I used it over my foundation and powder and it didn‚Äôt break up my foundation at all and it didn‚Äôt mix weird with the powder. So over all I‚Äôd highly recommend this product.",17 Jul 2021,,zoedare,Anastasia,Blush,No
I received this product for free to try and was very surprised. The creamy texture is amazing and blends easily maybe to easily. Feel if you use a sponge ends up blending into nothing but the brush on this applicator is perfect.

"I received Anastasia Beverly Hills Cream Blush Stick in shade Soft Rose from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.

I am a huge fan of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics. The cream blush stick is a great new product. I love that it has the product on one side and the built in brush on the other side. I also like that it is paraben and sulfate free. Not only can you use this as a blush but it also works as a lip product as well! It glides on very nicely. It is buildable so if you want a sheet look, swipe on a thin application or if you want more coverage, add more product and blend it out until you have achieved the desired look. For a fresh all over look, dab a little on the bridge of the nose and blend up into the forehead. The blush stays put once I blend it out and lasts all day until I wash my face with soap and water. This is a really great blush. It will be a staple in my makeup bag. It is so convenient to have a great quality brush built right in to the stick and there is a good amount of product on the blush side of the stick. I love this delivery method. There are a variety of shades so everyone will find the shade or shades that work well for their skin. This is also a great product for a beginner makeup user because it is so easy to use and doubles as a lip product. It is sophisticated and high quality enough for the most experienced makeup enthusiast also. I recommend Anastasia Beverly Hills Creme Blush Stick for everyone looking for a high quality blush that I radiant and lasts all day and is easy to apply. It is definitely worth splurging on this blush! Buy it...you will be happy you did!!!",17 Jul 2021,Great Cream Blush Stick and Brush from Anastasia!,Andie401,Anastasia,Blush,No

I have never used a cream blush and was nervous trying it but man it's amazing.
Goes on beautifully and the pigment is so good. 
Blended well when I used my finger.  The brush was meh.
It's so shimmery and lasted all day.",16 Jul 2021,,AprilLynn80,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I loved this color. It gave me the perfect sun kisses look I was going for! I do find the brush end to be harsh and difficult to blend resulting in me using a sponge, which is why I removed the star.

"I absolutely love this blush! I received the shade peachy keen and it‚Äôs perfect. It is easy to apply and blends easily. It‚Äôs very smooth and not streaky at all. On one end is the blush and the other is a brush, and it makes it the perfect travel product as well! It‚Äôs buildable and you are able to get as much pigment as you want. It‚Äôs one of the very few cream blushes that I own that actually lasts all day. This is definitely my new go to blush! I received this complimentary for testing.",16 Jul 2021,,kristilyn22,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I received a free sample from influenster in exchange for my review. This was my first time using a blush stick, instead of powdered blush. I love the design and how fancy it looks. I applied it in the morning and I felt by noon it wasn‚Äôt as noticeable. It‚Äôs a pretty color I just wish it would last a bit longer for me . I do love how the brush is on the other end of the stick. You don‚Äôt need another separate brush.",16 Jul 2021,Doesnt last,niqueo53,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I love the color and saturation of the blush stock, as well as the potential to use it as a multistick (cheek, lips, eyes- see my photo for an example of it on lips and cheek).

I received the peachy keen blush as a free sample in exchange doe my honest review. I have used cream blushes before that I thought I liked until I used this one! It easily glides into your face with no greasy or oily feeling. I had no trouble at all blending this into my cheeks. It also felt very light but made my face look dewy and not dry or shiny. I have used other blushes that had a more oily consistency. I also really love the color! It‚Äôs the perfect color because it‚Äôs a light but more natural color. It stayed on my face all day and I will absolutely buy this in the future! This has made me want to try other Anastasia products!!!,16 Jul 2021,I absolutely love this blush!!!,sgw1140,Anastasia,Blush,No
The formula of this is 10/10! With cream blushes now dominating the market ive had a lot of disappointments BUT THIS this is phenomenal. The formula is lightweight but creamy. Its pigmented but compliments the skin beautifully and takes hardly any effort to blend. It‚Äôs also great if you like to use blush on your nose in your makeup routine!

"I adore this blush stick, I was a bit worried about the color being too dark, but it ended up being a dupe for my favorite summer bronze-y blush. Its pretty much identical to nudestix in sunkissed, but with a hint more red / purple in it. Sunkissed can pull a bit orange on me depending on my makeup base, but not this guy. I am obsessed. It looks so natural on, I look glowy and like Ive been in the sun a little too long. Flushed. I really like the formula, its more emollient and blendable than the nudestix, so easier to use. I like setting it with a powder blush so it lasts longer. Will absolutely repurchase this once I run out of this and sunkissed. Such a great find, thanks Influenster and Anastasia for sending this over for review. Also looks super nice on the eyes, with a bit of a shimmer shadow on top. So effortless and cool and just beautiful. Also added benefit, im not sure what is up with the color or formula, but I feel it helps my freckles look better.",16 Jul 2021,Summer in a stick,MINA7777,Anastasia,Blush,No

One of my favorite blushes is the ABH Blush Trio in Peachy Love so I was very excited to try this cream option and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed! This product is highly pigmented; it‚Äôs definitely buildable but easily blends out. I also love this peach shade! If you‚Äôre a fan of cream products I would recommend trying this product out.,16 Jul 2021,,simplylillie,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I received this product for free from Influenster and ABH in exchange for my honest review. The ABH stick blush is very creamy. It blends extremely easily, does not break the foundation, is very buildable, does not feel heavy, and doesn't accentuate pores, texture, or dry patches. Pink Dahlia is such a pretty pinkish shade. This blush is for people that are intimidated by it because the pigment isn't intense is more natural. You have to build it up to get full pigmentation. The brush is of good quality, it doesn't move the foundation or leave streaks, but I think it is too small for blush. Instead of the brush, more product could have been added. Another con is that the blush faded through the day, even setting it with loose powder; It lasted for 6 hours. I think this product is good, and it does do what it claims to do, which is be seamless and a second-skin finish.",16 Jul 2021,,Mjchelle,Anastasia,Blush,No
Love this color! It‚Äôs so pretty and I think it will go with a lot of skin tones. The only thing I don‚Äôt love is the brush‚Ä¶I rather use my own but I guess if you‚Äôre on the go‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt hurt,16 Jul 2021,On the go,mich123450,Anastasia,Blush,No

Love everything about this product. Firstly the packaging is amazing.It‚Äôs a shiny rose gold. The shininess of the packaging makes it easy to spot in your drawer or in your bag. Love that this product is a two in one. The blush applicator is on one end and the brush is on the other. The consistency of the product is very creamy a little goes a long way. Unfortunately this color does not show up very well on dark skin but I like this product so much I would be willing to purchase it in a deeper shade. Took off one star due to the fact that it does not show on all skin tones.,16 Jul 2021,Nice product,Jnine55,Anastasia,Blush,No

"I received this product free from Influenster to review. That being said the opinions are mine alone. This product is great. It goes on smoothly and doesn‚Äôt feel heavy on the skin. It gives a nice soft glow of color that looks natural. I love the brush that comes on one end, it really helps diffuse the color across the cheekbones. The color also suits my skin tone really well.

I absolutely lovecrhis cream blush!! I  received this for a review from Influenster and I'm so happy I did. This blush is a gorgeous rose color and blends out so well. It's buildable and doesn't exaggerate my already large pores. I  don't really use foundation so I can't say how well it works on top of it. The only problem I had was with the brush end it seems to pick up the product instead of blending it out.,16 Jul 2021,Love the blush,aimeeC90,Anastasia,Blush,No
"So let me start by saying I don‚Äôt completely dislike this product, however it was nothing spectacular. I love cream blushes, especially sticks, but the best one I own is four dollars from a drugstore. The pink Dahlia color is a nice cool toned pink that adds a pop, and seems to last most of the day. The consistency is pretty dry which makes it hard to blend. And the packaging is pretty excessive, just too much plastic and an unnecessary brush on the end that really only serves to remove the product. I was lucky enough to receive this as a complementary product for review, but wouldn‚Äôt re-purchase unfortunately!",16 Jul 2021,not it‚Ä¶,ek85,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I am loving this blush so much that I want an urgent refill, it is easy to apply, it pigments super well and gives you a very nice and natural finish, I love that it brings its built-in brush for those days when we carry makeup in our purse and don't want to walk around carrying so many things, it mixes so well and lasts all the time",16 Jul 2021,,isma42,Anastasia,Blush,No
I have never used a stick blush before and I was skeptical. This gorgeous blush blew me away! I love this color it gives me the perfect lil pink color I need. This comes with its own brush and that blends it beautifully and a beauty blender blended it as well. This didn‚Äôt sweat off my face through a whole concert.,16 Jul 2021,Surprised and excited,calvertm,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Anastasia New Blush Stick is amazing! I was lucky to try this product out and I‚Äôm hooked. This blush stick glides on effortlessly, blends easily and melts into my skin, giving me the effects of a sun kissed glow. And let‚Äôs not forget about the packaging! It‚Äôs a beautiful rose gold tube with product on one end and surprise! surprise! A blending brush on the other end. Love it!",16 Jul 2021,It‚Äôs Like Butter!,Sadie102,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I received this product as a free trial and it is gorgeous! It glides on easy, it smooths out well I honestly like using my blush brush better than the one located inside it but, it‚Äôs a great product worth the coins! The container is a rose gold color. Absolutely beautiful! This is a convenient way to throw your blush in your purse and go! It‚Äôs totally made for summer! Oh and the pigment is perfect!",16 Jul 2021,yes please summer love!,andreae77,Anastasia,Blush,No
"Absolutely amazing! Such a creamy formula that blends beautifully. It‚Äôs a good buildable blush. The brush on the other end is so s oft and with a little help from fingers it blends the cream almost perfectly. I definitely recommend!!

"I usually use powder blushes. It‚Äôs not often I like a cream blush. I surprisingly do like this one! I liked that this has a brush attached to it to blend it in. I received the color soft rose, which was a bit too dark for my light skin. It‚Äôs fine for summer though it just looks like I‚Äôm hot from being in the sun. A little goes a long way with this!",16 Jul 2021,,Meag28,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I received this product for free from Influenster and Anastasia Beverly Hills, in exchange for my honest review. This was my first time using a stick blush and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it felt on my skin, and how easy it was to apply and blend! My skin is olive with warm undertones, so the Peachy Keen was perfect for me!! Just a little bit, gives you a cute little blush. A bit more, and it looks beautiful! I like putting a little bit over my nose, it gives me the bite frost look which I really like!! The brush is very soft and it blends it very easily! I loved that after applying it, it kinda glows! Not like sparkly but it looks really nice! You just have to try it! The packaging is also beautiful, it‚Äôs a slick rose gold color! Recommended for anyone who wants some natural high quality blush!! And don‚Äôt forget to clean it!! (The brush pops off!!)",16 Jul 2021,Natural High quality Blush!,Adriblue,Anastasia,Blush,No
"First I would like the day I love this product very much, I have already talked my sister into purchasing one. Anyways I love how light wait this blush is and it doesn‚Äôt cause any problems for oily skin which Is another pro. The application process is smooth like butter and very easy to use over all I love the design and the way it melts into the skin.",16 Jul 2021,Peach caramel blush,markleeismypapi,Anastasia,Blush,No
"I got this product as a free sample to try. I've never used any blush that wasn't powder due to oily, textured skin. I just wanna say after about a week of use that I am in LOVE with this product. It applies, blends, and wears beautifully. It fades out better than the powders I've used throughout a normal work day. I'm light/neutral and was worried about the color itself at first, but it worked great. I plan to purchase this product again when this runs out.",15 Jul 2021,Extremely surprised,JenniferA86,Anastasia,Blush,No
