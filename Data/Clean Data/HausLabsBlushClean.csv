Could Not Resist This Forumula,benefitblondie,25 Jan 2025,"I wasn‚Äôt originally in the market for a new blush, but when I swatched the HAUS LABS Color Fuse Talc-Free Blush Powder in-store, I couldn‚Äôt resist. The formula is seriously amazing ‚Äì it‚Äôs so smooth and buttery. The packaging is another highlight; I love being able to see the blush color through the clear window, which makes it super easy to choose the perfect shade every time.

The blush shades are absolutely gorgeous and give a natural, radiant flush that can be built up for more intensity. I ended up falling in love with it so much that I‚Äôm definitely going to buy more colors.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Pretty color but broke me out :(,elizabeth26,9 Dec 2024,"I wanted to love this so much but sadly it‚Äôs definitely breaking me out. A few weeks ago I cut out all products with ANY pore clogging ingredients. my skin cleared up so quickly it was incredible - but then I had a special event and thought wearing this blush for one day couldn‚Äôt have that much impact. Welp. I woke up with 3 zits on my upper cheek - ONLY where this blush was. There are a bunch of pore cloggers in here so if you notice breakouts in your blush spot, might be worth skipping this for a while!!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Travel Size ?,Adalo,2 Dec 2024,"I had to write a review bc I was so disappointed with the size. Haus Labs has many many amazing products, one of them being this blush.

Perfect fall/non-pink blush!,Brit1110,30 Oct 2024,Love this blush and formula! It‚Äôs nice to have a blush that doesn‚Äôt have a pink undertone! I like to wear this alone or on top of Hourglass Imagine. Great fall blush!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

The quality.,Lia1902,15 Oct 2024,I finally was able to get my hands on it. Although I like it and I think it is a pretty color. I'm not impressed with the packaging. It's small and it looks a bit cheap. I was expecting something high quality.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Not impressed, blotchy on bare skin.",Niseven,1 Oct 2024,"The blush is good but blotchy if I apply it on bare skin, which is how I normally wear my blush. It looks ok on top of foundation.

So good,Sarahyd,3 Sep 2024,"**Rachael Ray Nutrish Natural Premium Dry Dog Food: A Pawsitively Positive Review**

As a dedicated dog owner, I've tried countless dog food brands, but Rachael Ray Nutrish Natural Premium Dry Dog Food with Real Chicken has quickly become a favorite. This high-quality kibble offers a delicious and nutritious meal for my furry friend.

One of the things I appreciate most about this food is the high-quality ingredients. Real chicken is the first ingredient, ensuring that my dog is getting a healthy and protein-packed meal. The kibble also contains essential vitamins and minerals to support overall health and well-being.

The texture of the kibble is firm and crunchy, making it easy for my dog to chew and digest. It also helps to keep his teeth clean and healthy. The scent is pleasant and enticing, even to my human nose.

The packaging is sturdy and easy to open, making it convenient to store and serve. The clear bags allow me to easily see the contents and ensure that the food is fresh.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with Rachael Ray Nutrish Natural Premium Dry Dog Food with Real Chicken. It's a delicious, nutritious, and affordable option that I highly recommend to any dog owner.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Smaller Than The Size of 2 Postage Stamps,SeanaV,28 Aug 2024,"Waste of Good money! However, the color is pretty. The powder is nice and lightweight.

Beautiful Blush!!,kymassey,28 Aug 2024,"Love this product! I am a big fan of bright blush (blush blindness who?!) and this product later beautifully and perfectly.

Definitely must have,LocNessaMonster,20 Aug 2024,Such a pretty color! I use on all of my clients and I always get asked what blush I‚Äôm using on them. It blends very well and sits beautifully on the skin. Ôøº,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Awesome product!,,11 Aug 2024,A very good product once you get used to it. It‚Äôs such a pigmented powder blush that it can be almost hard to blend out. Other then that i absolutely love it!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Beautiful for anyone,mollycat1234,28 Jul 2024,"This a universal red blush. It‚Äôs quite pigmented, but is build-able and blend-able. This blush, while is a powder, has a luminosity to it, but has no shimmer or glitter. A very unique formula!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Perfect ‚ÄúBlonzer‚Äù,MitchDurden,25 Jul 2024,"Fire moon is just the right warm tone to give that flushed sun kissed look. It works as a blush or bronzer! Pigment payoff is great, a light hand for a natural look or a heavy hand for an all day in the sun poolside look.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Great blush! Size change/Price not the best,jjvb,12 Jul 2024,Absolutely love this blush!! I have all the colors except one! I‚Äôm very sensitive and they don‚Äôt break me out and the pigmentation is great. I will say I removed a star because of the price. I had two of the original sized ones and the new ones are more than half the size but at the same price which I find unfair ($44 CAD). The size now is perfect since a little goes a long way and I like that we can see the color of the blush on the packaging but again the price should reflect the size difference‚Ä¶,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

The hype IS REAL,AndreaMaciel,6 Jul 2024,"This if my first Haus Labs product and let me tell you, it is THAT GOOD. Makes your skin blush, blur and not fully matte, plus it lasts more than other blushes I‚Äôve used. This is worth every penny.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
A Blush/Bronzer Hybrid?! My new staple!,trobinson472,5 Jul 2024,"This is one of the best products I‚Äôve purchased in a while! It‚Äôs like a blush/bronzer hybrid. If you like a pretty warm bronzer, then it‚Äôs a great option. My skin tone is about the shade of Caracas in NARS or Caramel in Too Faced.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Bravo Gaga!! Bravo!,MelSlaughter,3 Jul 2024,NOT incentivized! So gorgeous! Does not irritate my rosacea and if the perfect pinky mauvey flush! Very pigmented!

"Not matte, but creamy, thankfully",Anniechiki,16 Jun 2024,"This is not matte as some people call it just because it is a powder formula. Even the description says natural finish. Matte is a word that turns people like myself with dry skin type away. Matte, to me, means dry, dull, hard to blend, something that clings to dry spots, but thankfully, this is not that. The formula is a beautiful hydrating powder to cream. It blends itself. If you have a dry skin type, do not be afraid of trying this. I got Watermelon Bliss for summer, and I love it on my light-medium yellow-olive-golden skin tone.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Doesn‚Äôt last,Jmh2000,15 Jun 2024,"I love the color of this blush. It doesn‚Äôt last on me. I tried different ways to make it work, different premiers, setting sprays. It is pigmented. But doesn‚Äôt last.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Fire Moon shade is natural and easy to blend,dolledout,12 Jun 2024,Fire Moon shade is a very natural blush that looks like a hint of color on my complexion (light skin African American). I was looking for something subtle and easy to apply daily. I do not have a face that does not look  good with too much obvious blush. I did not use much and it is very easy to blend. I have used the bronzer from Clinique before for a similar look but I wanted to try something that was talc free. This is good for now but if Clinique takes their bronzer talc free‚Ä¶.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

"Good pigment, clean, long lasting but pricey",TechGlamMom,6 Jun 2024,"The HAUS LABS BY LADY GAGA Color Fuse Talc-Free Blush Powder with Fermented Arnica in the shade French Rosette is a standout product for middle-aged women with combination skin. Its talc-free formulation, infused with fermented arnica, aligns perfectly with clean beauty standards, making it safe and gentle on the skin. The blush applies smoothly; for best results, use a good quality brush, tap off excess, buff on your hand, and then apply to your cheeks. The buildable color provides a beautiful, effortless glow that enhances the complexion without being too bright, making it practical for brown skin. Despite the natural oils in combination skin showing through after a few hours, the blush‚Äôs pigment remains strong and vibrant. While it doesn't fully control oil, its lasting color and clean formulation make it a valuable addition to any makeup routine.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

üíÑperfect,atlasbenito,27 May 2024,"Blurring, blendable, amazing colors, I‚Äôm getting the other two that I don‚Äôt have cause it goes amazing on top of the liquid blushes for it to last longer without it making it look cakey. And as I get darker it will pop more on my skin and definitely recommend for beginners since you build it up little by little as well.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Stunning on brown skin!,MusicalAria,27 May 2024,"This shade is stunning on brown skin! I was a bit apprehensive at first regarding how bright this color was, but it applies so beautifully.

,ch3ls33,22 May 2024,"I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm missing because the reviews on this blush are overall so good.

This is my first hais lab purchase and I‚Äôm dissapoinrwd.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Best Blush EVER,ayeitslexa,20 May 2024,I LOVE this blush so much. It doesn‚Äôt have any pore cloggers which is essential for my acne prone skin. I love the fire moon shade; perfect for those who don‚Äôt rlly like pink blush. Also blurring!!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

So much love for these new blushes!!,3173,19 May 2024,"These new blushes are possibly my favorite Haus Labs complexion product in my collection!! Pomelo Peach, French Rosette and Hibiscus Haze are SO pretty while also looking so super natural on my face!! The pigmentation is wonderful and easily blendable especially with the other Haus Labs products including the bronzer, highlighter and foundation. I waited a while to write my review because I wanted to test these blushes over a long period of time and with different techniques and usages, and they truly passed the test. These new blushes are also a smaller size, which means they are easy to pop into my travel bag, purse or even my pocket for on the go touch ups. I‚Äôve also enjoyed using these blushes as eyeshadows, I‚Äôve used French Rosette, Fire Moon and Pomelo Peach to craft the perfect natural eye look for daytime, and Hibiscus Haze, Dragon Fruit Daze and Watermelon Bliss for my brighter night time looks. These blushes are also very long-lasting, I was recently in my school theatre production and my blush stayed beautiful the whole show through, even through all of my sweat under those hot lights. Honestly these products are so versatile that I firmly believe everyone should at least consider these truly innovative blushes.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Get this blush,cjambazian,16 May 2024,Let me preface by saying I work in the operating room in a hospital. I‚Äôve had my makeup on since 4:30 am and the blush is still going strong at 7 pm. This blush is buildable and so pretty. Def will be buying more colors!!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Love this!!,sdeschamps,14 May 2024,"Brought this shade in French Rosette and it blends so well and doesn‚Äôt leave on a cakey look, I tend to start breakouts depending on which type of makeup I put on but no issues with this brand at all. It‚Äôs a must have!!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Stellar formula. Sorta small,katclark98,11 May 2024,"The packaging change really bugs me. I wish I purchased before it‚Ä¶. 
This formula is pretty stellar. I have fair skin but find this bright pink buildable. Glad I purchased. Would love to see more shades come out",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Love it,evileva27,7 May 2024,"Lovely color, I loved it. I would get a shade darker for my skin tone next time",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
50% less product... but still paying 80% price :(,peachy2256,6 May 2024,"Are we all just ignoring the fact that they slashed the size by 50% but only reduced the price by 20?!?! We are getting half the amount but still paying 80% of the price! That means it actually costs more per ounce now and the price went UP?!!!

The formula is nice and the color lovely, but it feels like a slap in the face to get something new and have it actually cost more per ounce than the original and get less!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Size!?!,EHagwood,6 May 2024,"What happened to the size!?! I bought one when they first came out and it was 3 times the size of this one? 
The color is gorgeous but not for the price. I will be returning",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
A little goes a long way.,Jtfstone,5 May 2024,Very pretty color and highly pigmented.  Only need a small amount.  Blends well with a soft brush.  Nice packaging.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
What!!!,Vallee23,4 May 2024,The blush itself is amazing.  I have several colors but what happened to the size?  You get a third of the size for more money.  Sadly returned.  Will wait for it to go on sale.  Really small,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Wanted to love it, gorgeous colors.",lillyybear,4 May 2024,"Was extremely excited to try this blush, especially after swatching fire moon in-store. But it comes on pretty patchy / not flawless if you wear a dewy look. I‚Äôm all for the talc-free powder - but wish this applied more smoothley. Not sure if I would pick this up again..",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Omg! All my black girls get this!,Norijay,3 May 2024,10/10! To the black girl who said to get this I love you! This color is the perfect subtle blush I didn‚Äôt know I needed. As a darker skin black girl I‚Äôm truly impressed by the pigment but this! Haus labs really won with this!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Cute packaging,liiiiiiiipssss,3 May 2024,"Great packaging! Very smooth, finely milled formula that‚Äôs nicely pigmented.  This color reminds me so much of she‚Äôs so LA on my skin, just not as shimmery. In my opinion there are better blushes out there.

I gave it a 3 because it‚Äôs expensive for the size, and it does not last long on my skin. I prefer Pat mc grath, Patrick Ta, Laura mercier, and hourglass blush formulas. I‚Äôm happy to have this formula but I don‚Äôt think I will be purchasing any other colors.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Beautiful blush!!!,abster54321,2 May 2024,Colour payout is amazing you don‚Äôt need much. I wasn‚Äôt sure at first but I‚Äôm so glad I tried. Colour lasts a whole day at work and no reapplication needed. Very beautiful colour for everyday.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Absolutely Lovely,LMSinMS,1 May 2024,The most flattering shade I've used in a long time.  It also glides on the skin and seems to blur my pores.  I'm a 58 year old fair-skinned redhead and this is definitely a new favorite.  Sorry I didn't try it sooner.  Only 4 stars due to cost.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
The best blush and color,ZibasMom,29 Apr 2024,"I‚Äôm in love with this blush and the color.  The color payoff is amazing, just a little goes a very long way.  It‚Äôs beautiful on.  I can‚Äôt say enough about how beautiful it is.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
The best blush ever,Tania0520,28 Apr 2024,"I would highly recommend the Haus Labs blush to anyone looking for a high-quality and long-lasting blush. I recently tried the Haus Labs by Lady Gaga blush and I was very impressed with the quality of the product. The blush had a smooth and creamy texture that applied easily and blended seamlessly into my skin. The color payoff was great and lasted throughout the day without fading. I also appreciated the compact and sleek packaging, making it easy to carry in my makeup bag.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Pretty but you have to work for it,sjcinca,27 Apr 2024,"Some products take effort to look great, and this is definitely one of them. The colors in this line are very unique and beautiful, and I was drawn to the talc-free formula. That's about where the pros end.

I have so many other blushes that practically blend themselves, but this formula gives me anxiety when I use it on my finished base - one wrong move and the look is off. I've tried countless ways, fluffy brushes, dense brushes, dry sponges, but it's very difficult to apply. It's so strange to explain, it's very pigmented, but if you use a sparing amount there's very little payoff. Then you try again with more product and suddenly it's deposited extremely dark. It's almost as if the formula itself acts like a primer, and if you layer it's really hard to get the desired opacity. Usually, I can add buff in setting powder to diffuse it, but this formula isn't having any of that! 

I'm keeping it, but only for those days I feel daring enough to take the risk using it!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Solid blush, cute packaging",ddmarsha,27 Apr 2024,"Not wow‚Äôd by the blush, not disappointed. It‚Äôs just a blush. Price comparison of amount of product received vs price as related to the bronzer and this is expensive for Haus Labs. Not mad at it, just would not purchase another.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Magical, unmatched formula",myola,27 Apr 2024,"I have Pomelo and Dragon Daze in the original packaging and I recently got French Rosette and Fire Moon during the sale. these blushes are EXCELLENT. They have a blurring, buttery, smooth feel to them, unlike any other blush I have. I am a blush lover and this is hands down the best quality for $$. I also say that even with the new smaller packaging. I actually prefer the smaller size. They feel exactly the right size for such a pigmented blush formula. This blush made me such a fan of this brand!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,TayH9,26 Apr 2024,I love these blushes. They‚Äôre long lasting and the shades are so beautiful. One of my most reached for blush products for sure!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"a must have, silky & perfect",turtlegonfab,26 Apr 2024,"I knew I would like this blush, but I didn't think it would be thE best powder blush I've ever used in my life. & I've been on the planet longer than I care to admit. it's SO smooth, so easy to apply, blends out so perfectly, so versatile & lasts allll day. some days I only apply spf, this blush, mascara, lip balm & I am good. I've even applied this directly to bare skin & it looks fab. I definitely need more colors. bravo gaga, I knew I could trust u.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
BEST BLUSH!,coconutnani,26 Apr 2024,I love these blushes! I honestly love all of haus labs products and the blushes are my favorite and i‚Äôm definitely going to get more colors. It is very pigmented but it‚Äôs not overwhelmingly pigmented.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Great blush!,sig94,26 Apr 2024,"Great blush, long lasting with excellent colour payoff. Warning‚Äîvery pigmented, so use a small amount at a time and blend lightly. I think it will last a long time.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Soo small!,JacquelinM,25 Apr 2024,"For the price and size?? No thanks, color is cute but there‚Äôs so many other affordable options.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

love it,nessa565,24 Apr 2024,this is so pigmented and applies so smooth. I tested it even without makeup and it went in smooth. I can apply with or without powder over my base (which is the ilia skin tint). it's so pretty. I picked up the fire moon and the peach and love both.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,jennifercasti,24 Apr 2024,I purchased fire moon during the Sephora sale and it‚Äôs even prettier in person!! Applied it to workout and stayed on. Only complaint is there‚Äôs fallout but otherwise it‚Äôs a great blush!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Cool-toned bliss,23Lexy23,24 Apr 2024,"I'm really loving this product! It's not a subtle blush, so I've learned to apply it very lightly, but I find myself reaching for it all the time. After getting tired of blushes turning orangey on me, I decided to give this cool-toned pink a try, and I'm glad I did. The flush it gives looks incredibly natural, and it doesn't leave any powdery feeling on my skin. Plus, I adore the packaging!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Super pigmented blush,ashernicole,24 Apr 2024,"I really love these blushes! I got the shade French rosette and it‚Äôs such a natural looking blush in a neutral pink color. It was fairly small which I know is a change from their previous packaging, and I feel the size difference could have been reflected more in the price, since it is still fairly expensive. That being said, I really love this blush and it is extremely pigmented so a little goes a very long way so it will still last a long time.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Medium-deep-tan complexion girlies. Luxe packaging,LoreLaMe,23 Apr 2024,"She‚Äôs so pretty & shows up! Definitely one of the most unique peach/brown blushes on the market. It‚Äôs sheer imo, so fairer complexions should try this one too. I do love the size‚Ä¶having too much product is wasteful too",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Believe the hype; luxe packaging & formula.,LoreLaMe,23 Apr 2024,"Personally I wasn‚Äôt interested in HL older packaging, so I do love the size. I am medium-deep complexion (neutral) & it‚Äôs so pretty! Wonderful composition (which built with opacity to build-up the pigment) & to boot; hardly any fallout.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Lives up to the hype,spamala,23 Apr 2024,"I got this online during the Sephora sale and wasn‚Äôt actually expecting it to be anything special but wow, it‚Äôs so good! I usually reapply blush often throughout the day but this lasts forever and stays really pigmented for hours. Beautiful finish and packaging. I just have zero bad to say.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,sbjlouky,22 Apr 2024,I‚Äôve been in the market for a blush that would show up as peach on brown skin. I guess I‚Äôm still in the market as this one looks kinda pink on me ü•∫ aside from color the formula is quite nice.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Only Powder Blush I‚Äôll Use,makeupbabe28,22 Apr 2024,The most beautiful powder blush formula! It is pigmented but can be diffused into a sheer wash of color (my preferred blush look) that stays all day! It has a natural finish that looks gorgeous on my skin. French Rosette is my favorite color for my fair skin,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
My dream summer blush,juhailey,20 Apr 2024,"I love this formula and how long lasting this blush is. The color range is beautiful, but I went for a color that I didn't have in my collection (Dragon fruit daze). I'm hoping to pick some more different shades soon!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Mediocre,lovemakeupy,20 Apr 2024,I don‚Äôt know if mine was just a bad batch because everyone keeps saying they are pigmented and I don‚Äôt see any pigment anywhere. I wish I would‚Äôve returned this.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,Nels001,19 Apr 2024,This blush is nice! But the size is a big no for me! I will be returning this for sure!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

A welcome addition to my kit!,PXFFYYY,19 Apr 2024,"I received the new blush launch as a gift from Haus Labs. For years I‚Äôve used LaFemme blushes  exclusively in my pro kit, but these have been a welcome addition! Super smooth, finely milled and really pigmented. I would definitely purchase these for personal and professional use. Really loving the arnica to reduce redness on my rosacea clients. The shade I‚Äôm wearing is French Rosette!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Beautiful shade!,TaviaRay,18 Apr 2024,"Such a great quality product, very pigmented! I would describe this as a bronzy shade, perfect for us brown girlies who want a shade to tie in the concealer and bronzer/contour shade. Love it!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
I LOVE IT,deneaT,17 Apr 2024,This is my first Haus Labs purchase. I LOVE IT! French Rosette is a beautiful color. It's buildable and it's not drying. I will most definitely pick up another shade,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
What the heck is this tiny blush???,dmitch00,16 Apr 2024,I have purchased a blush before and wanted a second color but this is less than half the size of the original one.  The color looks nice but I can not get over the disappointment in the size.  It seriously looks like a mini. Why????,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Best powder blush!,angcha,15 Apr 2024,"This blush is amazing! It‚Äôs so pigmented and smooth and easy to apply. I love setting my cream blush with it. I loved the formula so much I bought in 3 colors. Hibiscus haze, French rosette and watermelon bliss are all lovely.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Love this formula and color!,SophieMartinez,14 Apr 2024,"I grabbed this blush to try out from the Sephora sale, and I was NOT disappointed. The formula and finish of this blush are to die for and so gorgeous. The compact it comes in is adorable and I love that the exterior matches the blush color. While I do love this blush, I will be having to return it sadly. I had also purchased the Patrick Ta blush in She's That Girl and while the powders are slightly different, if you layer the cream and powder from the Patrick Ta blush, they are practically identical, and I can't in good consense keep the same blush with how expensive they are.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
shrinkflation sucks,vanessaro97,14 Apr 2024,Shrinkflation sucks  why would I get half of the same product for 6 dollars off,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Great texture and longevity!,ptsau,14 Apr 2024,"Great texture, color, and longevity! Also love the package. This is the only I would get at this moment  because others are either too pop or too dark. Wish they would come out with something softer and more natural colors.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
good formula. less product,kittykat1994,14 Apr 2024,I bought this blush in another color about 6months ago. Loved it. Rebought in another color. It was half the size. Much less value for the price.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Disappointing,natlap21,14 Apr 2024,I love these blushes but moving from 11g to 5g for basically the same price is disgusting.  Returning.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
TINY not worth the price tag,natbeauty28,14 Apr 2024,55% less product for $34? this is closer to a mini blush than the original 11g blush. disappointing,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Say NO to Shrinkflation!,misslola,14 Apr 2024,"Reformulating just to give a smaller size? That‚Äôs a page straight out of the Milk makeup handbook. I don‚Äôt support brands that do this, especially when there are better blushes on the market.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,anniecubslife,13 Apr 2024,This is the most beautiful shade. I have light/med to med skin when I self-tan and it's a wash of beachy sun kissed color. I was afraid it was going to be too dark but it's buildable and actually a versatile shade.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Smaller pans now!!,elissa93,13 Apr 2024,I have been using haus labs for a hot minute now and have two other blushes of theirs (love the blushes!) purchased a new color (French rosette) love the color but was very shocked to see that the pans are now under half the size that they were.

So Pigmenged‚Ä¶ So Beautiful,beautybyumme,9 Apr 2024,"I have both Pomelo Peach and Lavender Blonde (part of the old packaging). Both shades are beautiful. I have a medium skin tone with neutral undertones. These are so pigmented and one of my favorite powder blushes at the moment. They blend beautifully on the skin and last all day. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this product. I will be purchasing more shades in the future. 

Also love this new packaging!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
A pass for me,MariannaV,7 Apr 2024,"I wanted a bright blush. The Dragon Fruit Daze blush is bright but oddly enough not that pigmented. I needed several layers to achieve any significant color. Apart from the weak color the other downside is how dry and powdery it is. So I am not a fan.

The Armani Luminous  Silk Glow Blush #52 is so much softer silkier and finely milled that there is no contest. It also has a more elegant and sophisticated color.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Hard pass,WoWiTzCoRiE,7 Apr 2024,Wayyyy too pigmented. Ruined one of my favorite Sonia G brushes. It has a tendency to be patchy and for the cost per ounce it just is not worth it. Returned it. The Hibiscus Haze was just as bad.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Just get it‚Ä¶,aintnowifey,7 Apr 2024,"I need this in every color. I‚Äôve never had a blush apply so beautifully, be so pigmented, and look natural depending on how I want it.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Beautiful colors,IslaCarys,6 Apr 2024,"The hardest choice is which shade to pick. I wanted most of them. French Rosette seemed like the one I could use the most as a warm rose, but Fire Moon sure comes in close because it's tawny. These are so smooth and pigmented. The only blushes to rival them as far as lasting power are from NARS.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,Kimbertimber1,5 Apr 2024,Love Haus Lab anything this brand is one of my top 3 picks and this blush is absolutely stunning on.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

The Best Blush!,karinep13,4 Apr 2024,"I just tried this blush and am so impressed with the pigment + how smoothly it goes on. A little goes a long way so this blush will last a long time and the pomelo peach shade looks so good on my olive skin. When I was finished with my makeup, it looked like it was airbrushed onto my cheeks. Would highly recommend this blush to anyone!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Love love!,annap0106,4 Apr 2024,I bought this myself and I love it! It‚Äôs quite pigmented but I like that for my skin tone! The product itself is soft and matte and lasts all day!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

,filthyglam,2 Apr 2024,"I missed these blushes! I was gifted the reintroduced line in exchange for an honest review and I can definitely say I've already incorporated them into my everyday routine. The color ranges are absolutely gorgeous, my faves have to be French Rosette and Hibiscus Haze. They are so soft and the application with the new brush is so easy and precise for both packing on color where I want and diffusing it out.

I usually reach for cream or liquid blushes nowadays because most powders aren‚Äôt pigmented enough on my dark skin. This blush however, was  so pigmented and so beautiful.

Gorgeous re-release from Haus Labs!,drewecholsmua,25 Mar 2024,"I absolutely love the Color Fuse Blush re-release from Haus Labs! Pomelo Peach provides the perfect amount of warmth to my skin without running too orange. It's insanely pigmented with minimal fading throughout the day and applies beautifully over the Blush Matte Hy-Power Pigment Paint! I loved the original launch of these but agreed that the pans were too large for a single blush compact, so I‚Äôm glad they decided to make them smaller and lower the price. I also love that they added a new brush to the line to use with them!

It can be worn as a sheer wash or as a full-on pop of color. It also pairs so beautifully with the shade French Rosette when I want to play up the dimension of my face with blush.

These blushes and brush were graciously sent by Haus Labs for review!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
New Favorite Blush!,landmbfan,25 Mar 2024,"I use the hibiscus shade. This blush is amazing. It looks like your skin, not chalky or dry. I just found a new favorite blush! Don‚Äôt let the size fool you; a little goes a long way. I highly recommend.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

ICONIC,Yardene,24 Mar 2024,When haus labs originally released their blush I instantly fell in love. I was lucky enough to be gifted its relaunch by haus labs. Its high payoff and beautiful formula which made the original Iconic are still present. But it‚Äôs more compact size and sleeker packaging make it even better for traveling and daily use! If you are looking for a blush that can do both natural and high glamor you found your match.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
HAUS LABS DOES IT AGAIN,aremi13,24 Mar 2024,"I‚Äôve already tried Haus Labs‚Äô rose quartz highlighter as a blush, so I picked this one up for summer. The color is so beautiful, it makes me look like I just spent a day in the sun! My skin is very oily/acne prone, but this blush stayed on my skin the whole day. It‚Äôs also very pigmented.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
My New Favorite Blush!!,lnponder,24 Mar 2024,"I was gifted this product by Haus Labs in exchange for my honest review! 

When I saw this blush shade, I KNEW I would love it...I have been on THEE HUNT!!! for a cool-pink blush and one that was revolutionary. Dragon Fruit Daze, please claim your throne as the blush queen of my heart. I know it sounds silly but I love applying it and I look forward to applying it everyday I do my makeup! Not just because the color is gorgeous but the formula is so neat! 

Truthfully, as much as I loved the color it is VERY pigmented when first applied but I found the way that works for me is dabbing a little on the apple of my cheek with one side of the Haus Labs dual sided brush (also gifted) and then blending it out from there with the other slanted side. I personally love a blush that is super pigmented because I'm getting a value in my opinion. In the case of Haus Labs, it's pigmented so a little goes a long way, it's blurring, and for a powdered blush it adheres to the skin very naturally compared to other powdered blushes on the market. 

I think every blush shade is gorgeous and my honorable mentions are French Rosette and Hibiscus Haze, ladies-in-waiting to my personal queen, Dragon Fruit Daze. I love mauves but I've never had a cool pink blush in my makeup bag before and Haus Labs nailed it perfectly in my opinion!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Less than half of product since relaunch,ClutchWV,23 Mar 2024,"I have to say I love the formula and colors of this blush. I purchased 3 colors of the old style packaging. The best thing is that it stays on my dry skin all day, which normally blush fades away on me. So I was happy to spend more money when I saw new shades were released. I just purchased French Rosette and it is literally less than half of the old style packaging. The old is .039, the new is .018 oz!!! Not even half for the same price!! I was going to purchase the other new shade, but I feel like us consumers are being duped. I would have given 5 stars if I didn't feel conned. Shame on Haus Labs.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Packaging Upgrade FOR THE WIN,s15bbrau,23 Mar 2024,"I was gifted these blush powders from Haus Labs for my honest feedback and review. I already purchased blush from them in the past, It was more expensive, you did get a lot of product in the pan, But I have barely made a dent in that one. The relaunch with new packaging, really made me happy to try again! The formula is fabulous, I really like combining Pomelo Peach with French Rosette. You can make them soft, or really build and amplify for more drama. Perfect for traveling!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
A Stunning One-Swipe Skincare Infusion,tatenjanes,23 Mar 2024,"The Haus Labs color fuse blushes were gifted to me by the brand for an honest review. I have always loved this blush formula, even before the repackaged version was released. However, i‚Äôm not sure how to feel about the size to pricing ratio with the new packaging. The old size would‚Äôve lasted a lifetime, but the new blushes will last half a lifetime, but for only a $6 price difference. It‚Äôs still the same great mega-pigmented and easily bendable formula as before. The two new shades, particularly ‚ÄúFrench Rosette,‚Äù are a great addition to the range of colors offered by the brand, however I was disappointed that they did not bring back the shade ‚ÄúA√ßa√≠ Sky‚Äù from the original release. I love how bendable this powder formula is, as it allows me to mix colors and even create the ombr√© blush effect, that has been coming into style. I find that ‚ÄúFrench Rosette‚Äù and ‚ÄúPomelo Peach‚Äù match quite well for the ombr√© look. Overall, the price and size change hasn‚Äôt changed my main opinion on this blush: it is a perfect formula that is GOOD for my skin, feels hydrating and soft, and packs a pigment punch that gives the product long life. Even with the smaller sizes, you‚Äôll have blush for months and I appreciate that with beauty products.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Great Blush Product,annikaganguly,22 Mar 2024,I love the pigment in this product! The pop of pink is so pretty and vibrant. Product is high quality and sits well with other makeup!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Loved but small,Milyn09,22 Mar 2024,This color fire moon is very pretty but I can‚Äôt get over how small it is. I purchased but had a 10 dollar gift card otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have. Then again inflation is crazy so no surprise they made it smaller and only 6 bucks cheaper,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
cutest blush,MRothhaas,22 Mar 2024,to start - the packaging is awesome. Feels super high quality and I love that even though there isn't that cheap plastic glass on the front like a lot of brands do - they put the exact color on it so you know exactly what your grabbing without having to check. The product is so pretty and the pigment is amazing - you do not need much for a big impact. Absolutely adore this product and am so excited to test out the other colors.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

I've always been a fan of the Color Fuse Blush so I was super excited when they brought it back. The new shades are great too, and was surprised that I ended up liking every single one. I love the new packaging, however they're a lot smaller than they used to be. These blushes are so pigmented that a little goes a long long way so it's not really an issue, but I think i'd be able easier to apply with a  brush if it had a larger pan.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Thank godga they‚Äôre back! And cuter than ever!!,AphroditeLadyy,16 Mar 2024,I have loved this blush so much and am so glad that they are back for GOOD! My favorite shade is the cool toned dragon fruit daze. Such a good dupe for high end comparisons that are a similar shade. This blush blends so seamlessly and all you need is the smallest amount. Super pigmented!! I love the formula and find it lasts long!! Melts into the skin and works so well with my other makeup. I LOVE the new packaging. The old blush was 11g for $38 to now 5g for $32. I am happy they are smaller though and slightly cheaper because a little bit truly goes a long way this is going to last you forever. Thank you Haus Labs for sending them for my honest review!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

I haven't worn blush in a few years because the color always feels too dramatic on my skin, but I found French Rosette to be the perfect pop of color to really brighten up my look.

The size of the product is on the smaller side but if you don't wear blush daily like myself then you'll get good use of the amount. Really happy with this product and excited to start wearing blush again! Thank you Haus Labs for gifting me this product for my honest review.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

New formulation = half the size,brittanyleblanc,15 Mar 2024,"Have 3 of the originals, just purchased French Rosette with the relaunch. NEW BLUSHES ARE HALF THE SIZE OF ORIGINAL BLUSHES WITH ALL SILVER PACKAGING! I assumed the new blushes would be the same size but literally gasped when I opened the new one. Formula is great but buyer beware!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
A shade for everyone!,Tigressdana,15 Mar 2024,"Lavender Blonde and Dragon Fruit Daze are already in my makeup bag and I love them! I was so excited to be gifted all 6 blushes with the new updated packaging including the two new colors by Haus Labs! The new packaging is about half the size of the original packaging but they did lower the price for them. They are the perfect size to throw in your purse to go from your day to evening look quickly!
Fire Moon isn‚Äôt a color I would normally buy but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. I feel like it could be used as a bronzer and/or as a blonzer (blush and bronzer). French Rosette is actually a new favorite of mine! French Rosette and Hibiscus Haze are my new go to colors!
As everyone else says they are very pigmented and a little goes a long way. The new brush is perfect for applying them and then blending out as well. I also love how you don‚Äôt have tons of fall out from the product. I always hate when that happens, I feel like I‚Äôm not only making a mess but wasting product! This had very little fallout! There is a shade for everyone with these 6!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
In love with this blush!!,hausofvictoria,15 Mar 2024,Wow Haus Labs!! They really did their thing with this blush! Super pigmented & beautiful shades that blends beautifully! I will buy this product over and over again! My 2 favorite shades are hibiscus haze & pomelo peach,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
I need to file a complaint Ms. Gaga,brookecl22,15 Mar 2024,"I LOVE this blush, but what the heck happened to the size?! This redesign looks like a mini, which would be nice if we still had a bigger full size like the original! Disappointing to say the least.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
back and better than ever,nicolemonster,15 Mar 2024,"I was DEVASTATED when Haus Labs stopped selling their color fuse blushes because I thought they were INCREDIBLE (l've been a die hard pomelo peach fan since their original launch) so when they announced they were relaunching these blushes I was ecstatic! Then I was lucky enough to receive all 6 shades from Haus Labs in exchange for my honest review! The new packaging is soo cute it's probably my favorite packaging on any of their products thus far. The smaller size is great for bringing blush on the go. All this and two new BEAUTIFUL shades??? Can't be beat! I have fair skin (Haus Labs foundation shade 70) and was able to use fire moon like a bronzer and French rosette as blush and I LOVE the way it looks (pictured here)!! Haus Labs, you never miss!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Long lasting, high pigment!",SJM1996,15 Mar 2024,"Haus Labs gifted me all of the shades of the Color Fuse Blushes. While I usually opt for a colour like Hibiscus Haze (and I do love that colour), shockingly my favourite is Watermelon Bliss. I was a bit intimidated by the color at first, but it is so beautiful on (see photo) and not overpowering. 

These blushes are definitely very buildable, while I use a very small amount for a more natural look, if you prefer more or a lot of colour, these will work great for you. 

A little goes a LONG way with these blushes as they have amazing pigment. They are also very long lasting and still look great after a days wear. Due to the high pigment and staying power, this blush will last me a very long time even with daily use. Would definitely recommend!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
I‚Äôm Blushing,hunterkelley,15 Mar 2024,"Haus Labs gifted me this to try and I‚Äôm so happy they did because I feel like I always use too much or not enough with powder blushes but this one was easy to use. This blush is so smooth and easy to use, and is super buildable! It‚Äôs smooth and silky, and packaging for me makes or breaks a product and this compact is so cute and nice.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Powerhouse blushes!!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,cosmislover,15 Mar 2024,"Haus Labs gifted me all shades - thank you!

At first glance, dragon fruit daze was mine and all my co-workers favorite shade (Sephora workers) but after trying all of them, I am OBSESSED with using fire moon to bronze and french rosette to blush. So creamy and pigmented!! I feel like so many brands are transitioning to liquids and cream blushes which is great but there's still a large portion of clientele that will always prefer and be more comfortable using powder blushes, yet now there's a misconception that they're drying and the opposite of hydrating. This is NOT true when it comes to the Haus Labs blushes! Honestly all powders from this brand are perfect for all skin types because everyone can use more hydration and this is why I will always prefer their powders over other brands!

I was actually playing around with eyeliner and decided the look came out too one dimensional so I decided to add every single blush to my look to add that dimension and uniqueness. The attached picture was how it turned out. I'm so happy with these products and all the creativity they've lended me while also being quality products!!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Perfect application!,johnrbarajas,15 Mar 2024,Thank you to Haus Labs gifting me all 6 shades of the Color Fuse Blush Powder and the Dual-Ended Multi-purpose brush. Highly recommend the Pomelo Peach blush. Gives that soft subtle look that‚Äôs perfect for an occasion! Easy to apply and long lasting.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
The most pigmented blushes you will find!!,HeatherHarpole,14 Mar 2024,"Haus Labs gifted me 6 shades of the Color Fuse Blush Powder and the Dual-Ended Multi-purpose brush. My favorite shades I tried are the Hibiscus Haze, French Rosette, and Pomelo Peach. Each of these shades are incredibly pigmented and added amazing color to my face! Especially after winter these are the perfect tones to compliment my pale skin currently. I definitely will be giving these blushes out to my friends and family since they are now my favorite blushes I‚Äôve ever tried!

Hello pigment!,hooliganx,14 Mar 2024,These blushes were love at first swipe! I was gifted these blushes by haus labs and fell in love with each one that has gone on my cheeks. These blushes are highly pigmented and blend like a dream. I personally love the fact that the packaging is more compact compared to the other ones so they don‚Äôt take up as much space in my vanity and are easier to travel with. An added bonus is all the great skincare properties that are a part of this blush. Definitely excited to have these in my collection and i suggest everyone else tries these as well!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
So much pigment!,emilee1385,14 Mar 2024,"I just love how so little goes such a long way! And it js so smooth to the touch and blends amazingly! I am using the new color Fire moon and it is a nice nude blush! It is smaller than the original but I still think it will last awhile with how little you need to use!

I received this from Haus Labs to review.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Hydrating powder blush?! Only Haus Labs,missbiancap,14 Mar 2024,"Haus Labs kindly gifted me all six shades of the Color Fuse Blush Powder as well as the Dual-Ended Multi-Purpose Brush in exchange for an honest review.  As per usual, I‚Äôm in love. I‚Äôm a blush snob and have fallen into a routine of mostly cream and liquid blush products (as many of us have in recent years), so I was unsure of going back to a powder. Something magic is clearly infused into these blush compacts, because the formula is truly a hydrating powder. No kickback, no dryness. If you want a radiant, dewy complexion but love a powder product, this is THE ONE. In my photos, I‚Äôm wearing the shade French Rosette, and no, I am NOT wearing highlighter. My skin just looks healthy, perhaps it‚Äôs the squalane. And I also appreciate that it‚Äôs talc-free. 

Though I applied it with the Dual-Ended Multi-Purpose brush, a pigmented blush newb may want to use a fluffier brush and a light hand. (I‚Äôll happily use the brush for creams.) There‚Äôs lots of pigment, but never patchy. Stefani Joanne and her team just always deliver quality!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
I fell in love with this!,FaithVanryswyk,14 Mar 2024,"fell in love with this powder as soon as I put it on!! The color lasted all day for me - literally from 8 am until I got home at 7 it was still there!! The colors are great and pigmented you don‚Äôt need much to get some color, the brush worked amazing to apply it too!!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Love,catherina8,14 Mar 2024,"Pomelo Peach is my new everyday no makeup blush. It's such a pretty coral for just a touch of color. It's the same amazing pigmented formula as the original; still super blendable and light enough for summer.

I received this from Haus Labs in exchange for my honest review.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Beautiful but pricey.,asphyxiababe,14 Mar 2024,Absolutely love the color and amazing staying power. The size difference however is ridiculous.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Too small,abbydv,14 Mar 2024,"Way too small, I have the new one and original one and the new one is not even half the size of the OG. Not worth the price at all! Super disappointed",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,kikiprit,14 Mar 2024,Received this today and I‚Äôm shocked at the size! It is less than half the size that it used to be. Not sure how the brand thought that was okay and to only decrease the price by $6. I will be returning,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
BLUSH YEAH üòä,babygrux2,14 Mar 2024,"I received the new Haus Labs Color Fuse Blushes in exchange for an honest review. I got the Color Fuse Blushes the first time around, and I can confidently say it‚Äôs the same amazing formula! Huge difference comes in the amount of product and new packaging; I personally prefer the updated packaging and getting less product for a lower cost! These blushes are EXTREMELY pigmented while remaining blendable; a little goes a long way! The new shades Fire Moon + French Rosette are a perfect edition to the extensive and universally flattering shade range! Can‚Äôt wait to display these cuties on my vanity!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Blush Perfection,leonettabeauty,14 Mar 2024,"I'm absolutely in love with the Color Fuse Blush Powder from Haus Labs! Not only does the packaging exude elegance, but the product itself blends like a dream, leaving a beautiful flush of color on my cheeks.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Great,mlaird0128,14 Mar 2024,I love this blush line. It goes on so smooth and easier to build. The shade range is great. I used these before they updated them and I still love them. The packaging it smaller which is nice. I did get gifted from haus labs.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Lady Gaga x Haus Labs never fails!!,emmanjo,13 Mar 2024,"First, thank you Haus Labs for gifting six new blush powders. This is my honest review: I am currently in the journey of finding the perfect one. The first shade I tried from this refreshed line is the French Rosette and you know what‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs exactly what i am looking for! This is my go-to-blush companion going forward.  Lady Gaga (via HL) is taking care of my complexion for sure! This is the first blush that blends well with my skin, a perfect companion with the Triclone Concealer (disclaimer: the concealer ain‚Äôt gifted; just guilty of being a daily user), and provides me with the natural glow/flush, that ain‚Äôt fake. My entire complexion looks exactly the same if not better 9 hours later after work. If you‚Äôre on a similar quest like me in searching for the best blush, this is IT!!! Beyond excited to try the other shades especially Hibiscus Haze shades‚Ä¶.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Haus Labs does it again!,missjacocks,13 Mar 2024,"I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and honestly, I am not a blush girl, but I am in LOVE with these new blushes. I‚Äôm partial to Dragonfruit Daze! I used it and it will be in rotation this spring and summer. Thank you Haus Labs!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Dragon Fruit Daze,fashionedbylies,13 Mar 2024,"COLOR FUSE BLUSH POWDERS are one of my favorite products from Haus Labs. The pigment has great payoff and layering builds a beautiful saturation that allows creative control with versatile looks. With a silky smooth finish that is light-weight on the skin, these blush powders are perfect for both everyday and special occasions. I‚Äôm wearing the shade DRAGON FRUIT DAZE, a beautiful vibrant pink.

 I was gifted this product in exchange for an honest review",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
These are decadent!,CourtneyC512,13 Mar 2024,"I was graciously gifted these Color Fuse Blush Powders by Haus Labs. I‚Äôm in love with these new color options and the new packaging. It feels so lux. These blushes are so soft on the skin, so pigmented, and very blendable. Fire Moon is such a nice, neutral color that‚Äôs wearable daily and I really love French Rosette and Pomelo Peach for pops of pretty color for any time I need a quick face refresh. For my photos, I am wearing Fire Moon and Watermelon Bliss. You‚Äôll love these, I promise. They‚Äôre gorgeous!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,23mortimer,13 Mar 2024,"This product was gifted to me by Haus Labs in exchange for an honest review. I am wearing the shade Hibiscus glaze layered on French Rosette. The new formula paired with the blush brush gives a lighter touch, yet still VERY buildable. I usually go for a more subtle blush most days, and these lighter shades made it easy to look natural but still add little bit of life and color back to my face after complexion products. Very easy to place the blush exactly where you want it on the face and it stays in place.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Upping my review from last time,Brianne5000,13 Mar 2024,"When I initially tried this blush, I gave it a 4 out of 5 because I didn't think it was very saturated. I was wrong! The color is super saturated and buildable. I have incorporated Pomelo Peach into my every day look. I was excited to try Hibiscus Haze (in the picture below) and it did not disappoint either. I also used the new dual ended brush to apply. Can't wait to experiment more with my new blush wardrobe!!

Also wearing from Haus Labs: 06 and 12 concealer, Fig lip glaze, and Peach Quartz highlighter. 

I was gifted this product in exchange for my review.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Unadvertised Travel Size!!,KiefWoman,13 Mar 2024,"Pretty shocking to receive the new size which is HALF the amount (5g) vs. the original (11g) for only $6 less. I love the original formula, but the unannounced size difference is off putting enough¬†that I don't think I'll be ordering another color any time soon, if ever. Pretty disappointed, Haus Labs.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Fav blush right now!!,,13 Mar 2024,"Firstly I want to thank Haus Labs for sending me these blushes! So now for the review, I absolutely love the formula of these blushes, they always blend out so seamlessly and it‚Äôs coverage can be built up! Which I personally prefer, the package change is a big difference but personally I think that the color matching packaging matching the blush color is helpful especially in my makeup collection! The new shades are amazing too! In the picture I‚Äôm wearing ‚ÄòFire Moon‚Äô all over and it‚Äôs so pretty!! I would highly recommend these blushes they‚Äôre so amazing, quality is always on point!‚Äô",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Must have,jiglesias35,13 Mar 2024,Like the natural finish it gives very easy to blend love the color good for a everyday look,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,birdeania,13 Mar 2024,This is one of the most beautiful powder blush formulas. I was so bummed when they were sold out. Rushed to order this and when I saw how small the packaging was I was truly disappointed. 11g to 5g for the same price. Shame!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
another banger from HL!,hausofkristen,12 Mar 2024,i was gifted these blushes in exchange for an honest review! i am very happy to say i finally found a dupe for my fav MAC blush! french rosette is like sweet enough 2.0! i know that it was downsized but the pigment is outrageous and a very little bit goes a long way and you can tell they will last a very long time! also easier to fit in my makeup kit. ü©∑,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
You Need This NOW!!!,hausofalyssa,12 Mar 2024,"I was gifted these blushes by Haus Labs

Pigmented!,Ducky09,12 Mar 2024,"OBSESSED with this blush! I've tried all shades and they're all stunning. It is pigmented, so little is needed. It is buildable though, so if heavy blush is your thing, that's easily achievable. It goes on smoothly and flawlessly over foundation. Grab each shade! You won't regret it. Thanks Haus Labs for the gift! It's my favorite yet!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Not your average blush, this is better!",veggielov3r,12 Mar 2024,"Haus Labs kindly gifted these blushes to me. For being a powder formula these blushes have an insane amount of pigment. I love how easy it is to apply lightly for a natural flush of color or build up the intensity. French rosette has the most beautiful neutral rose shade, it‚Äôs not an overwhelmingly pink color. I definitely prefer the new packaging, it‚Äôs easier to tell which shade is which.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Color Fuse blush is back!,brittie93,12 Mar 2024,"Haus Labs has re-launched its color fuse blush with brand new packaging and two NEW shades! I tried out one of the new shades, french rosette (right cheek), and an old favorite, watermelon bliss (left cheek). This is the same formula I know and love, but with the new colorful packaging I can reach for the shade I want instead of fumbling through my bag of silver compacts. The new compact is‚Ä¶well, more compact! It fits in the palm of my hand and travels more easily in my makeup bag. The Haus knows how to build a brush that complements the products nicely. Watch my video to see it in action! For transparency: Haus labs sent me these products in exchange for an honest review.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

My everyday blush!,LexCanez,12 Mar 2024,"These blushes have a great pigmentation, I think having the Haus labs blush brush helps a lot with application and making sure your don‚Äôt get blotchy results OR over barring color!

Love product but hate shrinkage of product!,CosmicSiren,12 Mar 2024,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the blushes, but I‚Äôm really disappointed the fact that the blushes shrunk in size and you‚Äôre basically paying for the same product but smaller packaging!

Best blush ever.,tracymartel,12 Mar 2024,"*product was gifted for review*
Color fuse blush has been my absolute favorite blush since its initial release. Pigmented enough to use as eyeshadow but also blends seamlessly into the skin on the face for a natural flush.

"Half the size, same cost.",cindylou22,12 Mar 2024,"I have all of the new and old blushes in each shade.

seamless blend and beautiful color,mozalt,11 Mar 2024,"This was kindly gifted to be my Haus Labs for my honest review of the product. The Haus Labs Color Fuse Blush Powder just boosted up to the top of my blush ranks, and I love to use blush. The formula feels like a soft velvet powder and applies to the skin seamlessly and smoothly. I‚Äôm a blush lover so I love when they have a punch of color and these certainly do! they‚Äôre extremely pigmented but also not scary, they‚Äôre a beautiful mixture. I was able to use it both for drag (shade: Dragon Fruit Daze and Watermelon Bliss) and out of drag (shade: Fire moon). The only downside is that it‚Äôs smaller than the original release (which I wasn‚Äôt able to buy) but i‚Äôm happy that they brought them back because the formula is so unique. They are definitely a new staple in my daily routine! just like everything else released from Haus Labs, its truly amazing.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Lots of pigment!,Jesicalyn,11 Mar 2024,Wow wow wow at the pigment of these blushes! Thank you Haus labs for gifting me this new line! I love that a little product blends a long way.

I ADORE this blush! I had the old color fuse blushes from before the re-design and I didn't think I could love them more than I already did! The new shades are gorgeous as well! Pomelo Peach and Dragon Fruit Daze are my favorites, and I love that the component is a perfect size to keep in my purse with a mirror for touch ups (not that you'll really need it because these blushes stay ON!). Highly recommend, I've used many of the colors on all of my friends and they really look beautiful on every different skin tone.

great colors!!,avaf2022,11 Mar 2024,I have received this product from haus labs in exchange for an honest review. Their new color fuse blush powder is a must have in my everyday routine. My 2 favorite colors are fire moon and hibiscus haze. Fire moon is a bit of a bronze color and highlights my medium skin complexion. The blushes feel light weight like noting is on your face but also plays the same purpose as a regular blush would. Hibiscus haze is more of a pink-ish color which gives me a lighter complexion on my face. I used the angle side of the brush for a more sculpted look on my cheeks. I would recommend this product to everyone and will continue to use it in my makeup routine!!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
VISIBLY HYDRATING,SkunkySweet,11 Mar 2024,"Multiple people complimented how bright and hydrated my skin looked while wearing Color Fuse Blush Powder.  I used the same combo of Dragon Fruit Daze and Fire Moon for two separate looks.  Once for a classy Boy Glam look, then for an outrageous Drag Queen Brunch, as Skunky Sweet.  For Boy Glam, I used Triclone Skintech foundation in shade 15.  These blushes fuse wonderfully with the Triclone Skintech foundation and enhanced a hydrated glow on my skin.  I amp up the amount of blush product I apply for drag makeup, and these formulas deliver in pigment.  The pink of Dragon Fruit Daze is what my gay dreams are made of.  The blushes can blend out to a soft natural finish, but I like people to notice I have bright blush screaming on my cheeks.  I can‚Äôt wait to create more blush focused looks with this gifted blush set from Haus Labs.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
A must have!,kaitlynhudy,11 Mar 2024,I am obsessed with this blush.  I love the way the Fire Moon  shade gives me a subtle pop of color on my chick while stick looking natural.  This shade could really function as either a blush or contour! 10/10 highly recommend.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Warning: The re-released blushes are minis!,Jfulme1,11 Mar 2024,"I ordered two of the re-released blushes and while I love this formula and the colors, I did NOT notice that these are minis (only .18 oz).

Absolutely love it!!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Great product, questionable brand ethics",Ritouche,9 Mar 2024,"Great product, awful social Media team. As a content creator, after posting a review of this product. Brand decided it would be a great idea to repost my content and removing me from the post. Not tagging me, not crediting me, not asking me. I‚Äôve purchased every product from this brand with my own money. And for them to help themselves to free content is beyond me. They steal many creators content without credit or permission and continue to ignore us when we reach out to them. While it‚Äôs a great product I will be returning, because I refuse to support a brand that takes advantage of people",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Super pigmented,JaimeCCC95,9 Mar 2024,"This so pigmented, it's great. I would be cautious if you're as fair skinned as me the darker colours are very pigmented, but I personally love it.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"The cleanest, most elegant,  perfect blush EVER.",reneelovesallbe,9 Mar 2024,"This blush... this color... the entire lineup... absolutely STUNNING!!! I chose this warmer rose color as the best choice for my fair cool skin. And this did not disappoint! I fell in love at first swipe! This highly pigmented formula is absolutely gorgeous and with the skin loving ingredients in it, it literally feels like nothing on my skin. It lasts for hours, with zero touch ups,  and the tiniest amount goes a long way, making this blush one you will have for a long time. I found one amazing thing with this blush. Yes, it's a powder, but it almost has a creamy feeling to it. Also, it gives off an inner glow. It is a natte formula, or natural, but after applied it doesn't shimmer, but it literally makes your skin glow. It's stunning, and I recommend  this to anyone who wants a truly Unique and perfect blush. This is as perfect as I have ever seen. And, there is zero fallout. It is the cleanest blush I have ever used.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Color fuse blush,LoriCStone,9 Mar 2024,"I was gifted all six shades and the blush brush in exchange for an honest review. I love these blushes , they melt into your skin beautifully.

I like how buildable they are,glamwithisa,9 Mar 2024,Haus Labs was so generous and sent me these as a gift in exchange for a review. I gravitated towards dragonfruit daze because it reminds me of this liquid blush I have that I sometimes don't blend properly. I have not had that issue with this product! It's nice and buildable and goes on super smooth. It also doesn't disturb the loose powder I use with it.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Smaller, Upgraded packaging; Same pigmented punch!",effie26,9 Mar 2024,"I was generously gifted these blushes in exchange for my honest review from Haus Labs - and wow! The two new shades are so beautiful and can fit a wide variety of skin tones. (Pictured is French Rosette) The formula is the same beautiful, buttery, blend-able formula as before ; only this time it is easier to tell your shades apart, and the size is now so much more convenient for travel. You have done it again Haus Labs!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Soft, Sultry Blushes!",digisoph,8 Mar 2024,"Sultry Soft blushes!
These are the most stunning blushes i've ever used! With so many different blushes to choose from, The Haus Labs blushes offer a soft, natural finish that can be added for more color, which gives you the option to go for a lighter or dramatic effect. The one that I think suits best for my fair skin tone would be the Dragon Fruit Daze, and Hibiscus Haze, and I also added the new Fire Moon shade to give my face some dimension. I feel like almost any shade could work for fair skin depending on the look you're going for. The new, smaller compact blushes make it easy to travel with, and still offers the same high quality ingredients such as Squalane, and Hydraberry, Vitamins C +E, so it's really good for you skin. I noticed after wearing them for awhile that they have great staying power, the color on my cheeks didn't fade off, and melted into my skin, complimenting my overall makeup nicely. I paired my blush with the Haus Labs foundation and finished it with the Haus Labs Gloss in Guava. I always feel my most beautiful self whenever I'm using Haus Labs makeup, knowing that i'm using the best. I can't wait to see what other ground breaking products Haus Labs with create next!

Pigmented and Pretty,BeckyLBC,8 Mar 2024,"WOWOWOW!
She is pigmented but she is blendable! This formula is packed full of color but is effortless to blend and diffuses with ease. Normally powdered blushes look chalky and dry on my skin.

The shade dragonfruit daze was already my favorite blush to wear so I absolutely had to try that one first and it did NOT disappoint!

I love how this powder doesn‚Äôt have shimmer in it and I love how this blush adds color, yet still looks natural! The Fermented Arnica helps improve redness in your skin over time, along with many other skin loving ingredients to help nourish and protect your skin. This blush is talc-free and pretty pigmented! I applied this blush with the Haus Labs Dual-Ended Multi-Purpose brush. A little bit goes a long way, and you could build it up if you like a lot of blush! I am so glad Haus Labs brought back these blushes & introduced 2 new shades for us to try. This blush is non-comedogenic & definitely provides a second skin finish, which is perfect for any skin type! I love how compact the packaging is. This blush is perfect to take on the go.

,10kbr,6 Mar 2024,"I was lucky enough to receive all 6 of the colors from Haus Labs to try before the launch, and so far I'm really liking them. I tend to lean more towards neutral blush colors, so I've been gravitating towards French Rosette and Hibiscus Haze the most. Both are very pretty and quite pigmented, so a little goes a long way. Blush is always the first thing to fade on me, but I wouldn't say the longevity is less than any other powder blush. I swatched all 6 of the colors on me and am excited to try the rest soon! I didn't own the blush in the previous packaging, but think that this new size is great for travel and will still last a long time.

Swatches in order from top to bottom: French Rosette, Fire Moon, Pomelo Peach, Hibiscus Haze, Dragon Fruit Daze and Watermelon Bliss",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Lots of Blending Required,1Maddy,2 Nov 2023,"I have a huge blush collection and I really don't get the hype about this product.  On my fair skin, even tapping off and using a very light hand followed by blending the edges with a large powder brush, I still think it doesn't blend as well as other blushes I own.  Reviews said the bright colour didn't translate as super bright on the skin but it did on me.  I also thought it emphasized texture more than most.  I know I won't reach for this because it is so much work to get it to look right.  Sadly, I will be returning it.  I'm giving it 3 stars because maybe it works better on someone with a darker and younger complexion.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

It would become muddy and I found it weird since I had the HAUS lab foundation underneath. I thought both products would go well. I really love the color and it complimented my skin tone, but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
An everyday blush fave!!! Love it!!!,LibbyMakeup02,10 Aug 2023,"I know peach toned blushes suit my skin more because I‚Äôm yellow undertones, but something about this pink blush I can‚Äôt stop using it. I use it pretty much every single day since I bought it. I may even have to purchase the peach one in this formula. I love this powder blush so much.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

,Ekfas,1 Aug 2023,"Love the haus labs blushes. I pare them with the saie liquid blushes, and I am obsessed with the way my blush looks after I'm done. I never used to be a girl who was obsessed with blush, but these are making me rethink that! They look and feel great on my skin. Some brands blushes break me out, but I've never had a problem with these.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Buy buy buy - need more colors,KellyAnn33,21 Jul 2023,"This blush is stunning on my fair to light / neutral to warm skin. It appears more pink versus purple on me, but amazing. Most blush looks clownish on me and this does not. Amazing formula too. I am a huge fan.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Better than I could have imagined!,Charlottie5,11 Jul 2023,"I was a little concerned about the matte finish, the price, and I have VERY sensitive skin, so I was afraid it would make me break out. But it was perfect. Side note: it‚Äôs much easier to apply with a blender than a brush.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
WORTH EVERY PENNY,ArtisanJcu,9 Jul 2023,I was hesitant to try because I read that this has a matte finish. Was I wrong! I use the saie gel a d haus labs foundation underneath this blush. The glow is just beautiful. Very pigmented only need two taps and this lasted the while day. The watermelon shade is equally beautiful. This is a pinky-peach blush that goes on as a very rich powder. It is not drying nor flat-matte at all.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

LOVE - Beautiful color - but so pigmented,anikak,8 Jul 2023,"I love this color, it is so hard to find a pink undertone red blush. It looks so natural (when used lightly). I love this blush so much but I took off one star because it is so pigmented it can be overpowering .",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Save your money,hunterfied222,7 Jul 2023,"I love gagas products but this, its okay but deceiving. 1, it's almost IDENTICAL to dragonfruit haze, just with a (iconic) different name. 2. Trust me, its barley a purple blush at all really like i'd describe it more of a pink with a purple-y hue but not lavender and certainly not purple. I'd say get it if you're only looking for a fuchsia blush but if you're like me and expected more of a purple hue, skip this one",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Wow!!!,KFalc11,6 Jul 2023,"Run, don‚Äôt walk!!!  If you love blush, this is a must have shade in your collection. So stunningly beautiful.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Blissful Blushing Boy,abrianmpbe,1 Jul 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.
This blush looks and feels so lovely to apply and wear. It's vibrant and pigmented. The shade I have, Watermelon Bliss, is as advertised and is flattering on both my and a friend's complexion. I am shade 220 in the Triclone Skin Tech Foundation, they are 530. Despite being quite pigmented, I'm not intimidated to apply this product as it blends out very easily. I find myself applying it liberally just because of how nice it feels to apply and the finish it leaves the skin with. If you've tried other Haus Labs powder complexion products post-rebrand you know the quality of this product. I'm impressed. Consider me a blush girl now. Thanks Haus Labs.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Great formula..!!,mrsdwt04,19 Jun 2023,This formula is amazing & so pigmented. However it‚Äôs not as Ôøºvibrant as it appears in the pic. It‚Äôs more of a dull shade. I no usually the shade is slightly different but I still thought it be more vibrant then it is. Luv the formula.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Too much,Lisaaaaaaaaa,20 May 2023,I wanted to love this so bad. I agree that it is very pigmented and good price point for the amount of product you get. However the watermelon bliss just had way too much color payoff. I prefer blushes that are buildable. I felt like a clown the first few times I wore this blush.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Beautiful Color but Maybe Not For Pasty Skin,ErinN14,17 May 2023,"I wanted to love the acai sky shade so much. I could not get it to work with my complexation.

Beautiful Red Shade,ErinN14,17 May 2023,This blush is beautiful online and in person! I didn't think that it would look good on me because I am so pale but it looks like a nice flush of color when applied lightly.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Pomelo Pearch,kayflorida,14 May 2023,"This color looks so orange / tangerine to me in the pan and in the online swatches, but when tested in the store on my arm, it's like the perfect shade of matte peach.  I have light/medium neutral skin tone and I really love this color on me and it doesn't look orange at all.

Pretty but Dior Pink blush Better,hotkymama,7 May 2023,"Wanted to REALLY love this. The packaging is great, the color pretty.

Worth every penny,Nichole922,26 Apr 2023,This is like rare beauty blush but in powder form. Extremely pigmented and you only need a little bit for your whole face. Best powder blush ever !,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
All colors are not made equal,makeuplove11,26 Apr 2023,"After seeing the hype around this blush I got the Hibiscus Haze. First thing you notice is that not all shades are made the same. Hibiscus Haze on touch is much harder than the pink Dragon shade which is super soft and almost creamy to touch.

Second, there was no pigment on this for me. I tried different brushes and there was no pigment picked up. On dipping many times, I managed to get some pigment but it weirdly highlights skin impetfections and gets super patchy.

Disappointing.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Beautiful,MelL415,25 Apr 2023,Beautiful color - so pigmented! I use over cream blush. A little goes a long way.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
THE BEST EVER,beautybyumme,24 Apr 2023,"My favorite part of my makeup routine is blush. I have a lot of them and this makes top 3.

,sbl410,22 Apr 2023,"I love this blush, a little goes a long way. Color is beautiful!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
A+ application,regditt1,21 Apr 2023,Soooo good. Very pigmented and it applies seamlessly. Highly recommend. I am fair medium but I got the dark blush because I always feel like i need more from a blush. Super happy with it. I could have gone with a lighter shade but I really like this one.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Good but not great,hirianna16,21 Apr 2023,I love this blush how it has a slight glow to it the only bad thing is that you put some on and it doesn‚Äôt show so you keep putting more and more until it shows and then a few minutes later it‚Äôs too much color as if adapting to the skin not sure how to describe it . Then you have to take some off and it turns patchy so just be careful . It also feels a little drying,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Better Than Dior Rosy Glow,natpz,18 Apr 2023,"I loooooveee how Dior Rosy Glow looks on me- but for so little product and so little pigment, it's hard to justify making it a regular repurchase. I'm not a Lady Gaga fan (I don‚Äôt dislike her tho!), so I feel like I can provide an unbiased opinion, but I will give credit where credit is due because she really slayed with this (and all of her other face products I've tried so far). The packaging itself is gorgeous- there's a mirror inside and the outside is also mirrored. No one adds mirrors to their powders anymore!!! I love that. The powder itself is so soft and velvety, the color is generously pigmented, and the finish is just stunning. Because it's so pigmented, I use a light hand with a powder brush and just tap it into the powder for a little more and slowly build until I've achieved the look I want. You definitely don't need a heavy hand so I know this will last forever. The Dragon Fruit Daze color is also the same shade as the Dior which is the primary reason I bought this. It's hard to find a true cool-toned pink that has a soft cutie bubblegum look without red, orange, or brown undertones and without being too light or too dark. This shade is perfect and if you want a more dramatic look, it can easily be achieved with just a little more powder.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Obsessed,LRucc,18 Apr 2023,"Wow!  It's an intimidating color but so gorgeous in person I couldn't resist.  It is absolutely stunning on the skin (I am fair-light) but a little goes a long way.  Use a light hand and build as needed.  I am obsessed, perfect for spring and summer.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Stunning formula and color,ilovemykitty,13 Apr 2023,"This blush! This shade! I absolutely love it!
I‚Äôm on the more fair side, so the watermelon bliss needs barely a tap with my brush and it does the trick.

Get it (especially if melanated),Moyoxo,12 Apr 2023,A little goes a long way and the price makes sense for how long this blush could last you. Think Rare beauty blush intense performance but make it Gaga,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
My new fave,chiqquitabanana,11 Apr 2023,This is such a pretty blush and it has a ton of product for the price. It‚Äôs also quite pigmented but not so much that you look like a clown. You can definitely build it up too. I love it.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Patchy and no staying power,leahmarieandy,7 Apr 2023,"I was so excited to try this product, mainly because of the great reviews, but it‚Äôs been a month and I am less than thrilled with it. The color is beautiful but no matter how I apply the product it ends up patchy! I‚Äôve tried with my fingers, beauty blender, and various blushes and it always turns out awful. I even purchased a new blush brush thinking it might help, but no such luck. No matter how I prep my skin, it just doesn‚Äôt sit well on it. Maybe it‚Äôs because I wear sunscreen but that‚Äôs a non-negotiable for me because I have been diagnosed with skin cancer so I can‚Äôt skip it. The staying power is virtually nonexistent as well, and I can count on the product being completely gone from my face after a day at work, even with setting powder.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Stunning,laboheme84,7 Apr 2023,"This is a truly beautiful product. I‚Äôd originally tried the coveted Dior rosy glow in the coral shade, but felt like it looked a little chalky if I built it up (and I am pretty fair- Nars Gobi, for reference). This just melts into the skin 
effortlessly and looks so healthy! So impressed with the texture and quality of this powder that I can‚Äôt wait to try the bronzer and highlight from this line!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Beautiful!,mamabatts,6 Apr 2023,"Amazing pigment but blends so easily, doesn‚Äôt look dry. Want more shades!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
You won‚Äôt regret it,liseyz,5 Apr 2023,"This color is gorgeous and so pigmented. Don‚Äôt be scared that it will be too bright on fair skin. A little goes a long way, so apply a very small amount of product and then build as desired. So bendable and glowy. Obsessed.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
THIS CONVERTED ME INTO A BLUSH LOVER,neduh,4 Apr 2023,"I dont like blush at all but I LOVE THIS BLUSH. gives me such a healthy glow!??? I know its a powder but it doesnt go on matte, it just feels radiant on the skin. If you are looking for a good blush, this lives up to the hype. I want more shades so bad!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Best Blush,YourSocialKat,4 Apr 2023,I was a little skeptical about the Color however I love it.  I get a lot of compliments.  Feels good on the face and blends well.  I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this blush.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Want more colors,erica0000,31 Mar 2023,"Love the color, love the formula, love everything about this blush and will try more. I saw some video reviews that said this blush was patchy but I don't get any patchiness at all.  It goes on smooth and lasts all day.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

STUNNER!!!,kbrenn981,29 Mar 2023,Wow!!! This is stunning! Blends beautifully and the color payoff is so GOOOOD! I never write reviews but couldn‚Äôt help myself from sharing the love for this blush. It lasted a full 12 hours on me and probably could have gone longer.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Love this blush!,Sharelyn,28 Mar 2023,I‚Äôm so happy with this blush!  I wouldn‚Äôt put it on freshly moisturized skin but it is perfect for a little later when my cream blush starts to fade.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Believe the hype!,Serenabobeana,28 Mar 2023,"This blush is insanely good.  I held out on buying it for quite a while but after seeing numerous positive reviews on the product, I decided to go for it.  Took a big risk buying the bright red color - upon first application, it might make you panic a little as it is so bright and feels like you put too much.... but then after blending it, it's incredible how easy it diffuses. A little goes a long way, so this compact is sure to last a long time which makes it work the price.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
amazingg,livyolivy,26 Mar 2023,"this is the best blush for me personally, it leaves a gorgeous finish and stays all day. looks very skin-like and would definitely buy in more shades!! also love lady gaga <3",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Dragonfruit daze for the win,cloudsillusions,26 Mar 2023,"I kept saying Idontneedit Idontneedit because I have She's a Doll from Patrick Ta, a very similar punchy pink color.  I wanted to use that one up first.
But after swatching in store, the texture was just so soft and blendable.  I bought it and like it more than the powder formula in the Patrick Ta because it's more buildable and easier to blend.  I think the color range would work well for most skin tones, which I love.  Highly recommend, and when I'm in the market for more blush would like to try other colors.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,Shellak9281,25 Mar 2023,I love this color highly pigmented also looks good with a quick swipe of the white shimmer over it,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
The pigment is real,lozep,25 Mar 2023,"Was really excited to try these as I already enjoy the haus lab highlighters. I swatched these in store and decided to go with dragonfruit, very similar to the dior backstage blush but more pigment and longer lasting IMO. I want to try watermelon and acai next.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Lovely formula,ale76,22 Mar 2023,"It was loved at first sight (should I say at first swatch) with this product, the color payoff is incredible.

Perfection,shales527,21 Mar 2023,One of my new fave blushes. The color is just magical. And the formula is in between matte and dewy. It's a perfect formula in my opinion. For any kind of skin. I have a huge collection especially blush but I may just pick up another shade üòâ,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Love the formula!,S0vann,21 Mar 2023,"I was honestly really happy with this blush. The color is stunning and not only that but the payoff is so seamless. Even though the formula is powder, it melts into your skin almost like it was a cream! I love it !!!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Perfection in a blush! It‚Äôs the best.,taylorannevans,21 Mar 2023,"I have very pale skin with cool pink undertones, I struggle to find products that work for me without them going orange or having yellow undertones to them. This blush is the BEST blush I have ever tried. It‚Äôs extremely pigmented, so I use a very small amount with a light hand. It‚Äôs so beautiful and perfect. I love how natural it looks. This is a forever product for me! Lady Gaga has outdone herself as she does with everything.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Luxurious formula,LittleLady12,21 Mar 2023,I have mature skin and this formula is not drying at all. It feels luxurious on the skin. Being medium to dark skin the highly pigmented color are gorgeous omeme,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Try it and be pleasantly surprised,KatKat87,21 Mar 2023,"I love how pigmented this blush is. It actually translates onto the skin as being just a natural flush of color despite the bright pink hue presented in the pan. The best part is that you can build it up if need be. All you need to do is touch your brush gently to the pan and apply and keep doing that to build it up to the desired intensity. I say it is well worth the $50 price tag because this will last me a long time because i have natural rosacea on the apples of my cheeks and running down my jawline and when i wear minimal makeup on my cheeks this is just the perfect color to run along my cheekbones! This is my first Haus Labs product and in my opinion, Gaga hit it out of the park with this blush I am officially obsessed and will be trying her other face products for sure!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Gonna need more,serigo,19 Mar 2023,"I love this shade it my favorite blush now, it stays on my combination skin soo good even when it super hot. A little bit goes a very long way and it lasts all day. Gonna be needing to get more shades now.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Great product just not for me,GooliaV,18 Mar 2023,Really good lasts all day but i find its wayyyyyyyyy to pigmented for me It took me a while to fully blend it in. Had to go over it translucent powder to make it more subtle.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Amazing color payoff and long wear,AnnaMilhouse,13 Mar 2023,I love these blushes!!! I received this blush from Haus of Gaga so I could give them feedback about the product. The day after I received the product I immediately used it on one of my models for an Alo shoot I was on. Both the model and I LOVED the blush and she actually went out and bought it after our shoot. I love that the color goes on soft but will build well. I used a big fluffy brush and it picked up the product well. I will have these blushes as staples in my kit.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,dorla123,13 Mar 2023,"*This product was gifted to me by Haus Labs in exchange for my honest review* I adore this blush! It is silky smooth and glides on my skin seamlessly. Blending it in is no issue and a light application looks like it highlights your natural colors rather than being able to tell it‚Äôs a blush. It is SUPER pigmented, so don‚Äôt go too heavy unless that‚Äôs the look you‚Äôre going for.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Beautiful texture and pigment,jennifer07,11 Mar 2023,"I have been loving all of HL products. I purchsed this in hibiscus haze and simply love it, it's so easy to build, You can definitely go from soft to more dramatic, it such a smooth texture an applies so nice.

Perfect shade for winter blush trend on dark skin,kanna,10 Mar 2023,"This product packs a punch!

A MUST,LexisJ,8 Mar 2023,Pigmentation? Blendable? Obsessed. Need every color!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Worth Every Nickel! Exceptional!,audiemak,7 Mar 2023,"I AM OBSESSED. This is my first Haus purchase and I am a huge Gaga fan. 
This is truly more than just a blush- it transforms your face from boring/dull/grey/colorless to lively, healthy skin. Be sure to use a dense blush brush to apply, tap it on, and then blend out. I also use putty and liquid/cream blushes but they often can be tough to blend out naturally and quickly and this product is perfect to use solo or on top of a wet blush. 
I chose Hibiscus because I already use a liquid coral pinky blush, and this was a great topper for me. I have light/medium sensitive 33 year old skin that is often red due to light acne or rosacea. This color does not enhance my redness- if anything, the color balances my skin tone out or removes my redness. It's truly amazing!! I will be buying the coral color soon for summer makeup- I love this stuff! 
I love the packaging as well- you can absolutely throw this in your purse and not worry about it breaking. It's a heavy and dense container so you're protected.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
New love!,DreaminMakeup,7 Mar 2023,There‚Äôs just something special about this powder. You can build it up or just a swipe does the trick. Leaves a beautiful airbrush look without feeling heavy or cakey. WouldrecommendWouldefinitrecommendefiniterecommend,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

It's literally perfect!,acabia,6 Mar 2023,"This is one of my top five favorite powder blushes ever. Everything about it from the fact that it's talc-free, doesn't irritate my very sensitive skin, is skincare infused, is never patchy, and has the most gorgeous buildable formula to work for a wide range of skin tones? Literally it's perfect, couldn't ask for anything more. Even the packaging is super luxe!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Fav blush out there!,LukeAnthonyy,6 Mar 2023,Received this product as a gift from Haus Labs but when I say this is probably the best blush I‚Äôve ever used I am not lying.

My Fav Blush!,AliyyahKeo,6 Mar 2023,"I love the pigment this blush gives! For a beautiful natural flush, I only need to use 1 swipe. I find a big fluffy brush works best. I also love to combine 1 swipe of Pomelo Peach and 1 swipe of the dragon fruit pink, it is the besttt!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

For lovers of iconic blush..,IconLewis,28 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review‚Ä¶ I was super excited to receive the Haus Labs Color Fuse Blush in the color A√ßa√≠ Sky. The first thing I want to point out is how high-end the packaging is for the product. It just looks and feels expensive. It has a nice weight to it and is easy to open. The mirrored outer portion of the packaging is beautiful and works as well and is as reflective as the actual mirror inside the compact.  When I saw the color of the Acai Sky blush, it was rich, beautiful, and vibrant, and the pan itself was large. I was a little worried that the color was going to be too deep purple for my light complexion (I would normally go for a blush shade similar to Pomelo Peach), however I was wrong. Below are 2 photos of me using the blush for different occasions; one is on a regular day with a natural beauty glam and the other is full beat drag makeup made for the stage. This blush works perfectly for both occasions. The first photo is with just a bit of tinted moisturizer and one swipe of blush on my cheeks and and on my nose. One thing I can say, when I use this blush, I can tell it is a Clean product by the way it just naturally melts into my skin bringing out the natural pinkness in my cheeks. The blush gives my cheeks a very natural shine as well that just makes me feel like I‚Äôm glowing. Also through the day, I felt makeup continued to very nicely lay on my skin and was easily blend-able.  The second photo is for a performance in drag where I was playing a 1970‚Äôs model, one thing about the models in that time is they really, really packed on the blush. In this look I continued building up the A√ßa√≠ Sky Color Fuse Blush on my cheeks, temple, and my signature bridge of the nose. It lasted so well through the night, even through sweat and dancing. In the photos onstage my blush looked amazing. I was so happy with the color pay off. Trying this blush definitely helped made me want to try all of the colors and see how beautifull",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
This was gifted by Haus Labs for an honest review.,22acilegnA,28 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

I recommend this blush for it's versatility. You can pack on the color or go in with a light hand and build the color up to your liking. I've done both and love the results each time. After some finishing mist, the blush melts into your skin and looks almost creme like. I tend to shy away from creme/liquid make-up because I can't seem to work with it. I like how this give an illusion that I'm wearing a blush that is vibrant and hydrating when it's actually powder. I was gifted the pinkest shade, 'Dragon Fruit Daze', and I'm fair-skinned. I'm willing to purchase another to add to my collection.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Bummed.,Rach2016,27 Feb 2023,"Was so excited to try this rich color. I am very fair and I literally had to put on layer after layer to see anything and then within minutes nothing was visible! Sorry, but disappointed in a $38 dollar product.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
BUY IT,gvbynyc,27 Feb 2023,Ms. Gaga has me GAGGED!! Who would‚Äôve thought her makeup line would be this good?! Her blushes are pigmented and have a buttery texture. Ugh I am beginning to Stan her products,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Another hit product from the Haus!,albertcabrera,27 Feb 2023,"This product was gifted to me by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review!
I have tried a few blushes, but never a fan of any to adopt into my usual makeup routine. I received this blush and incorporated it into my look for the day and wow! I think the selling point for me is the application. It‚Äôs in a powder compact, but it glides on like a cream for a seamless, airbrushed look. The payoff? Pays! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve read here a million times ‚Äúa little goes a long way‚Äù and that‚Äôs exactly why I will be including this into my everyday looks from now on. I used it at the top of my cheekbones, upward to lift my face and add some color. I do a subtle look most days and that‚Äôs exactly what this blush is capable of. However, If I ever wanna spice it up, I know this blush will have me covered with more pigment! Buildable products are essential in my makeup bag! 
I also must note: I am writing this review after 10 hour wear and the blush has not moved!
Besides that here are some other things I think you should know about this product:
- no overwhelming scent
- beautiful compact
- large pan definitely worth the $38 price point!
Looking forward to new products always :)",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Do not recommend at all,anniem23,26 Feb 2023,"I actually found this to be a terrible and blotchy product.  Such a rip

Blendable and Beautiful!,SamP2523,26 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. 

Another home run formula from Haus Labs! Highly pigmented yet super buildable, this blush goes on so smooth and blends seamlessly.

It‚Äôs beautiful but pricey,emely1279,25 Feb 2023,I got this product on the shade Hibiscus Haze from Haus Labs for an honest review; I liked the product and I liked that it is buildable and works on wet skin. It‚Äôs not 5 starts only because I do think is pricey.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Staple product in my everyday-routine üñ§,jjennjo,25 Feb 2023,"I am in LOVE with this blush! As a stay at home mom to a busy toddler, my everyday makeup routine is short & sweet, and this blush adds emphasis to the SWEET! It‚Äôs easily buildable for everyday to date-night & after a long day of errands and being a mom, it keeps my face looking flush & fresh! This is now a staple in my everyday look. ALSO, the packaging is incredible. Not only does it double as a mirror, it‚Äôs durable & to my surprise did not break when my toddler got ahold of it and dropped it on the floor. This blush is truly a must have in my book!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
My new favorite blushes!!!,TaliaSade,25 Feb 2023,"Obsessed!!! These are STUNNING. When I say I had to hold myself back from buying all of five, I mean it. They are such gorgeous shades and look great on a variety of skin tones (me and the other beauty advisors tried them at our Sephora hehe).

They‚Äôre highly pigmented; a little goes a long way, and they‚Äôre also long lasting! I wore Hibiscus Haze an entire 8 hour shift and it didn‚Äôt budge. The packaging is super cute and high quality. On top of all that, they‚Äôre talc-free! Thank you Gaga - I needed new blushes in my life!!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
My new favorite blush!,BiancaaaD,25 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review! I received this blush in the shade ‚ÄúAcai Sky‚Äù and have been using it every single day since. What I like about this blush is that it is ultra pigmented (like super pigmented) and has a super vibrant color pay off. A little bit goes a long way, so it is best to apply with a light hand at first and then build it up. It feels super smooth and velvety-soft on the skin and looks matte on me. Although this shade is the darkest shade and my complexion is on the lighter side, the color can look natural and sheer by applying a small amount. You can achieve a sheer, natural look by using a small amount on a brush with long bristles like a fan brush. It is easy to build up intensity when I want more dramatic color, I use the fan brush to sweep more pigment across my cheekbones, or a regular blush brush applied directly to the apples of my cheeks depending on my look that day. My favorite part is that it is talc-free. I have gone to the gym some evenings for a light workout and the color is still on afterwards! This blush is worth it!! I plan to buy at least two more colors!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,pbeury,24 Feb 2023,I got this one and hibiscus haze one and I am in love with the pigment and colors! I have pale skin and a little goes along way,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Cool pink, mauve pink, and peach- love all 3",kmtv,24 Feb 2023,Love haus labs highlighters and bronzers so decided to try the blushes as well.

Must have blush!,Melissamaryy89,24 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. This isn't my first Haus labs product, and I probably would have purchased this if I didn't receive it to try. I am a blush fanatic and this is a must have. Not only is this highly pigmented, it goes on so perfectly. It lasts all day. I love the bright pink I received and I will probably purchase the hibiscus color as well. If you love a good blush- this is for you!!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
A  must have blush!,Shaniro,24 Feb 2023,"*This product was gifted to me by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review*

I have fair skin tone and when I opened this blush in the shade ""pomelo peach"" I thought it won't compliment my skin tone.
However, this blush is truly amazing! I put only a little bit and it looked so good! I am used to pinks but this gave me a whole new look that I love and will continue using. I would have never bought this shade but I am so glad that this i what I got. This blush is very pigmented and velvety in texture. You can build up the color. I also used it as a light eyeshadow with the blush and it looked so good a well!

Cosmetologist approved!,taylordz,24 Feb 2023,"I received an A√ßa√≠ Sky color fuse blush complementary for an honest review. This blush is the most pigmented ‚Äòclean‚Äô one I‚Äôve ever used! It feels so soft, its powder but feels like cream. My skin is very fair and the color I received is one of the deeper colors. Despite my hesitation it looks beautiful! It is extremely buildable, so for me I used a very light hand. A little goes a long way, if you are getting fall out you went to heavy, trust. I can‚Äôt wait to use this on a photo shoot. It is versatile and can execute a natural look or pack a punch for an editorial look. It would work on any client‚Äôs skin tone, especially deeper tones. I am very impressed that it can look so natural on me as I do have rosacea and blush in general can get heavy on me It wears well, blends seamlessly, and doesn‚Äôt smudge.

I am one to wear blush only if it is a super gushy or hyped occasion. The first time trying this shade was to a work event, & wow did it amaze me and my coworkers!! It was so quick / smooth to apply to my cheeks while also still get some deep pigment on my skin.  Other blush products in the past have flared my acne or made my skin feel clunky.

,jloverman72,22 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. 

I have been using this blush daily for the past two weeks.   I was gifted the shade Pomelo Peach.   I tend to go for more cool pink blushes and have honestly never used a peach-toned blush.  I was pleasantly surprised at how natural this shade looks on my fair, cool skin!  I definitely recommend using a light hand when applying as it is extremely pigmented. And I did overdo it a couple times however it is very easy to blend out.  I lam happy with the versatility of this blush as I can build it up or dial it down easily.  

Also, you get a TON of product-I was pleasantly surprised.  This product contains 0.42oz compared to some similarly priced blushes that contain 0.15-0.34g.  I feel like you definitely get your moneys worth.

My only gripe is that it doesn‚Äôt have the lasting power of some of my other blushes,.  I wear a mask at work and if I didn‚Äôt do my usual setting routine, it noticeably faded.  If I set it, it stays pretty well put, even with the mask.

Overall this product was a win for me.  I am looking forward to trying other shades and would lovvveee if Haus Labs would release a lilac shade in this formula! ;)",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

I was sent the shade Dragon Fruit Daze to try out and I absolutely loved it! I'm vegan and it can sometimes be difficult to find animal-friendly blush, especially ones as pigmented as this. I can guarantee this blush is worth the price, especially as a little bit of product goes a long way since they're so vibrant. This shade works great for bold, dramatic looks, or you can lightly apply it for a more natural sun-kissed vibe. I can't wait to try out the other shades!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Buildable pigmented color!,samiraaaaaaaaaa,22 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. 

When I first received this blush in Watermelon Bliss, I was hesitant about the color because it was brighter than what I normally used but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it. It‚Äôs super pigmented so I started off very light and I fell in love with the color! I like that you can build on the color, after the first use I became more confident and started adding more. Goes on beautifully and stays on! This is the kind of blush that will last a very long time, so it‚Äôs worth every penny. Excited to try the other colors. Highly recommend it.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Great for those into very natural looking blush,PinkRiver,22 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.
I was impressed with this powder blush to be honest. I don't personally think it was as vibrant/pigmented as I initially expected, but it does seem to give you the ability to layer on product to your desired opacity. I did have a slight issue with patchiness when layering, but not sure if it was just the brush I was using or the blush. The reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is due to it not being as pigmented as I would personally like at the price point it's at.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Haus Labs Innovation Strikes Again!,CordeliaFacade,22 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

The *Perfect* Infusion of Color,mitchymonster,22 Feb 2023,"*This product was gifted to me by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review* 

I have to say, as someone who is not a blush user, I was pretty scared to try this product; that bright pop of color, though! Thankfully that feeling went away as soon as it melted into my skin on first application; I'm a changed man. 

I received Peach Pomelo, and it is the perfect shade for my rather pale, pink-leaning skin. The color is true to tone and one swipe (using my fingers to apply) was all that I needed. Blending was as smooth as butter, and it sat perfectly on top of my other products-- I suggest layering a little Power Sculpt Bronzer underneath, for that perfectly snatched look ;-) The packaging is absolutely luxurious and quality, which is such a relief from so many modern brands and their light cardboard shells or cheap plastic. It is seriously MEGA sized-- you won't need another blush for a very, very long time. 

At the end of the day I was pleasantly surprised at how simple this product was to incorporate in to my routine, and it most definitely will be a staple now going forward. Don't let that makeup sit flat; blush it up!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
The only blush you need!,QueenKperfect,22 Feb 2023,"Disclosure: This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review on the Hibiscus Haze Color Fuse Blush. Huge thank you to the team for the opportunity!
I love convenience! I am definitely not a makeup artist and I like to put makeup on the go (in the car, on the train, on the plane etc.). This packaging is actually a mirror all around and it is super helpful for applying all my makeup! Now, when you open it, you will find an actual mirror with the perfect blush! Not sure how the team knew exactly what I want, but this is it! 
Super easy to apply (I do it with fingers, very quick-therefore you can see leftovers of my CC cream on it), very gentle on touch and on the skin, stays on all day, very pigmented but depending on the amount you apply you can get gentle or dramatic look. My preference is a natural appearance that adds warmth to my face. 
I genuinely love all Hauslabs products I have purchased so far and I was super happy and excited to be the one to be testing a new product!
In addition, I love love love how this company‚Äôs and its founder‚Äôs values for being kind to yourself and others aligns with mine, how customer friendly this Haus Labs team is and how they deliver everything on such a fun way! üôÇ",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

MY NEW FAVORITE BLUSH!!!,jesuusch,22 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. 

I was skeptical about this product at first because most high end blushes are sheer but this blush is PACKED with pigment. I dipped my brush in three times and got too much pigment but I was able to blend it out and it looks seamless and beautiful. If this is the one blush you decide to add to your collection, I would say it‚Äôs definitely worth the price because of how much product it has and the amount of pigment it has.

However, this blush is buildable and very much noticeable on my skin once I start adding more product. I‚Äôm very pleased and impressed.

Full face (almost) by Haus Labs,4Officelook,22 Feb 2023,"This (Color Flush Blush) was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for my honest opinion‚Ä¶now that‚Äôs out of the way here is my review. I‚Äôm the type of makeup buyer who shops for products I can wear to the office without drawing too much attention or looking like I‚Äôm going to head out to the nightclub after my 9am meeting. When I was gifted this product, the color made me nervous (Watermelon Bliss). After swatching it lightly on my arm I sighed with relief when I realized it was a cute color that can produce a light shade of pink (with a gentle hand). I gave it a try on my face just before Valentine‚Äôs dinner (after applying my Haus Labs foundation, Haus labs blurring powder, and Haus labs lip lacquer [not gifts from Haus labs‚Ä¶but I still love and will continue to buy]).  I think the swatch test built up my confidence a little too much and I didn‚Äôt apply as lightly as I should have; it came out heavy pink. After blending in with the brush over and over‚Ä¶and over I finally got the shade result I felt comfortable with. The blush applied smoothly and lasted well through the night. The case is way cute and is mirrored on the outside and the inside; the magnetic case makes this little item feel more secure in your hands and makeup bag. All and all Haus Labs makes amazing products that I always recommend/gift to friends and family‚Ä¶the blush is no exception. I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to trying their more subtle blush colors in the future (maybe Pomelo Peach or Hibiscus Haze)",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Blendable dream!,zacachu,21 Feb 2023,"Please note: I was gifted this item from Haus Labs for an honest review!

Ok, this blush is everything you want in a blush. But be aware it is HIGHLY pigmented. A little goes a long way so this will last you a long time. One thing I noticed right away is that it blends perfectly, giving almost an air-brushed effect, blending into the rest of your face effortlessly. The packaging is stunning and does not feel cheap. The price tag is a little steep for a single blush. But given the quality and how long it will last you, I believe it is worth the price!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

I am a newcomer to makeup, and for as brightly pigmented as this is, I found it a bit difficult to make it show up on my medium-tone skin.

I‚Äôve never tried anything from Haus Labs before but this really set the bar high for me.  I received the shade, watermelon bliss, and at first it really scared me as I tend to not go for bright pink washes. However, I was able to build it up perfectly, and it looked wonderful on me.

Haus Labs Does it Again!,AlanaBerkheiser,21 Feb 2023,"First let me start by saying I am very picky with my makeup and I have acne prone skin which means not a lot of makeup works for my skin.

This blush works wonderfully for my skin. It is very pigmented which makes it buildable. I found that on days that I just wanted a little color on my cheeks this product did great but it also did great for a night out when I wanted high pigment on my face. This product went on smooth and was not splotchy at all. 

I also found that it works lovely on just your skin as well as on top of foundation. 

An added bonus is that this blush is infused with a list of ingredients that are amazing for the skin which is great for a person like me with acne prone skin. And finally, it is talc free, vegan, and cruelty free!!

Very light! And full of color!,courtmsmitty,21 Feb 2023,"Please note: *This product was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

I was gifted the A√ßa√≠ Sky blush which is the darkest tone available. It‚Äôs like a purple-ish red so I was a bit skeptical on how it would turn out with my paler than usual skin (thank you winter!) but overall, I applied it with an EXTREMELY light hand and blended it well so that it wouldn‚Äôt be so harsh on my skin. I tend towards doing my makeup in a more natural looking way. The blush does not have the heavy, chalky feel that other brands have and gets picked up well with the slightest tough of a brush. I don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs anything extra on my skin which is a huge plus for me as I struggled with clogged pores and acne in the cheeks area.

I also am someone who is concerned about it staying on throughout the day due to sweat (I live in a very humid area) and I love going to the gym and regularly playing volleyball which often times I do with makeup on. It scores 8.5/10 the sweat factor. It does come off a tad when I towel my face but not enough to ruin a white towel but doesn‚Äôt give the bogged down reminder that I‚Äôm wearing blush.

I was someone who was on the fence about getting this product but would I buy this? Yes but I strongly recommend trying a little bit to see your shade and learn the technique of applying GENTLY. In the A√ßa√≠ sky shade‚Ä¶ maybe not. I want to experiment more with the lighter shades while I can before I can commit to it. Will this need touching up during the day? Depends on the humidity and you‚Äôre activity levels (and if using a setting spray of course!) Does it beat out the other brands? Heck yeah, the quality is here and it feels like I‚Äôm doing something healthy for my face.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
FINELY MILLED,clownplush,21 Feb 2023,"I was graciously gifted this product in exchange for my review.

First impression and comparison:

This formula is very finely milled - in a good way. I'd say it does feel like a smooth luxury blush and it reminds me a lot of a refined version of the benefit primer-infused blushes as well as the pat mcgrath blushes. 

Formula
The formula is thin (in a good way) and isnt very glowy but is definitely not flat at all. It almost silks your face to a pink/red hue rather than depositing color/pigment on top of your face which makes it look quite skin like when you apply it. It is so finely milled you cant see virtually any powder kickback when you swirl a brush in it. It can be built up to vibrancy or kept natural. 

Pricing
I think $38 is a lot for a blush in general but this formula is just as good as other very high end formulas I've tried. If you are familiar and enjoy luxury blushes and are okay with a higher price you will love this. If youre expecting this blush to change your life because of the higher price tag you might be disappointed.

Packaging
The pan is quite large and the packaging is made of plastic despite its chrome/metal appearance, isn't very heavy but doesn't feel flimsy either. 

Color
I would be very careful with picking a shade. I can make Acai Sky work on my fair olive skin but I would recommend putting a bit of loose powder down first for fair skinned people so that it doesn't appear blotchy or skippy because of the deep vibrancy, or I would recommend layering this deep shade with another blush color if you are fair like me! 

Longevity
I have dry skin that I moisturize a lot before applying makeup - live in a semi-humid environment and this blush lasted all day.

Texture:
I have textured skin. It did not emphasize my texture but didnt blur anything either. I am okay with that as I dont usually look for my blushes to have a strong blurring effect nor do I think it is a realistic expectation. Highlighter layers very nicely on top of it.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
,ryanlg,21 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. This blush definitely has a learning curve, it starts off barely there and quickly turns into too much. Once you start building up the color it‚Äôs hard to find the right amount before it becomes overwhelming. I would not recommend using a standard blush brush to apply the blush, it picks up too much product at once.  When trying to blend it back out, the color practically vanished. The application is much better with a fan brush, it‚Äôs easier to control the level of pigment you want. What I do love about the product is that it‚Äôs buttery soft and you don‚Äôt feel it at all on the skin.  It is great for someone who wants barely there color (at least with the Pomelo Peach shade). The Pomelo Peach shade is nice for light everyday makeup. I‚Äôd recommend a different shade for heavier glam looks. I am not a light makeup kind of person so this shade is not my favorite.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Great blush!,Kody13,21 Feb 2023,"Haus Labs sent me the shade Pomelo Peach to try for a review. The blush is subtle but very buildable.

Internet-Breaking Blush Formula!,PerryTemperance,21 Feb 2023,"I was gifted the Color Fuse Blush in color Acai Sky by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga in exchange for an honest review.

As someone who is an avid blush over-user, I was so beyond thrilled to receive this and it absolutely exceeded my expectations! 

My entire experience using this product was fabulous. 

The packaging is unique and luxurious. 

Acai Sky is not a shade that I would typically gravitate towards, but I am so glad that I used it! The pigment has incredible payoff, and I liked that there is sheer to buildable coverage to customize your look. I loved the feel of the blush - creamy, and so easy to blend and apply. It melted perfectly into my skin and was so nourishing! This blush was also extremely long lasting, without smudging or fading.

Perhaps my favorite thing about this blush is that it is clean, vegan, and cruelty and talc free. It makes me feel good to use it! It also is infused with skincare ingredients, which I love! 

It's a guilt-free, healthy, gorgeous blush.  I am absolutely obsessed! Cannot wait to try all the different shades!

Easily my new favorite blush.,filthyglam,21 Feb 2023,"I was generously gifted this in exchange for an honest review and I was not disappointed. I wanted to try it out in my daily routines before writing a review and it has impressed me in how well it lasts all day and how easy it is to blend to make the finish look so seamless every time. I've received so many compliments when I wear it and it pairs with my day-to-day base perfectly (including the HL foundation + bronzer) without disrupting a thing. As pigmented as it is (and she is pigmented!) it avoids the harsh first application as many blushes I've tried and instead gives you control of how you'd like to build so you don't spend so much time toning down a product that started too strong. It is versatile enough to add just a pop of color to your cheeks or build it enough to a bold, editorial-esque look, which I love. The feel is super smooth and velvety and avoids the fallout of a usual powder with strong pigment which makes it perfect for blending + control of how you want the product to diffuse, and it diffuses beautifully. The color also compliments my skin SO well, I am very happy with their choice for me.

Overall I am obsessed. From the finish and effortless blendability, to the skin benefiting ingredients (and I love that it avoids talc), I really am impressed.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Haus Labs Color Fuse Blush is an Absolute Must!,jesspeachy,21 Feb 2023,"I received the Haus Labs Color Fuse Blush in the shade Hibiscus Haze from Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. 
This is the first powder blush I have used in a couple of years because I had switched over to Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush as I wanted a product with more pigmentation. 
However, this blush delivers & she is highly pigmented! A little bit truly goes a long way. 
For application, I start with just a couple of pats of the blush brush to my cheeks, and repeated the application only once more as I tend to keep my blush on a lighter side, when wearing more colorful eye make-up. The blush blends out very smoothly, and does build nicely should you need to reapply. The shade itself is a very pretty rosy-neutral blush too. 
I love that it is a clean beauty product. I highly recommend, and will purchase in other shades in addition to this one.

Left Me In A Haze,deadlyscorpion,20 Feb 2023,This took me by surprise was expecting a bold bright color with one pass.

I love the fact the new formula is talc free so all my brothers and sisters can try it that have sensitive or allergic to certain things in there makeup.

I‚Äôve been a makeup enthusiast my entire life and when I tell you this is the best powder blush formula I‚Äôve ever tried, this is THE BEST POWDER BLUSH. You only need a small amount to apply up towards the cheekbone. If you feel like you used too much product, that‚Äôs okay because it is the most blend able blush ever. If you apply too much, you can take a fluffy big brush and blend it out. The color is incredible and stays on for 12+ hours. Will buy more as haus labs has not ever disappointed.

The coverage is so buildable, making it so easy to customize how much color payoff and product you want. It is smoothing on the skin, and looks great on top of both powder and cream/liquid products.

Blissful Blush!!,isabela7805,20 Feb 2023,"Color Fuse Blush in shade ‚ÄúWatermelon Bliss‚Äù was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. 
This blush is gorgeous!!! The packaging is stunning and luxurious. When I first swatched the color it was pigmented and smooth like butter on the skin. I initially tried this blush with a dense brush to test the pigment and WOW it was bright, but it blends to a point where the color looks more natural. Now I use a less dense brush to slowly build intensity. I was worried how this blush would apply and last because I don‚Äôt use foundation, but the powder/gel formula leaves a skin-like finish with no fallout in the pan and can last all throughout a sweaty house party!! The only issue I have with Color Fuse Blush is the price. As a university student, this is way out of my price range. I am grateful to Haus Labs for sending me this gift but I probably would not have purchased it otherwise.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Watermelon Bliss is Bliss,SJM1996,20 Feb 2023,"This product was gifted to me by Haus Labs in exchange for an honest review. 

I was nervous about this color, it was actually the color I wanted the least, but was gifted it from Haus Labs. I thought it would be overly bright and red as I usually go for something quite natural looking but I am actually in love with it! It is super pigmented, so you can definitely build it up to be as bright and pigmented as you prefer, but I used a small amount and it came out absolutely perfect!

MOTHER,CreativeGraces,20 Feb 2023,"Delighted with this Color Fuse Blush in Pomelo Peach, gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. I am again amazed by the innovation of Haus Labs. This blush radiates beauty and feels like velvet.

I started with a base of triclone skin tech foundation, followed by RIP lip liner and PhD hybrid lip oil. Next I used the Glam Room Fame palette under and on my eyes, and for some contour and highlight. Now for dessert-

The Pomelo Peach palette feels expensive in my hands. I use a fluffy brush to glide over the blush and then swirl it onto apples of cheeks and up around to the temple. Immediate warmth. I don‚Äôt typically choose peach tones on my fair skin, but this shade is extremely flattering. Reminiscent of the garden, of ripe juicy fruit. Makes me smile. Later, wearing the black shirt, I added another layer and instantly felt like a sex kitten, confidence and slay. The blush is buildable and effortless.

Today I used pomelo peach on my eyelids and cheeks which awakened and softened my whole face. A simple daytime look.

In the photos I am wearing Triclone Skin Tech Foundation in 040 fair neutral. RIP lip liner in Ride. Phd Hybrid lip oil in Primary. Glam room Palette Fame. Bio Blurring Loose setting powder in Neutral Peach. Color Fuse Blush in Pomelo Peach

I‚Äôm a blush girl, and this is one of the best blushes I‚Äôve ever tried! The formula is silky smooth and blends like a dream! It is very pigmented. You can build the coverage up or sheer it out depending on your preference. A little goes a long way! Hibiscus Haze is a beautiful color for everyday wear. I love the way it melts into my skin for a beautiful flush of color. I especially love that it is a clean, talc-free blush. I highly recommend this blush, and I cannot wait to try the other colors!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Stunning Blush!,AudreyVisser,20 Feb 2023,"This blush in ‚ÄúWatermelon Bliss‚Äù was gifted by Haus Labs and Lady Gaga for an honest review. My initial thoughts were how sleek the packaging is! It looks nice on my shelf with my other makeup and stands out nicely. This shade goes really nice with my Haus Labs Triclone Foundation in shade 230(light medium cool). Note that this blush is ultra pigmented so I start with a fluffy brush and a very light amount and then I add more depending if I want my blush to be sheer or blinding for the day. The blush itself blends really nicely with a fluffy blush. It‚Äôs super lightweight and I never can tell that I‚Äôm wearing it. Even though this color looks super bright and out there, It gives a very nice healthy natural glow- I like to wear my blush on the more sheer side, and I can still achieve that by starting out very lightly. I also noticed that there really isn‚Äôt any fallout when I‚Äôm putting product on my brush. I‚Äôve tried other powder/gel blushes and this blush is truly the only one that has managed to stay on ALL day and last a whole 8 hour shift where I‚Äôm constantly sweating. Overall, I definitely find myself reaching for this blush over other ones and I love how much product is given. I can‚Äôt wait to try other colors!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Disappointed.,theprettyybitch,20 Feb 2023,"This product was gifted to me by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga in exchange for my honest review. All opinions and photos are my own. Photo Credit/Instagram @theprettyybitch 
I‚Äôve been doing makeup for 9 almost 10 years. 
I received the color, Hibiscus Haze. The first time I tried this blush I was disappointed. This blush was advertised as an ‚Äúultra-pigmented blush with a vibrant color payoff.‚Äù It was suggested that when you apply the blush, you should use a ‚Äúbigger brush with less density and long bristles or a fan brush‚Äù. I used a long bristle, fluffy blush brush to apply this the first time. When I dipped into the blush and applied it, my first thought was where‚Äôs the pigment? I dipped into the blush multiple times because I couldn‚Äôt see the color whatsoever on my face. I sat there almost scrubbing the blush on my face to get ANY color payoff. When I was finished, I still couldn‚Äôt tell if I could see any blush. Throughout the day, I found myself constantly looking in the mirror to see if I could see the blush on my face. 
The next day, I talked to my Mom, who was with me the entire day prior, about the blush. She told me that she couldn‚Äôt even tell that I was wearing blush! Yikes. 
I decided to be fair that I would try the blush again with a denser brush. The next day I applied the blush with a somewhat dense powder brush. I tapped on the blush and I finally got some color on my cheeks. However, 2 new problems arose. First, I noticed when I tapped on the blush, it did not blend out from where I initially placed it. It really grabbed onto the foundation and stayed there. Second, it disrupted my base. I saw my skin and my birthmark peeking through. In all my years of doing makeup, I can‚Äôt remember a time when a powder blush disrupted my base. 
My final thoughts are if I paid for this product, it would be going back to the store. Especially considering the price. This product was a complete miss for me. I was disappointed. There are better ones out there for a lot less.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Most brilliant and beautiful blush!,veggielov3r,19 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. I received the shade Pomelo Peach and it‚Äôs perfect for the upcoming Spring/Summer seasons. This blush is very pigmented for being a talc-free powder formula. I love how easy it is to build up the intensity of the color and how it seamlessly blends, similar to the Velvet Bronzer. It wears extremely well throughout the day, no touch ups needed! I absolutely love how there is no powder fallout/kickback when you put product on your brush. This blush is the best blush I‚Äôve ever used!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

my new favorite blush <3,kamr18,19 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

The ‚ÄúAcai Sky‚Äù shade is absolutely stunning! I usually don‚Äôt go for a blush shade this color (darker berry) but I truly love this. It‚Äôs beyond pigmented; a little goes a long way. I like to wear my blush more sheer, so this will last me such a long time! It‚Äôs also super buildable if you‚Äôre going for a more intense look. Soft and creamy to the touch and feels weightless on my skin. I love knowing that these products are full of ingredients that are good for my skin!

I also have a blush from Haus Labs's older line of products. This one is miles ahead of the other.  I can‚Äôt wait to pick up another shade!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Gorgeous packaging and super versatile application,lawnbear,19 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. First of all, the packaging is so gorgeous and sleek - since it has a mirror, I take it everywhere! The pigment itself is extremely vibrant yet also super buildable. I like to swipe lightly and tap the excess off my brush upon first application and go from there if I want more color. It is so versatile! The Watermelon Bliss shade is typically not the color I would choose, but I love it. It's a great natural pink-red with potential for drama. Highly recommend if you want to invest in a highly versatile, long-lasting blush.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Everyone definitely needs one of these blushes,androgyneli,19 Feb 2023,This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. This blush is one of the best blushes I've ever used. It has great pigment and blends out incredibly easily and soft. When swatching the product it feels super soft and buttery. After applied the shade lasts the whole day and doesn't fade at all. The shade range is beautiful as well. I received the shade pomelo peach and it's the perfect every day color. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this product!,HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Always looking for a natural, everyday look. I have been using cr√®me blush the past few years so was curious if going back to powder would work with the rest of my products. I was gifted the color Pomelo Peach- I have never used a peach color before and was a bit intimidated but intrigued. The first time I tried the blush I was impressed. Although the color looked very bright in the pan it looks great on fair skin. Natural but buildable. Consistency is great over the Haus Labs foundation. Packaging is solid (although does show fingerprints). Love the shade range and looking forward to trying new colors. Great addition to the Haus Labs line!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
A new must have in my routine!,RaffaeleMarco,18 Feb 2023,"I was gifted this blush by Haus Labs for my unbiased and honest review. The blush is super velvety smooth and super pigmented. A little bit will go a long way. I did a full face using the Haus Labs foundation and setting powder and everything blended beautifully! If you do use a bit too much, I recommend taking some setting powder on a brush and blending it in with the blush. It will sheer out. Overall, I received a lot of compliments and many people do not even realize I‚Äôm wearing any makeup because it is so skin like. I highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a new blush!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Great for everyday wear,Brianne5000,18 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

I was gifted the Pomelo Peach shade. I must say, I was unsure about this color at first, but this warm coral color is perfect for everyday wear. I didn't know I needed it in my makeup line up! The blush blends very easily if you over do it. The blending also helps to make it look more airbrushed. That may kind of work against it to be honest; I find that it was hard to keep the pigment as I blended. Had to knock off a star for that and for price point. 

Also, just FYI, I am wearing the Haus Labs lip oil in my look as well.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Great for a Natural Flush or an Intense Blush,NixiePotter,18 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. My first impression was that this blush was super pigmented and blended easily. As I used it, I noticed that it wears beautifully throughout the day and can be built up to a super rosy blush or blended down so that it melts into a natural flush. The color I received was hibiscus haze, which I think is a really pretty shade. The blush sits nicely over my other products. The packaging is nice and it feels pretty sturdy. It‚Äôs definitely a little heavier than some other blushes I have but it is not uncomfortable to hold or use. I also really like the mirror included. My only gripe is that all of my finger print marks show up on the packaging. This isn't a big deal at all but the case doesn‚Äôt stay the cleanest when it‚Äôs being handled. Overall I‚Äôm really impressed with this blush and how it wears, and I‚Äôm already eyeing Pomelo Peach when these release!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

A potential staple in your routine,stayysayy,17 Feb 2023,"I was very fortunate to receive the blush for free as part of the Haus Labs review program, in return I just have to write a genuine review and I can say honestly this is a beautiful product. I'm not a habitual blush user, but as someone who likes to experiment with makeup and push my products to do more for me, I love this shade. It's super pigmented and easy to build without looking cakey or patchy. I used a little as eyeshadow in my photos along with some on my nose. At first I was mildly intimidated being sent such a hot fushia shade, thinking it would be too bold to wear every day but as you can see, it is absolutely wearable and blends nicely into my skin. The price is a little steep for a blush, but everything about it is meant to last and is very luxury. I can definitely see someone buying this and using it for a long time, it can definitely be a staple blush in a collection especially if one of the other shades really works out for you. It's worth it if you are currently searching for a new blush!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

I received the color ""Dragon Fruit Daze"" I immediately got excited because this girl loves vibrant pink. I swatched the color on my wrist; it felt smooth and soft, and I could tell it was highly pigmented. I used my blush brush to pick up a little product at first, and with a teensy swipe, I had this magenta hue across my cheekbone. It has a soft finish, is not super matte, and feels hydrating. Some blushes tend to disappear into my cheekbone abyss, and this one lasted for over 10 hours! I also live in a hot, humid region, so this is a plus for long-lasting staying power. I love that Haus Labs is cruelty-free and vegan. I can't wait to try more colors, and if you are looking for a new blush, I would highly recommend this one.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
This blush needs no filter!,shaylahubley,16 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. This blush is packed with pigment and clean ingredients that blend like a dream. Pomelo Peach is a gorgeous peachy-coral shade perfect for lots of different skin tones. It lasted allll day without fading and I got all sorts of compliments on it! A light hand and fluffy brush create the perfect flush of color, or it can be applied heavier handed to build your desired look without going patchy. It blends on its own and with other products beautifully for a smooth, second-skin kind of finish. I have incredibly sensitive skin and typically end up with little bumps on my cheekbones after wearing other products in that area, but not with this blush! And I have to mention THE PACKAGING! It comes in a stunning mirrored compact with good weight that just feels luxurious to hold.

SO MUCH YES.,sjc9,15 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. LOOOOOOVE. Oh my giddy aunt this is such a good powder blush with incredible color payoff. It is super buildable, so whether you like a more subtle or in your face finish, you can achieve it. I typically prefer cream blushes with a powder blush placed on top, because it gives me the best results for color and staying power. But with this blush, girlllll does it provide on both without needing a cream. Honestly the staying power is probably the biggest selling point for me -- it lasted the entire day, and I haven't found many powder blushes that can achieve that. On top of that, this shade was soooo nice on my porcelain skin. With how fair my skin is, pinks that look neon in the pan often look neon on me but whatever sorcery they performed, let the pink melt into my skin for a natural finish. Going into it, I didn't expect much from this blush but I am definitely a convert and will be keeping it in rotation and in stock.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Gorgeous color!,Gee07,14 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. Shade recieved: Hibiscus Haze. This blush is very bold and pigmented, and very buildable. I like my blush to be sheer, but with this one you can go from a sheer splash of color, to a bold and dramatic look. The formula is silky and blends very easily for being a powder! I normally use liquid blush, but this powder blush has won me over.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

All you have to do tap your brush in the powder and blend it into your skin. Easy as that!! I‚Äôm pretty fair and I was able to build it up to my desired opacity. I found this shade to not be ‚Äòtoo‚Äô pigmented upon application which is my preferred blush formula. It lasts beautifully on the skin. Couldn‚Äôt love this blush more!

Gorgeous and buildable!,megank7703,14 Feb 2023,"I was generously gifted the Color Fuse Blush in the shad Pomelo Peach by Haus Labs. The packaging is absolutely GORGEOUS and so is the blush itself! It‚Äôs definitely super buildable, so you can either go for a soft look, or something more dramatic. It also lasts all day, even without foundation underneath. I also own the Gel Radiant highlighter in the shade Peach Quartz, and this specific shade paired wonderfully with Pomelo Peach!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Gorgeous!,catherina8,14 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. When they say pigmented, they really mean pigmented. I used my normal blush brush and a light hand and the payoff was stunning! The acai color is beautiful. I've never used a blush in this shade but I love the depth it gives. It goes on super silky and lasts forever. I'm obsessed.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

"Versatile, ultra-pigmented.",23mortimer,14 Feb 2023,"This was gifted to me by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. I am in shock at the performance of this. I am used to using a cream blush, but this performs just as well. I love to use it for a natural finish, but can also build up the ultra-pigmented formula for a more glam look. Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Yes.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Absolutely amazing blush!,xDiamondGypsyx,13 Feb 2023,"I was sent this blush from Haus Labs for review and I absolutely LOVE it! It‚Äôs pigmented and very blendable, easy to work with, and the formula works with a variety of skin tones!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Gorgeous and applies like a dream,emilye96,13 Feb 2023,"I was sent this product by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. This blush is such a gorgeous and pigmented product. When I first swatched it I didn't think it was as pigmented as advertised, but once I actually applied it to my cheeks I realized that this is indeed a very pigmented product. It goes on easily and can be blended very easily. I know that the price is a bit steep, but with how pigmented this product is you don't need a lot so I can see this lasting you for a while.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"Beautiful, Buttery, and Blendable!",hausofter,13 Feb 2023,"I was gifted this product by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga in exchange for my honest review.

First, I have to say that the packaging is very aesthetic and gorgeous. It looks great just simply as a display :). The mirror packaging obviously will have some finger and smudge prints but they are easily buffed away. The mirror on the inside is excelled and nicely sized. Then the capital H stamped in the blush if so cool too.

The shade I received was pomelo peach. This is the lightest shade of the bunch, which works great for me since I am pale and very fair. It is nicely pigmented which can be hard to find in a pressed powder. Compared to the other colors you can take a heavier hand and it still won‚Äôt look ‚Äúclownish‚Äù or overdone. So I recommend this shade for blush beginners or those who aren‚Äôt too crazy about blush. For blush lovers like myself I also recommend this product. It is buildable so you can go in and have a beautiful potent yet natural look on your cheek. I used a lot and it still didn‚Äôt look cakey. However I barley made a mark in the pan so there is a lot of product in here and will last a long long time.

Next I want to talk about the texture and blend-ability. I love that it is matte since I have oily skin but it is buttery and hydrating at the same time since my skin is also very dry in some places. It‚Äôs the best of both worlds. For those with combination skin like myself it is a dream. It blends like butter and works really well over foundation or just on plain skin.

The wearability even shocked myself. I wore it for 11 hours straight without using setting spray on top. It looked just as pigmented as when I first applied. I had a long day‚ÄîI performed under hot stage lights, went to dinner, and ran errands. This was perhaps one of the best parts since my blush is usually the first to fade.

Thank you so much Haus Labs. I will be wearing this product everyday. I love it so much.

I LOVE,laurspresso,13 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. I received the shade Pomelo Peach and after wearing the blush for several days now, I will say that this blush truly stands out from the rest of my blush collection (and blush is my staple makeup product - so that‚Äôs saying something!) This powder is very similar to the Haus Labs bronzer in that it‚Äôs velvety soft, which also means that they layer beautifully together. I love that it‚Äôs infused with skincare ingredients and it is formulated in a way that sits beautifully on my skin despite being textured & acne prone. I also want to point out that the claim about the color staying true to itself on the skin is valid. I have a problem where SO many blushes wind up all pulling a warm pink on me - no matter the initial shade. This blush however, remained its true coral color all throughout the day.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
All day color with a seamless silky finish!,tatenjanes,13 Feb 2023,"This product was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. This blush feels like nothing on the skin but has the most color payoff of any blush I've ever used. The formula itself feels weightless, yet leaves my skin soft, the color blending seamlessly with the skin for a natural look, no matter the shade. I can put this on in the morning with two light swipes and it lasts all day long with no irritation or loss of color. I used the shade Acai Sky, a color that I would usually never get for myself, but it looks phenomenal. I will most definitely be ordering Pomelo Peach! I love being able to have products that are clean and GOOD for my skin!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Absolutely gorgeous blush!,drewecholsmua,13 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review

I‚Äôve very grateful to be able to test the new Color Fuse blush from Haus Labs before it becomes available! I was sent the shade Pomelo Peach and I‚Äôm in love! Everything down to the new packaging is spot on perfection. I especially enjoy how cohesive my bronzer, highlighter, and now blush look while sitting on my vanity. 

Pomelo Peach is the perfect shade of light warm peach without running too orange. It‚Äôs insanely pigmented, and doesn‚Äôt fade from my skin throughout the day. It also looks beautiful over the Blush Matte Hy-Power Pigment Paint! 

I‚Äôve worn it both as a sheer wash and as a full pop of color and think it worked wonderfully for both. Using a loosely packed natural bristle angled brush gave me a flawless application and the blush didn‚Äôt get patchy or lift any of my base/contour/bronzer products even after layering. I even used it with a fluffy eyeshadow brush as a transition shade!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
I was selected to test this product and...,Cherry2003,13 Feb 2023,"I am a 19-year old who lives in a low-income household, so it was such a privilege to receive this product. I normally don't buy high-end makeup, but using this is making me reconsider my cosmetic purchasing choices (especially since blush is a must in my makeup routine).
When I first received the product, I did look at the price online. I thought to myself, ""Should this product actually be worth this much?"" I expected this product to be like most blushes. 
What really stood out to me was how long the application lasts. Usually with other blushes, I need to reapply about 2-3 times throughout the day. With this blush, that was not needed as the intensity of the color lasted throughout the entire day on both days that I tested it (one on a full face with fouundation,  the other with a more natural look and added concealer on the cheekbones to help the blush stay in place). 
One thing I didn't enjoy at first was the product price. I thought that the price was unnecessarily high, however after testing it and seeing how little product is needed I changed my mind. This blush is definetely one that was made to last in the long run.
Final thoughts: I would say it is definetely worth the price. It is buildable and easy to apply, and it stayed on throughout the entire day. No other blush I worn has ever performed the way this blush has. I probably will not need to buy another blush but will do so anyways because of how well the performance was. Thank you lady gaga and haus labs team for ensuring this product was top-quality.

FLEXIBLE SILKY FLUSH,cdonn,13 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. The color fuse blush is unlike any blush I have tried. The texture is smooth and soft like silky velvet ‚Äì it's incredible. The color goes on almost as a velvet matte veil, it isn't overly punchy or pigmented at first swipe. The texture allows you to choose your intensity and effortlessly blend on top of other powders or bare skin.

High Color Pay off that's Easy to Build and Blend,Rosangelamakeup,12 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. Overall I LOVE the blush. This color is stunning!! It looked intimidating at first but it's this gorgeous soft warm pink. I applied it with a fluffy brush and it melted on the skin. You can use a little on the apple of the cheeks for a lifted flush of color or build it up to add intensity to your look. My favorite part is the soft matte natural finish, perfect for my skin that has so much texture. It helps to blur instead of accentuating my acne scars like a lot of other blushes do. Great product!

Acai Sky shade looks great on my complexion and it's advertised to look the same on all shades of skin, so that makes me super happy to see.

I usually don't like powder blushes because I feel like they accentuate texture, but I absolutely love this! It goes on SO smooth and blends like a dream. I received the shade ""A√ßa√≠ Sky"" and was a little worried because it's a much darker shade than I would typically choose for myself, but the formula really allows you to sheer it out or build it up as much as you'd like.

The first word that comes to mind is PIGMENT!!!!! I was graciously gifted the color ‚ÄúWatermelon Bliss‚Äù and I was shocked by how pigmented this product was. I used a bigger round brush to apply, but will definitely use a smaller brush to control how much product I put on because a little goes a long way with this blush. I‚Äôve never used powder plush, I usually stick to liquid blush and applied the Rose Quartz highlighter over top, but this blush is so amazing just on its own!

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GORGEOUS BLUSH!,AvarieS,12 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. I have to admit I wasn't excited about receiving a blush since I have so many, and they are all more or less the same. BUT WOW - I am being totally serious when I say this is so amazing I got rid of many of my other blushes! This is really gorgeous.

First the packaging. This mirror-like metal compact is very chic, expensive looking and feeling, and well made - it's stunning and is so nice to hold in your hand, or look at on your counter.

Then when you open it up, the color is so dense and rich looking you can't wait to put it on, and I didn't wait! It's very pigmented so I thought it was going to go on too dark, so I applied lightly and it was perfect. I then added more, it's very buildable, and though the color became more intense, it was not too dark or bright at all - I am just glowing! And the Hibiscus Haze is a PERFECT COLOR! I really love it.

The added plus is knowing that it is infused with skincare, is vegan and cruelty free - go Lady Gaga!

I actually have been excited to put this on every day because I actually feel like I am putting on something of quality that also looks great. And I also love putting the Haus Labs Bio-Radiant gel highlighter over it - looks PERFECT.

I am including photos of the packaging so you can see how awesome it looks inside and out!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Been using it for the last two days in my combination skin and I only retouch in case I want to intensify the pink (mostly after sun set) lol. The only thing I would change is the shade for myself.

Will be adding to my regular rotation.,HeatherM517,11 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. I received the color Hibiscus Haze. The color builds beautifully and seamlessly. I really like how it comes out lightly at first rather than full blast color. 

I‚Äôm wearing a very natural look here - just tinted moisturizer, blush, neutral shadow, powder, and mascara. I have no doubt I will also be able to use this blush when it comes to full glam.

If I could rent a billboard to say how much I love this blush I would. The texture is creamy and smooth, it glides on your skin like it‚Äôs butter. I used it tonight for my Valentine‚Äôs dinner and I fell in love. I usually go light on the blush when I do my makeup because I feel like it sits too heavy on my skin. Not this blush!!

Melted on to my skin.,afrazsingh,11 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. Here is a detailed review on the product. 1 week trial. Here‚Äôs what you need to know before you buy. 
The packaging: Super luxurious and strong compact with high quality mirror. 
The pigment: Beautiful vivid pigments. Looks just like what it looks on the pan. Note that it is not a traditional powder. It‚Äôs talc free and pressed powder so it‚Äôs not going to be a blast of pigment on your cheek on one swipe. It‚Äôs medium to full coverage so you can take your look from natural to full glam very easily. 
The application: The application was seamless. I would recommend a dense brush or a beauty blender to really pick up the pigment. I personally use my fingers to build up and then blend with a brush for that flushed look. 
The sensation: It feels like butter on your skin. It really melted onto my skin which made it look like a part of my skin. Blends like what a cream product would look like fully blended. 
Longevity: I tried it 7 days in a row. Second pic: I splashed water on my face and it stayed on. Lasted me the whole day. I would say 6-7 hours without touch up. 
Overall: Worth it. It‚Äôs a grower, not a shower. It‚Äôs medium coverage and buildable as described so don‚Äôt expect a blast of color in just one swipe. Love the skincare ingredients because it didn‚Äôt broke me out. I would buy it again.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
IMMEDIATELY obsessed!!!,joshelton,11 Feb 2023,"üíïHaus Labs gifted me their new Color Fuse Blush in Watermelon Bliss for an honest review!! üíï

As a blush enthusiast who is always finding a use for blush on the eyes, nose, collarbones, and to contour as well as traditional use on the cheekbones, I can already tell this product is going to be an obsession of mine. This blush is SO pigmented and definitely requires a light hand for those who prefer a soft natural look.  It is also easily buildable for a more dramatic look. The blush applies really well with a big brush on the face as well as an eyeshadow brush on the eyelid. It also stayed completely put when I applied the haus labs gel highlighter and glitter on top of it :)

I would definitely recommend this blush to anyone, whether they prefer a natural everyday look or want to use a super pigmented blush to sculpt and contour! I can not wait to buy it in every shade!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

I also love how this makeup is also skincare, with fermented arnica and zero talc.

Upon unboxing I was pleased with the case which has a study feel and  seems like it will hold up well and could survive being dropped perhaps. The mirror inside is a good useable size. I applied the blush and a gentle tap to the compact with a large powder brush gave visible color payoff that could work if you wanted a really subtle look. I ultimately built up with another tap for each side. I was really pleased that this blush has a natural finish that neither shimmery or overly matte. In this picture I also applied some as eyeshadow for some warmth. I took these pictures after a night out.

blends like a DREAM ‚òÅÔ∏è,KatEvangelou,10 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. 

I was gifted the shade Pomelo Peach. I‚Äôve only used this product once and I already know this is my new favorite blush‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how good it is in my opinion. Firstly, it‚Äôs extremely pigmented yet it blends so easily- like a dream honestly. High-pigment products are usually difficult to blend out properly in my experience but this product blends out almost too seamlessly! The texture is soft, buttery, and smooth. I also noticed that it almost has a blurring effect to the skin upon being applied. I‚Äôve found that the best way to apply is to gradually build up the color in layers. This way, you can customize the vibrancy/intensity of the color and diffuse it out more on the skin. Lastly, I really appreciate that this is a talc-free formula. Looking for good talc-free powder blushes can be difficult for me so I‚Äôm glad this product is a great option with such a vibrant shade range. Overall, I absolutely adore this blush and definitely will be purchasing more shades as soon as they‚Äôre officially released.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
"UNBEATABLE,  EXCELLENT!!!",Karyelash,10 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review

Color: Hibiscus Haze

I am extremely satisfied with this product. It is a beautiful color and goes well with all my other makeup byHausLabs. It‚Äôs very pigmented so a little will go a long wayyy and wow it is superrr blendable. It's not too dark or orange so anyone with any skin tones should do great with this product. I'm always a little worried about trying different brands of any makeup due to the risk of breaking out but this product did not break me out at all. It was like I had been using it forever! The color is dark enough that you actually can notice that you are wearing makeup but subtle enough to not be overly indulging or the ""clay pot"" look as my daughter likes to call it!
 I was first introduced to Haus labs by a birthday gift üéÅ from my beloved daughter,  who is a huge fan of Lady Gaga like her mommy! After trying these products!! I  purchased every single makeup piece in all colors and got rid of any other brands.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
A Must-Have Blush!,alehan95,10 Feb 2023,"This was gifted to me by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

I will begin by saying that I completely love this brand and its products! My favorite so far are the lip oils and the pencils - so creamy! 

When seeing the blush for the first time, I was hesitant about the shade. It‚Äôs not usually the hue I gravitate towards but I tried it regardless. When I swatched it on my hand, I was pleasantly surprised- I loved it! When adding it to the apple of my cheeks and brushing upward, I immediately thought ‚Äúwhat a beautiful blush!‚Äù Such a rich color - full of vibrancy and perfect pigmentation. It blends beautifully and can be layered for a bold look. 

The skincare elements in the formula makes your skin look healthy and hydrated. I am all in for an easy application and this can be used in a versatile way - I used it as an eye shadow! 

Overall, the full experience was a 10 out of 10. From receiving the package, unboxing the product to the application, I will absolutely be purchasing more shades when they hit the shelves!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
YOU NEED THIS BLUSH!!!,idkmeghan,10 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

Love it,am110211,10 Feb 2023,"This was gifted to me by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.
Let me start of by saying that I'm usually not a blush kinda girl because I'm pretty fair skinned and tend to redness anyways.
BUT this blush is amazing, it doesn't make me look flushed but just gives a healthy color and glow to my face. It goes on smooth and depending on the brush it will go on either sheer or a very intense. Its perfect for just a day by day look but can easily be intensified. The packaging is very high end and feels and looks very classy.
Overall this is a great product and with the added skincare ingredients it is sure to become a staple in my make up bag.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Big fan!,mollybeard,10 Feb 2023,"This product was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

Pomelo peach is a gorgeous shade that gives a natural sun kisses glow. Easy to build, the pigment is powerful! I love that it is also good for my skin while making my skin look good. Definitely need to get myself new brushes worthy of such a great product.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Smoothing & Surprisingly Hydrating,jsalkowsky,10 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. 

Let's start with the packaging. The blush comes in the typical Haus Labs simple/sustainable unicarton. The blush compact is similar to that of the bronzer or highlight, although this one has a silver chrome finish. I'm a big fan of the look and feel of the packaging - it feels lux but also not too clunky. I will say that this type of chrome finish tends to attract fingerprints quickly - I don't really mind this, as they're easy to swipe away, but thought I'd mention it.

The product itself was really quite impressive. Personally, I tend to reach more for cream blushes as I find that powders can dry me out, and also find that creams tend to blend into my skin more easily. However, this powder blended EFFORTLESSLY. It has the most flattering blurring / smoothing effect. Some other powder blushes I've tried can become patchy, especially when applied directly on top of wet foundation / concealer. I tend to not use a ton of face powder, so I applied this directly on top of the Haus Labs foundation, and it did not cling or pill up whatsoever.

I received the berry shade, so I used a very light hand since I have a lighter complexion. I put my brush in the pan, and then dabbed it on the back of my hand once or twice to make sure I didn't go in too heavily - this technique definitely paid off. I was surprised at how flattering this deep of a shade could be on my skin. To test, I also built up the blush to a level that I probably wouldn't usually wear, and it built up beautifully. Essentially, this blush has enough pigment to go as bold as you like but also has the versatility to offer a light flush of color.

Although $38 isn't cheap, you definitely get a ton of product for the price when comparing to similar brands.

All in all, I'll definitely be purchasing some of the other shades in the blush collection. Very excited to see that Haus Labs continues to come out with such impressive and reliable products!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Absolutely gorgeous,Katrinagaisford,10 Feb 2023,This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. I love this blush. I have fair skin and this shade is a wonderful pop of color that blends beautifully with my cream bronzer and sits well on my skin. I will be reaching for it daily and love how buildable it is to really amp up a look or just have a slight flush. The packaging is also beautiful and a good weight.,HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Beautiful!!!,StefMayhem,10 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review! I am no makeup expert but I love to be creative and do my own thing.

Beautiful Blush with Amazing Color Payoff,KellyAnn1313,10 Feb 2023,"This was gifted to me by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga in exchange for an honest review. 

I‚Äôve used this blush twice so far, and the quality is like no other blush I‚Äôve used before. I used the shade ‚ÄúPomelo Peach‚Äù which is a soft matte coral shade. First impression of the blush when swatched was how soft the product felt when applied to skin. No product fallout in the pan either. It is extremely easy to apply. The color payoff  is really vibrant and high pigment, so a little goes a long way. That being said though, this blush is buildable coverage. You can make this as sheer or as vibrant as you want. It blends beautifully. The formula feels extremely nourishing on the skin, and doesn‚Äôt appear dry or cakey. It is infused with ingredients like fermented arnica, hydraberry,  shea butter, and vitamin c. It is talc-free, clean, vegan, and cruelty-free!  Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned makeup pro or just getting into makeup, this blush is so easy to use for everyone. I can easily say it will be added into my everyday makeup routine. As usual, Haus Labs have outdone themselves again. Give this blush a try, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
NEW FAV,ItsmeKarinaS,10 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by haus labs by lady Gaga for an honest review.  I LOVEEE this blush, I usually go for cr√®me blushes and stay away from powders because powder blushes seem to cakey and unable to blend on my dry skin but this BLUSH IS SO GOOD!!! It feels like velvet on my skin, doesn‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm wearing anything. The shade watermelon bliss is the perfect sunburnt or blushing shade.  It can be super pigmented so I find using a fluffy bigger brush works best. Usually I have to reapply blush throughout the day but this blush lasted me through my 8 hour shift. AND the packaging is a great size so you are getting your moneys worth. LOVE LOVE LOVE.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Absolutely Gorgeous,alyssaclaireee,10 Feb 2023,"I received this product as a gift from Haus Labs in exchange for an honest review. I really really liked this product! Its very pigmented, so if you want to build up the payoff, start very lightly and work your

This is a fantastic blush! If you‚Äôre really looking for that color pop, this is the stuff right here. Such a gorgeous, strong pigment. It‚Äôs a powder, but it comes on super soft & smooth. What I like is that being light-handed with this will still give you a great pop of color, or you can go a little heavier & it easily builds for a more dramatic effect. I feel like I can use this blush both for casual days out, as well as other times when I need more of a dramatic look to perform on stage (I‚Äôm a professional Irish Dancer).

At first, I was a bit leery of the price point, but this blush will last a long time since one swipe goes a long way! For reference, I used two brush swipes on each cheek.

"Supercharged, Clean Blush",jcistrash,9 Feb 2023,"This product was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

As someone who has only gotten into makeup for about a year, it was a bit daunting to give blush a try. A lot of the blushes I've used have been a bit sheer and didn't blend out as much as I wanted. The Color Fuse Blush does exactly what I was looking for and more.

I tried out the shade ""Watermelon Bliss"" and immediately fell in love with the pigment from the packaging alone. The color is bold and beautiful.

One thing to note: this pigment is no joke! The blush collects on a brush easily and applies smoothly without compromising the color. You'll want to go light on the application if you want a sheer finish. Otherwise, go off!

The application felt smooth and blended out the way I wanted. The end result looked beautiful and was something that made me feel amazing! It held up throughout the day too, so that's another plus.

Best blush I have tried in 15 years !,DragonCreations,9 Feb 2023,"So let me start of by  saying I do like to apply blush a little bit more than normal. It‚Äôs  my kind of style on how I love to do my makeup. I have tried quite few blushes  in the last 15 years . For clients  when I was make up artist before or even for my own use but this one has topped all of them off . Like every item I have from HAUS LABS it has not let me down it‚Äôs a 10 out of 10 . It‚Äôs so pigmented but the good thing is that it‚Äôs buildable . So if you like a bit of blush just be gentle on not applying to much on your brush. If you like blush like I do you can build it your perfect amount.The application of it is so bendable and smooth like there bronzers and highlighters which is one of my favorite things about them . It doesn‚Äôt get patchy which a lot of blush have in the past for me from other brands . So when I saw this blush didn‚Äôt do that and it just melted in my skin like it was just my second skin. I fell in love with this blush even more . Also one of my favorite things like the other HAUS LABS products I use it‚Äôs infused with skin care products and it‚Äôs TALC - FREE !!! And I have very sensitive skin because of my rosacea so when my skin just loves a product like this it‚Äôs a big WIN for me because I don‚Äôt have to deal with rashes like I have with other brands. .I will 100% be putting my email down to get a notification now to be able to buy the other colors because I am so in love with the outcome . If you have been looking for a really good blush that is stunning and applies beautiful you need to get your hands on this blush . I promise you that you won‚Äôt regret it ! And I forgot to mention it‚Äôs so amazing  that it‚Äôs clean , vegan and cruelty- free !!!!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Really love this blush! As a natural redhead, I am very pale and bright-colored blushes can sometimes lack the buildability that I need to create a natural flush‚Äìnot this one! This formula is truly buildable and there isn't a ton of tapping off of your brush needed to get enough product. Really easy to work with and it melts right into your skin.

Another plus was the wear-time! I run warm and feel like my face makeup often melts away throughout the day. This blush stayed on ALL DAY. I got home at midnight and still had the same natural flush to my cheeks.

Finally, love anything talc-free!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Absolutely Beautiful Blush,CourtneyC512,9 Feb 2023,"For starters, this was graciously gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. I received the Color Fuse Blush in A√ßa√≠ Sky. When I saw what color they chose for me, I was like, how am I ever going to pull such a vibrant, beautiful color off? I stray to neutrals out of habit, so this pushed me out of my comfort zone and I‚Äôm glad it did. I would not have picked this color for myself, ever! So thank you, Haus Labs, you nailed it. 

As a base, I‚Äôm wearing Haus Labs Triclone Foundation in shade 175 - Light Neutral, with Haus Labs Bio-Blurring Loose Setting Powder in shade Translucent. This blush is very pigmented, so I started with a small amount and layered little by little until I achieved the desired intensity for my look. I went heavy on the eye makeup, so I didn‚Äôt need a lot to accentuate my cheeks so much. But this color is VERY beautiful on my light skin, even in a light application. 

This color is buildable, soft, lush, it feels good on your skin. The packaging is lovely and I really liked the mirrored outside and when you open it up, there‚Äôs a mirror on the ceiling - A-YO. Sorry, I couldn‚Äôt help myself. I will be adding the other colors to my collection and I also plan to do a more scaled-down look with less eye make so I can really feature this blush. It‚Äôll be perfect for this weekend at a Valentine‚Äôs inspired chocolate festival I‚Äôm attending. Thank you, Haus Labs. Amazing product!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

You can even layer two colors on top of one another, the product is light not at all cake-y very soft and smooth to the touch. These have great longevity with no irritation for my sensitive skin it‚Äôs also vegan friendly and cruelty free (huge bonus).

Let‚Äôs just get into my thoughts on this product; so my first impression of the product was great! I love a sturdy component with a mirror to survive my travel makeup bag and this component does not disappoint!

The blush itself is beautiful! I have sensitive skin that‚Äôs textured and imperfect so I love a blush that‚Äôs matte that doesn‚Äôt highlight my flaws. I applied this blush two different ways! When I was using my cream products I used a damp makeup sponge and blended a√ßa√≠ sky like a cream blush and the color was so pretty it made my skin look as though I had spent a little time in the sunshine! I have very fair skin so darker shades are a little intimidating to apply but I am no stranger to the blush game! Secondly I applied this blush with a fluffy blush brush with the lightest hand over my cheeks and nose and I‚Äôm very impressed! It‚Äôs beautiful, unscented, and the color is very pigmented! The shade doesn‚Äôt make my acne scars stand out it does in fact sink into your skin to leave a natural looking finish!

I received the shade Pomelo Peach and fell in love at first sight! As a trans woman still learning how to do makeup in a way that makes me feel comfortable in my skin, I have to say the life this blush brought to my cheeks had me feeling absolutely radiant! It applied so easily and smooth, if it weren‚Äôt for the amazing pigment I wouldn‚Äôt have even been able to know I added anything to my face. I have extremely sensitive skin so to say I was pleased with how clean the blush felt would be an understatement. I unfortunately haven‚Äôt been able to try many HausLabs 2.0 products but this was a perfect first impression in my book.",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
Warmth for Days! Love this Blush.,JLeDosquet,9 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review, and honestly, it is the best blush I‚Äôve ever used. 
I have the pomelo peach shade and the color is vibrant and very pigmented. The feel of this blush on the finger is super silky and smooth, and one swipe of my brush easily picks up plenty of product. As a fair toned person, one swipe of it is plenty for me for day to day wear. It‚Äôs super blend-able, easy to build up the color for a bolder look, and is perfect for me as a busy mom who doesn‚Äôt have much time to do full face glam every day. It adds warmth and dimension to my face makes and my skin look refreshed. I also love that it is talc free, and has lots of beneficial skincare ingredients. It feels light, and it looks very natural on the skin. A little bit goes a long way. I‚Äôm never using another blush ever again. I can‚Äôt wait to try the other shades!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
My new fav blush!,Tgirl2349,9 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

This blush is SUPER buildable!  You can wear it very sheer or layer it on to make it very pigmented. The formula is super fine but a lot of product doesn't go onto your brush, therefore you can tell the blush is going to last a long time.  Hibiscus Haze melted into my fair to medium skin, making me look refreshed and rosey. Looking forward to trying other colors!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

,akcourt503,9 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review. This is a beautiful rich color. I wore it for a drag performance and it held up all night. There was a bit of fall out when getting the product on the brush, but when I'm performing I like to really pile on the color. This color was great for what I needed it for. Lots of color with the first swipe. If you like a lighter more subtle blush look be careful not to dip too much. This color is so beautiful and will look amazing on darker skin tones. For me this color is perfect for a vampy night out look.
I normally wear a more peachy blush in my day to day looks so I'm excited to try that shade next!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes

Radiant and skin like,MevMev,9 Feb 2023,"This was gifted by Haus Labs by Lady Gaga for an honest review.

The shade Hibiscus Haze makes my skin look really radiant and healthy (something I have been on the hunt for after dealing with tired, postpartum skin). The blush is definitely pigmented but blends out so easily. The silky, soft formula melts into the skin and leaves a really beautiful, subtle sheen.

I can‚Äôt want to get the other shades now!",HausLabs,Blush,Yes
