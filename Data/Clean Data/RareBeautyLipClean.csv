,My all time favourite lip balm it is actually very hydrating and it stays on for whole day I never reapply it because you dont need to,bhupi,05 Feb 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
My new favorite lip product,This is my new favorite lip product!!! It goes on so smooth and has just the right amount of color. Great for a neutral floor or full glam over a lip stain. Not leaving the house without it!!!,SenecaGrace,29 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Hydrating, Beautiful Color, and Practical Design!","I love it! It‚Äôs super hydrating, and the color is beautiful. My lips are always dry, but as soon as I apply this product, they feel moisturized, and the coverage is customizable. It doesn‚Äôt last all day, but it does last much longer than similar products. Personally, I love the flat side because you can set it down anywhere, and it won‚Äôt roll away.",tinicb,28 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I LOVE IT!!! It was a little darker than expected but I still like it.,cheercat,27 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,love this lip gloss. Beautiful color. But it ran out so fast((,MarynaMore,26 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Adds the perfect tint,I‚Äôve gone through at least 8 of these. These are so good. They‚Äôre at the perfect amount of gloss where it‚Äôs non sticky and can go great without and with lip liner! this shade matches my lip tone perfectly and adds the perfect amount of tint that it needs,sunnkenrat,24 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Always in my bag!,I love this product so much! It goes so well with my skin tone and it smells lovely and stays for long!,Freedahh11,23 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Must have lip gloss!!!,"This is by far my fav lip gloss! I love the coral color and the texture, it leaves my lips look great and feel great! Only thing I don‚Äôt 100% love is the smell, hut that doesn‚Äôt bother me! Totally recommend!!!",Brook44308,23 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"It leaves a soft feeling on the lips, fairly hydrating and lasts long. Nearly Apricot is my favorite shade, but the other ones are just as beautiful- Nearly Apricot gives ‚Äúyour lips but better‚Äù. A must have in my purse!",greengnome2569,21 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Beautiful colour,I love the shade! I‚Äôm just knocking off a star because it doesn‚Äôt last the full day. I still love it and will buy again. It‚Äôs my favourite gloss.,AshkeyRose,20 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
So pretty,I love this lipgloss it feels so nice on and is such a pretty color. It is also very moisturizing.,Brookesss,16 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
A workday hero,"I usually walk out the door with some lipstick on but then I apply this glossy lip balm throughout the work day, usually at least twice. It truly does protect the lips from dryness! I did a lot of research before purchasing a product like this and chose this one initially because the reviews said the packaging doesn't leak. I can confirm: it doesn't! Pretty ~rare~ for lip glosses not to leak. I also really like the Nearly Apricot color, which leans more pink than orange. I'll probably pick up the rose one for summer. Wish there was a red!",DesiWoman,16 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
New favorite lipgloss!,Very moisturizing and not sticky. When my lips are dry this is perfect!,jrock7866,15 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Stunning,"Not sticky, beautiful color, soft of the lips. Love it",LCSeph,13 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Perfect Gloss and Hydration in One,"I‚Äôm absolutely in love with this glossy lip balm! It‚Äôs the perfect balance of hydration and shine. The formula is super smooth, and it glides on effortlessly, giving my lips a gorgeous, natural shine without being too sticky. It keeps my lips moisturized for hours, and I love that it doesn‚Äôt feel heavy or greasy. The subtle, glossy finish adds a touch of glamour, making it ideal for both everyday wear and special occasions. Plus, it has a very mild, pleasant scent that I adore. If you're looking for a lip balm that hydrates while providing a lovely glossy look, this is a must-have!",sanskan,10 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
ok,"very nice and subtle color, but leaves your lips sticky.",bluejasmine21,08 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Really nice colour especially for the winter. Sometimes it can be very sticky however it‚Äôs a really nice colour,Al7ki9,3 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Everyday,I had a trial of it and ended up buying a full size and I tried another color and both are beautiful! I can‚Äôt wait to try more!,chewbeccalove,3 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
YOU NEED THIS!!!,"Ok to be honest I am not a big lip gloss girl, however, this stuff is amazing. I truly love this product and the color of it. This product stays on my lips for a long time, even after being at the bar! I would 100% recommend",kkcran04,2 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,It‚Äôs nice just a little sticky when I use it. Really nice color and texture.,Sailoredith21,1 Jan 2025,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Lovely Berry Shade,"Packaging - I like that this lip gloss doesn‚Äôt spill. Also, when dipping and pulling out the wand, the product amount comes perfectly, unlike some lip glosses that absorb too much or too little of the product. For the quantity of the product, I wish there was more of it in the bottle. 

Wear test - I like that the product isn‚Äôt too sticky and the colour is visible. Both by itself or layered on top of a lip stick, it works well. This product works throughout the year for multiple occasions. I also like that the Berry shade would look good a variety of skin tones. On the downside, it doesn‚Äôt last long so I noticed I would have to re-apply throughout the day. 

Overall, this is a great lip gloss for that subtle but put together look. I have continued to re-purchase this and have gifted to others who also highly recommend.",MissEhs,31 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Very Pretty! I would recommend,"It's a really nice gloss that feels very comfortable on, however it doesn't last very long and the applicator is very odd, I can't get an even layer of the product on my lips without going over them 3-4 times. I love the color and overall one of the better lip glosses on the market!",ellieseph0ra,31 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Run and Grab üëÑ,When I say ‚ÄúIn Love‚Äù I mean In Lovveeeee ‚ù§Ô∏è I genuinely love how glossy and hydrated my lips look thanks to this gloss. Highly recommend if looking into buying this product!,marrokim,29 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Such a staple,Love this so good color is so pretty and the formula is wonderful it‚Äôs buttery and soft and last for so long,izzy12345678,24 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
wear everyday,"Love the colour and application, but only lasts a couple of hours. I own 3 and will buy more!",vbingr,23 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Repeat purchase,This is my go-to lipgloss. I wear it alone or on top of a lip color. It doesn't dry out my lips either which is a win! Highly recommend trying this,Therese11,16 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
All I needed to complete my day!,"Im in love with this product, so creamy, hydrating, and feels light in my lips, and the color is perfect and uniform. Girl the packaging is everything too!",Nelracs,15 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Favorite lipgloss,"I absolutely love this lip gloss, so hydrating and it lasts awhile. My favorite so far is nearly apricot. I just bought the nearly berry one and it‚Äôs very pigmented but I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the purple undertones .",Kalyn09,12 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Exceeded Expectations,"Bought this as what I wanted was discontinued. This has staying power! Goes on easy like a lipgloss, but has rich, saturated color like a lipstick. Was at an event and someone stopped to ask if I had refreshed my lips since getting there and I said NOPE! Stayed on all evening in some HOT conditions! I don‚Äôt think anything lasts 100% through dinner, but this has impressive coverage and staying power. Will buy again! I think it is moisturizing also.",kelc14017,8 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Color beautiful.. texture...,"It's a beautiful gloss, I'm not the biggest fan of the texture. It feel weird on my lips and is a sticky gloss. Not the biggest fan but the color is beautiful",RENTEEWS,3 Dec 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Pretty, but doesn't last long on the lips","Very comfortable on the lips with sheer pigment. It doesn't last very long unfortunately, but this is to be expected from a product like this. I like to use it as a ""topper"" over a lip stain or more matte lipstick.",,28 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
perfect moisturizer for your lips!,This is the second time i‚Äôve bought this product and it‚Äôs because i love it so much. it moisturizes my lips and gives my lips color at the same time.,GJ14,27 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Love it!! It feels delicious on the lips and is a gorgeous color!,,26 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Not really worth it purchasing,Honestly I saw the good reviews of this product and purchased it applying first time I like it after 2 3 days it‚Äôs almost half. I felt like it‚Äôs very thick portion and really sticky and doesn‚Äôt last much longer,karrss,19 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Perfectly subtle on my lips in terms of shine and color + moisturizing formula,mvlan,10 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Amazing subtle gloss, keeps your lips moisturized with such a beautiful color!!",sararj,9 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Buttery Soft Balm,"What I love about this product is the way it feels buttery soft and hydrating on my lips. What I‚Äôm disappointed with is that it doesn‚Äôt last more than an hour, requires lots of reapplication, and the wand applicator is way too small. It‚Äôs a lovely shade and moisturizing lip balm but be prepared for constant reapplication to provide adequate tint and gloss. I like it but I won‚Äôt be repurchasing it again unless there‚Äôs a few improvements made to the longevity and application design. Bit disappointing.",DrZubcic,5 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Subtle and pretty. Feels like butter! Also stays on really well. Not too sticky.,eryn626,3 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nice product to toss in your bag for fall,"Nice product that performed as advertised. Hydrating, balmy, and pretty. Rare beauty doesn‚Äôt dazzle me but I really appreciate the consistency and also that their  products are relatively affordable compared to other Sephora brands.",blueviolet21,2 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best lip product ever!,My favourite lip product ever! I am constantly repurchasing this as the formula is so buttery soft and doesn‚Äôt dry your lips out. Smells amazing,jessiazarccc,2 Nov 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I like how these aren‚Äôt too much but aren‚Äôt too little. Feels so hydrating and smooth and Perfect for daily use, even a day out running errands. Simple but a lovely tint to the lips. Rated 4 starts only cause the actual applicator is small and takes several uses to really get the lips glossy but overall love it!",madsstum,30 Oct 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,So plush! Feels very comfortable and the lightest wash of color. This will stay in my purse üôå,LittleRedM,29 Oct 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
One of my favourites,"I really really love how this lippie feels, the texture is my favourite. I'm someone who doesn't like thin feeling lip products, and this feels very thick and luxurious. The only downside though is that the colour doesn't last very long so I'd use it ontop of another product as like a gloss",qcetone,28 Oct 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love,Beautiful on your lips but fades easy and is darker then shown on the model,kyloooo,28 Oct 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

The best lip gloss/balm I have ever used!!!!,"I never write reviews but I had to for this product. It is the creamiest lip gloss/balm I have ever used. It's not sticky, doesn't have a strong smell and the colour is absolutely perfect for me! If you like lip balms or lip oils you need to try this!",paris221,18 Oct 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
New fave,Wow I absolutely love this gloss. Love the applicator and feels amazing on my lips. Going to buy another color!,beccanj,16 Oct 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Must have,"Your lips but better shade. It‚Äôs beautiful and gives a nice hint of colour to your lips. On top of that, because it‚Äôs a balm, it feels sooo smooth and is quite long lasting. I have been sleeping on these. I need the rest of the shades immediately!",BritttXo,30 Sep 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Love everything about this lip balm!!! 
I got it first as free sample but end up buying full size.",ss18,19 Sep 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Gorgeous!,I bought this product because the colour was stunning. The colour look gorgeous on albeit a touch more translucent than I had anticipated. thr colours is slightly sticky but has so scent or flavour and is comfort to wear. I wouldn't say it's long wear but does last about 2 hours.,vbingr,14 Sep 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
needs more hype for sure,"this gloss is SO good. ik the rare beauty blush is so good but THIS GLOSS??? it has such a nice finish and feels so nice on my lips, and lasts for awhile!",lfrizzy,3 Sep 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

one of my top 3 lip products,"I don't like lipstick, more of a gloss type of person. downside to the gloss is always the stickiness feeling which I hate but I put up with. Don't have that problem with this. beautiful shade,  nonsticky, comfortable, and honestly moisturizing too! love love love",SharV1,9 Aug 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Definitely a must try,"I‚Äôve been using this product for a couple of years, and it is one of the best lip balm. I‚Äôve ever owned.

Nothing like it!,"I am a lip product addict- I have tried multiple ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù and have fallen victim to hyped up products. 
This lip gloss balm hybrid is something I always come back to, this lasts on me much longer than majority of products I have and keeps my lips feeling hydrated and gives a very comfortable gel like feel and has such a pretty tint! 
must have in my everyday, and will certainly be a repurchase.",Kenaelizabeth,5 Aug 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
A must have lip balm,Love this! It hydrates my lips so well and lasts! Looks so good with a lip tint and is perfect for and everyday use. Love the packaging and doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or smell bad.,userswiftie,4 Aug 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Calling this dry lip gloss a ‚Äúbalm‚Äù is misleading,"Bought this a few weeks ago in-store bc I loved the color. When I first tried it out it wasn‚Äôt as moisturizing as a lip balm should be, but maybe slightly less drying than a regular lip gloss. It‚Äôs cute for a few hours but if I wear this all day it leaves my lips feeling dried out and I need a lip mask or thicker balm to help remoisturize them. This product is a fine lip gloss with a nice color but definitely should not be labeled a balm.",evAlin,4 Aug 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
RUN AND GET THIS,Love this so much it hydrates your lip and it is a beautiful shade will be repurchasing!,Breckybee,1 Aug 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,It is the most perfect non sticky lip gloss ever!! I would totally recommend it!,Evee27,25 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
This is the most unique tinted balm.,"I've never tried one that feels exactly like this. It's so slippy, but velvety and light. It feels like a dream to put on and nearly neutral is my favorite shade. It is lightly vanilla, and maybe that's why it's not as hydrating as it could be? It's strange because it feels so good, but if it comes off it doesn't leave any hydration behind. That's why I docked it a star. I have repurchased this because it's beautiful. I wish there was a clear that was unscented and more nourishing.",lipbalmgoblin,24 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Not Impressed,"I had high expectations for this, but honestly it‚Äôs exactly like the NYX butter gloss just $15 more. I ended up returning the ones I ordered and I plan on ordering a different brand. If you want a cheaper alternative, I‚Äôd recommend the NYX butter gloss in shade ‚ÄòSpiked Toffee‚Äô",Camrynll,21 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This product is amazing. I have purchased it numerous times. It is the perfect gloss, no stickiness at all and provides that hydration on the lips long after the gloss finish has gone. 10/10 would recommend.",Cece123c,19 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
yum,i love this product. its so good i would eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner.,usuck111,19 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!! ü§©,"I loved this product. It's lightweight and smooth on lips. I had it in shade 'nearly rose', very natural and fresh tint. The gloss stays for long without any sticky feeling to it. It makes my lips feel hydrated. Such and amazinf go to balm.",DrPorsh,18 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
I love it!!,"This product is so moisturizing and not only does it last a good amount of time on me, it also leaves my lips moisturized for most of the day even when the gloss and the color is pretty much faded. I prefer this over the summer Fridays balm because this doesn‚Äôt get as sticky as the summer Fridays. Also, I got vanilla beige in the summer Fridays balm and nearly neutral in the glossy balm and they are almost the exact same color on me! If your trying to decide which one to get, get this one!!",KatelynK08,8 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love using it after lip liner and lipstick.,I like this product a lot. Will say it‚Äôs way better than the lip oil and packs serious pigment so I‚Äôd pare it with a lip liner or lipstick. I like that it feels hydrating and doesn‚Äôt have a gross taste nor smell. I do prefer this over the lip oil and will say it‚Äôs with your money over the lip oil.,amadine,7 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nearly berry,Don‚Äôt get me wrong I like this product but was definitely disappointed when I got the nearly berry online expecting more of a wine color and it comes in basically purple. If they corrected this I‚Äôd definitely give it 5 stars for sure!,Noelle4755,6 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,This product gives a great gloss like finish without being sticky or stringy. It nourishes my lips and lasts a few hours as long as I don‚Äôt eat or drink anything.,rani2002,1 Jul 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Must have!!,"My second repurchase, i love it so much. It is really hydrating and lasts on the lips for a good time, very subtle colour for everyday use!!",lvlinbrar,23 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Favorite Lip Balm Forevermore,"I never understood the term ""cushion"" in regards to how lips feel when properly hydrated and balmed up, but that was the first word that came to my mind when trying this on and I immediately ran back to the store for another shade! I wore this so often I created an empty more quickly than any other product and my lips didn't feel or look right without it to me- this product is a part of me now! My lips are some of the crustiest, most dry things on the planet and this balm is sufficient in hydrating them and adding some lovely color to them.
In complete seriousness and realness.
I was and am always scared of the uncomfortability of makeup and how it makes me look and feel, but this is such an effortless and chic addition to my day to day looks whether I'm adding it to my work outfit or going out with friends. I've gotten so many compliments about looking refreshed and healthy with more nude shades (for me) like muave and compliments about looking pretty and colorful with the berry, which beautifully compliments highlighters and fun eye looks.
It's my personal holy grail product for lips and I adore it and the word favorite is overused, because I cannot emphasize enough how comfortable and beautiful this balm is!",RBSkinandMakeup,23 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Subtle and beautiful,I love the formula with this product. It is not sticky and feels truly glossy. I have bought it as a gift for friends and family and use it almost daily. I use another brand of lip liner with it to make it more dramatic. I love the color ‚ÄúNearly Neutral ‚Äú,,19 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Great; But Not For Me,"The color is pretty, but it‚Äôs practically my lip color. I did end up changing the color with my own lip pigments. The overall consistency was great; not sticky at all. It‚Äôs great; but not for me. 4/10",Katiiiieee,16 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Subtle non sticky gloss,Beautiful non sticky lip gloss!! I find this perfect for days when I want just a bit of colour on my lips!!,izuwudles,12 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Its alright,"It‚Äôs a nice lip balm and adds a natural shine and a  hint of color. Its super comfortable on the lips. It doesnt last a long long time, and it can get goopy if you apply too much. I dont regret buying this but I dont think I would repurchase just cause its basically an overpriced lip balm.",JennaLi,3 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I‚Äôve bought this gloss in a couple of colors and love it. Not gooey at all, feels great on and hydrating though not super long lasting. The only reason I give it four stars is that I would‚Äôve preferred just a little more tint. Barely noticeable. I have two different colors and I can‚Äôt even tell the difference when I wear them.",KaritinaDi,2 Jun 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"So beautiful, I love the formula, not sticky at all. My only complaint is the scent, it smells like metal! I get over it though cause it‚Äôs just to good.",Avabant,27 May 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Disappointing,"Felt very nice on the lips, however‚Ä¶I was expecting a deeper color like what‚Äôs shown on the box. A nice berry color- it was in fact not berry, it was mauve. It also looked streaky",Elliecarras,13 May 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Good product :),"I love this product, however I wish it can stay on longer. This product is so pretty on but only last 5-10 minutes. I love the shade on my skin tone. Overall good product and DOES NOT LEAK.  recommend this",Emily29859,8 May 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
On my second tube!,"I almost never use up a lip product, but I'm already on my second tube.  Feels great going on, lasts a long time, doesn't require lip liner (a problem as I've gotten older) and is a really nice natural lip tone",Vanngirl,7 May 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
A perfect lip gloss,"Hydrating, moisturizing, non-sticky, feels like an in-between of a balm and gloss.  Perfect pop of color. 5 star product hands down",Duchess0415,6 May 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,"I bought this product a few days ago, and I‚Äôm obsessed with it. First off the packaging and design is awesome! Easy and user friendly for everyone! But the product itself is even better.

Really nice!,"First off: I love how this is genuinely a balmy texture, not like a gloss at all, like a thicker lip balm. the color isn't fully shown in the camera but it's a very natural pinky coral, perfect for everyday. As well it's surprisingly long lasting, lasting up to two hours full shine. Then gradually fading.",Kezit4e2,23 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

On My Fourth Tube!,"Finally, a gloss that actually makes your lips feel moisturized.  I am purchasing my fourth tube and I have never repeatedly purchased another lip gloss this many times.  The Nearly Neutral is my go to lip gloss.  It provides a very soft level of color, to punch it up I use a Rare Beauty lip liner all over my lips underneath the gloss.  I have two of the other shades as well.  Selena, please never discontinue this!",Suzel,14 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,This is a great lip product and I would have given it five stars but the color is just way too cool of a pink to be flattering on anyone neutral or warm. Wish there was a more universal or warm shade of this pink! Feels like a combo between a lip oil and lip gloss.,AshleyLynn92,5 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best Product On This App,"Genuinely one of the most underrated products on this website. This is hands down the best lip balm I‚Äôve ever tried.

Not sticky at all",applepz9,5 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love it!,Love it! It‚Äôs so smooth and it‚Äôs pretty long lasting. The packaging and applicator are also awesome. Would definitely recommend. It looks great on your lips and I loved the shade nearly apricot.,faithk06,4 Apr 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Perfect gloss IMO - lightweight w/ subtle pigment,"Originally, I had purchased the shades neutral and mauve and became so obsessed that I bought the apricot and berry shades as well. Texture is light and not too sticky (less sticky than Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm). Pigment is subtle and sheer which I prefer since I hate when pigment settles in the creases of your lips. Also love the applicator shape - point allows you to get precise and the sides allow you to fill in. Highly recommend!",changstein,19 Mar 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

"Such a beautiful, unique product!","This is the most unique lip product I‚Äôve ever used. It‚Äôs very shiny like a lip gloss, and leaves a sheer wash of color. However, the texture is that of a very moisturizing lip balm. It wears beautifully, after the shine wears down a wash of color remains. This is the only lip gloss product I‚Äôve ever used that has left my lips feeling nourished and so soft. It‚Äôs not sticky at all, I will definitely repurchase this.",Tina000,26 Feb 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

A must for gloss lovers,This is so pretty! It keeps my lip hydrated and shiny while not being sticky.  The shade Nearly Rose is such a pretty pink color.,Ccarina111,4 Feb 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Beachy Goodness,"This is a pigmented balm, not a sticky, shiny gloss.  If the wind blows your hair across your face and sticks to your lip gloss and ultimately smears, you need this balm.   I spend a lot of time outdoors and wanted a lippie that didn‚Äôt give me a ‚Äúmade up look‚Äù but was hydrating and had a tint.  Balm has great, subtle colors and is fairly hydrating.  Probably lasts 2-3 hours after application so reapplying is necessary.  At $20, it‚Äôs very reasonably priced and I will definitely buy more and keep them in my beach bag, sling bag and backpack. Just waiting on summer now.",Socanative,3 Feb 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I really liked this at first but I started to find the formula slightly sticky over time. I didn‚Äôt love the colour I got either but that‚Äôs on me!,Quiano,3 Feb 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Lip balm ?,"I have nearly mauve and nearly neutral. These are great!! Pigmented and they feel like a lip balm!! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs moisturizing or not, but they feel like it!",leellia,3 Feb 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Is truly a balm and a gloss in one.,I have three shades of this lip gloss/balm and I do feel as though the gloss/balm title is spot on.  It gives a glossy finish but a balmy feel.  The shades are not super pigmented but do offer a bit of differentiation.  There is a slightly sweet scent that dissipates quickly upon application. You can easily re apply these with no mirror.  The formula does not settle into lip lines at all and wears off nicely.,missjeanie,28 Jan 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Looove,i really like rare beauty‚Äôs products. my only issue with this is the packaging. i hope they can match it for their lip oil. for almost everything /a little goes a long way/. same for this gloss. my first shade was nearly mauve (really great my lips but better shade for me). nearly berry is my second and i love it. like my lips but even brighter. it‚Äôs good! if you‚Äôre into RB then this won‚Äôt disappoint.,mi0ch4n,28 Jan 2024,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

"Simple, stunning, and not sticky!","This product is just amazing in every way. From the no roll bottle, to the applicator that doesn‚Äôt get the gloss on it, and just the outstanding formula. It‚Äôs a stunning must have to any lip gloss lovers collection, or to someone interested in a natural and gorgeous gloss.

This lippie is Soooo good! I want it in every shade now. Especially nearly rose & nearly berry, for fall. I have a light skin tone-and think that would be absolutely stunning!!

Will keep buying,"I love this lip gloss, the pigmentation looks great and it keeps lips feeling hydrated for a few hours",nadin00,14 Oct 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
My new go-to lip gloss!,"I bought this with a gift card as its not one of the cheaper products out there. I'm a tomboy who loves a more natural makeup look. My lips are also on the dryer side so I need all the hydration help I can get. When I saw that this was a more neutral color, I figured I'd give it a shot and I'm glad I did! 

First, it looks so natural - ""a my lips but better"" kind of look. It definitely gives a nice color with a bit of shine. For a lip gloss it's fairly well-lasting and not sticky but does need to be applied once every few hours to maintain the look. It's also fairly hydrating I which I think is important as we head into the colder months.

Overall, I'd recommend this because it is natural looking, long wearing for a lip gloss and is hydrating. I'm planning to now get it in other colors!",Livvygirl97,14 Oct 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!,"I had high expectations for this lip balm, and OMG, it blew my mind. This is the most cushy and moisturizing lip balm I‚Äôve ever used, and it stays on the lips longer compared to other lip balms. Amazing!",uchocolate,11 Oct 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
best lip product on the market,at first it‚Äôs a little sticky but the amount of hydration it gives makes me not care at all. i stopped using aquaphor at night. i just use this. IT DOESNT STOP MOISTURIZING. stays on forever. so natural. love.,shadenah,11 Oct 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

The greatest lip balm!,"I love to put lip gloss over my lips but do like how sometimes it bleeds or interferes with the lip color. This does not budge or cause lip color to bleed. It is amazing. Alone, it‚Äôs  moisturizing and leaves the lips supple.",Irene415,27 Sep 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Semi-opaque lip balm with plumping/tingling effect,"I got this lip balm in a Sephora Favourites kit and its pretty good. I wish it was mentioned somewhere in the description that it has a mild plumping effect as it took me by surprise the first time I used it. For the first 5 minutes of wear, there is a slight tingle that feels warm on the lips but eventually goes away. Its the second Rare Beauty lip product I've tried that didn't mention the tingling effect. The colour is fairly opaque for a lip balm and it stays glossy for a an hour as long as you don't drink/eat. The Nearly Neutral shade is more of a medium warm brown, not really a neutral pink. I likely won't repurchase once I finish but I don't dislike this product. I'd probably pick something else over it though.",ricebunny,26 Sep 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Great everyday lippie!,I looooooove this so much. It‚Äôs super super moisturizing on your lips. The color is so beautiful and pigmented. I don‚Äôt go through lip products so much anymore but I‚Äôm almost out of the neutral shade!,duuong,25 Sep 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

It's not sticky or grainy feeling.",lwoods35,6 Sep 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

it *is* sticky,"The colour and finish of this product are stunning but when I smack my lips together they *do* stick. Even after I remove the product using micellar water there's a sticky residue.

"Long lasting, moisturizing, rich color, not sticky","Big fan of this. I bought this on a whim since I loved the Rare Beauty mascara so much, and I am a big fan. This has a lot of color (it's not super sheer, which I expected from ""nearly neutral"", but I quite like the color so I'm ambivalent), unlike the Dior lip oil, which provides just a hint. It's also way less sticky than the Dior lip oil (which costs 2x), but it lasts nearly as long (several hours - I put it on this morning at 9 am and it's almost 2 pm and I've had two meals and a cupcake and am just now about to reapply). It's my first time using so I don't know how long the moisture feeling lasts, but I'm hopeful. 10/10 (or should I say 5/5?) will buy again.",steelharmsy,22 Jun 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Feels Good Looks Dark,"I love Rare Beauty and I wanted to love these but I haven‚Äôt found a colour that I like. The balm feels nice and thick, buttery, not sticky. I thought neutral would be a safe choice but it shows up very dark and honestly looks super similar to Nearly Mauve on the lips. I wish more of the products were actually less pigmented for a more natural everyday look.",camiimarii,13 Apr 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"It has a super weird, VERY thick texture that feels awful on the lips with little to no colour payoff",Afogg,8 Apr 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Hydrating and pigmented,My lips get dry easily so I‚Äôm super glad that this is both hydrating and pigmented at the same time. Feels very light on the lips and gives a pretty glossy finish!

Beautiful in every way,I love this gloss. I'm getting all shades. It isn't a super shiny gloss that leaves my lips looking like an oil slick attacked my lips. It gives the perfect shine and looks great on top of lipstick. love love love.,MyDadsMissy,7 Apr 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,I love this balm! it‚Äôs hydrating but still gives a beautiful colour,AHEM,6 Apr 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
New favorite after finally splurging a little :),"I‚Äôve wanted to try a rare beauty product for a long time, but never could decide what product to go for. I usually use mostly drugstore products, but like to splurge as a treat once in awhile. I tried looking for a dupe and figured it couldn‚Äôt be much better than my nyx butter gloss in praline/Madeline. Upon first application I loved it and it feels lighter and more buttery/silky compared to nyx‚Ä¶BUT what made this something I will always continue to get is- 
#1- I have very sensitive/reactive lips and this was comfortable to wear, no irritation
#2- how it wears/fades gracefully
With butter gloss I‚Äôm usually left with some gloopy edges remaining (I don‚Äôt use much either) once the center faded. This product made my lips look exactly how I‚Äôve always wanted them to, fades in a way that I don‚Äôt have to worry about it. And with just this one product too, no liner or lip color needed! My lips looked fuller and not matte, but also not way too glossy (looks great for no makeup days or nights out) I can say I‚Äôm fully obsessed with this (specifically in nearly neutral) and will purchase it as long as they make it :)",Masyn812,5 Apr 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

No pigmentation,Feels soft and nice on my lips but not pigmented enough. Looks like I just apply a thick layer of vaseline on my lips. Not worth the hype in my opinion,joytran,1 Apr 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nice,"I‚Äôm a little picky, but I like this. The texture and feel is not sticky at all. Very smooth and light but still moisturizing after a long time. My only problem is I thought there would be more of pigment",itsjennyyypan,1 Apr 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Not worth $20 for a gloss!!,"The feeling on your lips is decent, but it doesn‚Äôt last more than 10-15 minutes. I swear it literally disintegrates because it disappears without even touching my lips! I was super disappointed.",CamilleRoe,31 Mar 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

On my third purchase!,"Just repurchased my third lipgloss! I love how moisturizing it is. I am one of those people that needs something on my lips 24/7. The coverage is light, but visible.

HOLY GRAIL LIPGLOSS,"Honestly my FAVORITE lipgloss right now. Nearly berry is such a perfect subtle berry tint, it‚Äôs divine. I‚Äôm on my third tube.

Staying power,"Was I expecting the moisture? Of course. Was I expecting the just-enough color to pull together my WFH video call makeup? Yep. Was I expecting the sheen/smoothness and minimal stickiness? Uh huh.
What I wasn't expecting was the insane staying power. Seriously. My boyfriend sent a photo of my morning coffee mug after a spin in his dishwasher, and the smudges were still there! Not even kidding! But seriously. One application lasts hours if you're not eating or drinking anything crazy. 2 applications a day and that's it. Amazing.",agtoro,15 Mar 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,I looooooooove this lip balm. I walk around feeling myself when I wear it & it isn‚Äôt super sticky like some others I‚Äôve tried. It also doesn‚Äôt dry out my lips. I‚Äôve never been a fan of those dry cakey matte lipsticks so I may be biased.,MistyJQ,8 Mar 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

"Great for dry, chapped lips",I was looking for a new lip gloss/oil/mask since Sephora stopped carrying the Tarte Maracuja lip oil and I learned that Laneige isn't cruelty free. I was reading around and it looked like this one was a good replacement and since I really liked their blush I decided to give this one a try. I have lips that gets dry and chapped easily and this one made them feel soft and smooth without being sticky. I hope Sephora doesn't stop carrying these because I will definitely be repurchasing. lol,Christine06,3 Mar 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

A hydrating lip product!,"This color is beautiful! I use this every day for a hydrating pop of color. I'm so used to lip products drying out my lips but this actually hydrates them, I'm in love!!",Therese11,24 Feb 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
For fast talkers this is a no,After i got this lip gloss in shade nearly neutral and i put it on i thought it was okay. It was sticky so if you tqlk fast this is a no go and has a buttery feeling on the lips.,slayqueenshield,24 Feb 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

A10,Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the applicator. Otherwise this is solid. I love the shade I picked up and I also wanted to note that this ‚Äúlip gloss‚Äù the name suggests is more of a lip balm hybrid so don‚Äôt expect super super glossy.,ParisCat19,10 Feb 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Honestly confused with the reviews. Maybe I got a bad batch but it looks almost clear like Vaseline. I bought 2 colours and can‚Äôt tell which is which as it barely has any pigment. Not impressed.,ysa99,9 Feb 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

New Fave found,"When i first got this lip gloss, I wasn't too excited. I thought that it was too expensive and that there must be drug store lip glosses that are the same. But when I tried it, it became my new all time favorite. First it looks so good on the lips, a shade that I believe is universal. Second, there is something about the formula that makes you want to put it on more often. somehow, souffle like and cushiony but also very glossy. I totally recommend.",Tuha02,5 Feb 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Beautiful neutral lip colour,"Though I‚Äôve only ever tried this on myself, I feel this could be a fantastic universal shade. And I LOVE the package design - the flat side prevents it from running away from you during prep. Will buy again!",RachelTheRED,4 Feb 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Amazing!!,So comfortable and hydrating. Nice light tint but beautiful color.,hmwest2005,30 Jan 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

I love this lip gloss!,"At last, a lip gloss I love! Creamy, never tacky, it doesn‚Äôt dry out my lips. After it‚Äôs worn off, it doesn‚Äôt leave a gross residue, either. The shade Nearly Berry is my favorite. Perfection!",vfromphilly,15 Jan 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Smoothest Lip balm I have tried,Applying this lip balm is so satisfying and it‚Äôs not very sticky. I can feel that it moisturizes my lip although the color is not that visible. I kinda love it,Nel93fdo,13 Jan 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Ehhh,I wanted so badly to like this product!! It might just be my lips but the color payoff is hardly anything at all and looks more like a clear gloss. it just feels like a thick chapstick with 1 swipe but if you add more layers to try and get any kind of color payoff it starts to feel sticky and even more thicker.,kylie820,12 Jan 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

STAPLE in my purse,I got this in-store and knew as soon as I saw it was the last one that I had to grab it. This leaves my lips moisturized and stayed on for a good amount of time. The shade can be opaque and it can also be a little more transparent depending on what you are looking for. This is definitely an everyday lippie!!,IsabellaJA611,2 Jan 2023,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
My new fave!,"I was looking for an unscented lip gloss that didn't feel sticky. THIS IS IT!!! As others have pointed out, it's not super pigmented but pigmented enough for me.

Sooooo good! Will be buying more!,"I don‚Äôt usually leave reviews but WOW this is by far the best lipgloss I‚Äôve ever used. The colour shows up very well and it‚Äôs super flattering! It‚Äôs also soooooo moisturizing, it genuinely feels like chapstick",babyitscaitiee,16 Dec 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Everyday must-have,I originally bought this in the Nearly Apricot shade and fell in love with this formula and how hydrating it feels.

It‚Äôs okay,"This product is fine but definitely not my favorite from Selena‚Äôs brand. I like the sheer color and it‚Äôs not sticky.

Soft as a Cloud!,"I love this gloss! It‚Äôs soft and hydrates my lips throughout the day. I love that it melts and acts as a lip balm. It doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or gloppy like most glosses.

All Time Favorite,"This has everything I've been looking for in one tube! I'm not a lipstick gal, and definitely not a lip gloss gal. Long-lasting mattes are too dry, glosses too sticky, and opaque colors just aren't my fave for every day. I did SO MUCH research to find this balm, and it's my new obsession! I adore the satin finish, and it never feels sticky - just moisturizing and sleek like a balm. The color is sheer enough to wear without any other makeup, and just enough to make a full face of makeup look finished. Nearly Neutral is the perfect ""your lips, but better"" shade on my skin tone, too. Random bonus, the tube has a flat side, so it doesn't roll off my vanity! Selena, you nailed the details!",sigma168,4 Nov 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

HG,"i always go back to this glossy balm if i have zero idea what lip i'm going to wear for the day! the colors are gorgeous. the hydration properties are splendid. feels so smooth and nice on the lips, and the glossy finish is the cherry on top. even as the shine fades away throughout the day, it leaves the slightest tint and it looks so nice and natural. as if i'm not trying too hard, just enough. love this gloss balm so much!",Franchieee,2 Oct 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
A little sticky but love it!,This gloss can get a little sticky but the stickiness goes away about an hour after application. This colour matches the natural colour of my lips very well and the gloss is very hydrating. As the name says it definatly feels more like a liquid lip balm than a gloss but it can be used as either.,EmilyManaba,1 Oct 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

So underrated!!,"Wow! I‚Äôm so pleased with this product. I was hesitant at first because I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the lip balm or lip souffl√©, but this might just be the best lip balm-gloss I‚Äôve ever tried! I‚Äôve been wearing it literally everyday!! I have perioral dermatitis and therefore very dry and sensitive lips. But this product is one of the few that never causes trouble for me and always looks so beautiful, especially with the rare beauty lip liner. It is so buttery smooth and hydrating with a healthy shine. Definitely going to be purchasing more colors!",lemii,29 Sep 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"My review is no different than everyone else's; I received a sample of it and I'm addicted. I obviously have no choice now but to buy them in every color.

This is my new everyday lip product.,"I got a full size of this in the holiday set and I can't believe how incredible it is. The nearly Neutral color offers a slightly flushed look without looking like a layer of color, and the glossy finish is amazing. this gloss has the distinct quality of not sticking to itself on the lips. 
You know what I'm talking about. 
When your lips press together and you separate them, you can feel the gloss separating from the gloss as it goes. This gloss doesn't stick to itself. It's freaking magic. 
It makes me curious about the rest of the products in the line as the quality of this one is out of this world.",o3mta3o,22 Sep 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

As someone who struggles with the texture of sticky lip gloss, this is a game changer. Its smooth and buttery on the lips, and looks like the perfect glossy lip without the sticky mess of gloss.

The color actually lasts which is great since, my lips are naturally very ‚Äúill-looking‚Äù without any lip color applied due to how pale they are.

After I gave it about 15 minutes to ‚Äúdry‚Äù it felt more like a balm. I was able to eat, and drink my coffee without any mess or bleeding.

"Eh, nice colour but not too happy with the formula","Purchased in the shade berry, January of last year so I've tested this product for some time. The formula is kind of similar to Vaseline and is more of a lip gloss/lip stick. Taste and smell wise, there isn't much of a smell or flavor. 

Reason for stars been deducted: 
The colour does not last and at the same time transfers. I usually avoid wearing this lip gloss as it stains. It stains my water bottles and any cup that I drink out of, the stain does go away. However, I accidentally got some of the lip balm on a white cotton t-shirt. I have tried vinegar, dish soap, baking soda, oxy-clean, oxygen bleach, tide pen, and chlorine bleach and nothing. 

Also, I did mention that the formula is similar to Vaseline. I dislike wearing this lip gloss if I'm talking for a long time as it leaves that Vaseline feeling on my teeth, it's kind of similar to how Vaseline is used in beauty pagents so that you keep smiling.",DianyT,1 Aug 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

The amount of color is perfect. It's very neutral (lol). This is a product that I would feel very confident in it through out the day. I'm obsessed.,KamiiBee,27 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Practically no pigment once applied. I was super disappointed. I might return.,Arusu,27 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Low maintenance and moisturizing,"I've been trying a LOT of lip products lately in the category of ""effortless, hint of colour, easy to throw on with no makeup or to polish off a natural look"" lip balm ish stuff. This is my favourite so far. Tints are hard for me because I have dry lips, and the colour stains dry skin vs. moisturized skin differently. Tinted solid balms are fine, but nothing special. THIS... this is special. The closest product to it is the original Fenty Gloss Bomb, but this is somehow both less sticky and tacky, and also less emolient??? Like, it doesn't feel as thick, and yet is also doesn't move around as much. Anyways, if you, like me, want a little hint of colour that you can apply without a mirror, like nourishing products, like the Fenty Gloss Bomb, and want the lowest possible maintenance... this is for you!",sarahmg,27 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Literally so good, it‚Äôs so creamy and hydrating and looks good with any lip liner.",Jacygee,27 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Perfect everyday lip product,This is my absolute favorite Rare Beauty product. I take it everywhere with me. Nearly Apricot is the perfect shade for me because it looks natural but adds a nice pop of color. I also have the nearly mauve shade and love it. It‚Äôs super hydrating and lasts for a long time.,shelbyfort,25 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Nearly Neutral is such a pretty color. Kinda reminds me of lip glosses girls used to use in y2k. It‚Äôs not too sticky.,DJ18,23 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
yes!,"This is a gorgeous color, and it stays!! It has a little bit of stickiness to it, but I prefer that. Super light weight and I‚Äôm v impressed and buying more colors. This is def the most underrated product!",ktlee03,23 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
love this!,love this lip gloss. such a nice velvety texture that isn‚Äôt sticky but still looks like lip gloss. love the colours as well!,gillianruss,22 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
BEST GLOSS BALM EVER,"People are sleeping on this gloss. Such a smooth, soft, and silky texture that coats the lips. Not sticky or tacky at all. Feels like a balm more than a gloss. Pro tip: Use a balm first and then the gloss to lock in extra moisture. Love!!",Jadrienne,19 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Will be buying this again!,I don‚Äôt usually wear lip gloss but decided to try this one after seeing tons of great reviews. And I am so happy with this product! It‚Äôs long-lasting and hydrating. I love the colour as well.,marshellie,18 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
LOVE THIS,"This lip gloss is AMAZING! It is so smooth and moisturizing, I bring it everywhere! It has a beautiful tint and feels so good on my lips, it is almost like a lip balm! The colour I choose was a bit darker than I expected but I can definitely make it work:) it is a product I would buy again and again and I can‚Äôt wait to try the other shades! Another thing I love about it is the packaging, it is so pretty!  I that there is a flat side on the bottle because it doesn‚Äôt roll around when you set it down! The wand is a bit small for my liking but it does pick up a lot of product!",islaymcleod,18 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
AMAZING,"bestie, this is the best lip gloss . do not think twice just add to cart",olgabr,17 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Great lip gloss. It has a soft and creamy feel when you‚Äôre apply it. My go to lip gloss use to be Fenty but now I added Rare Beauty as well. I will be repurchasing!!!,StephLover5454,17 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
love this!!,"I have really enjoyed this product! For 0.1 oz, it is a bit pricy(though still costs less than a lot of lip products at Sephora), especially since it doesn‚Äôt last very long on my lips; I just adore the feeling and happily reapply. It really does sink into your lips and soften them, but if you are applying primarily for the color and gloss it may disappoint you. The sensorial feeling of them I am just obsessed with. It is ‚Äúcushiony‚Äù soft like a balm- not really slippery or oily, like a gloss. I have all 5 shades now and have even repurchased several of them, the past. The shape of the component/applicator is misleadingly large and also makes it impossible to get the last little bit out of the tube, but I still enjoy the doe foot anyway. The packaging wouldn‚Äôt be as pretty as a squeeze tube!!",permegan,16 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Dreamy,"If I could rate this higher, I would. It is perfect. I have purchased other shades of this formula and I recommend it to everyone. The colour is so flattering and it lasts. I stopped wearing so many lipsticks and glosses while wearing a mask but I reached for this every single day. Obsessed!",Bluebooda,15 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
New favorite,I love the color and it feels so smooth on my lips!,kittyprime88,14 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
very bold and vibrant,Beautiful color feels very hydrating. I‚Äôm not one to wear red lipstick but when I do it will definitely be this one right here.,aliciamcee,14 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
pretty gloss,It has a nice creamy but not sticky feel and isn‚Äôt too thick in consistency. The only negative is that not a lot of product comes out on the applicator. I love this over the lipstick praise!,angelitron22,14 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Must have,Color is great and it‚Äôs not sticky. It‚Äôs become a must have for me. Currently on Accutane and this provides moisture with a hint of color.,Nina3606,13 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
If your one the fence‚Ä¶,"Amazing! I have no words honestly. The formula goes on so well and the colour is just *chefs kiss*. I know, it looks super dark in the tube, but it isn‚Äôt once applied. It goes on so well! The colour makes the lips look super lush and healthy. I will be buying more whenever I run out because this is a must have!",Donnasaur,6 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Beautiful color, texture and wearability. Felt luxurious and very hydrating. Color lasted for the better part of my day",easselin,3 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

love love love,this this such a pretty shade and it works great for pale ppl. and its super hydrating but still pretty gloss like. not sticky at all and adds a pop of color to your face.,captain14,1 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,this shade. this formula. this packaging. this is everything i want in a lip formula. lasts awhile for a ‚Äúgloss‚Äù and leaves the lips moisturized. 10/10 for me,kariamanda,1 Jul 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
more balm then gloss,I got confused by the ‚Äúproduct name‚Äù and product ‚Äúdescription‚Äù it says ‚Äúglossy lip balm‚Äù but also says satin finish. It is very emollient I would compare the feel on my lips to Jack Black Lip balm. I would not describe it as glossy but rather lustre or sheen. It‚Äôs a little too thick for my liking as a hybrid product. For reference fenty gloss bomb was my go too but then for price I also tried tower which I much enjoyed. I got a trial size I will not be purchasing. My favourite thing about this product is the colours which are very natural and muted,BerryBeauty92,28 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
It's a MUST have staple!!!,"Literally OBSESSED with this gloss. it's velvety soft on your lips. Not sticky in the least bit, and has the perfect level of shine. And it's the perfect amount of color even if you're a POC.(which can be hard to find). I love using this with a brown liner for a perfect sexy natural look. I always end up having to buy it for my  friends once they try it! Definitely don't hesitate to buy.",ChiBee,28 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

don‚Äôt understand the hype!,this is an average lip balm/gloss. it is a nice texture and not sticky but the color is not doing it for me. might try a different color,ellestinson,22 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Love rare beauty products but these lip balms have zero tint and no hydration either. It does not stay on long.,ttarteaga,22 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
so amazing!,"this is the most moisturizing and long-lasting lip balm i‚Äôve ever had. the texture is like a gloss, but it‚Äôs not too much. the nearly neutral is such a nice color and it‚Äôs so natural. it keeps my lips moisturized all day and i love it!!",ktriceratops,22 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Favourite lipgloss!!!,"I normally don‚Äôt enjoy wearing lipgloss because of the sticky feeling on the lips but this rare beauty gloss is a game changer. Doesn‚Äôt feel sticky at all and it‚Äôs the most beautiful neutral shade. It‚Äôs become my go to. I love wearing it on its own, with a lipliner, or over a lipstick (specifically the Mac spirit lipstick is a beautiful combo). Would definitely recommend!",KiranCheema,20 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,Love this!!! Very smooth and hydrating! It is so flattering on any skin tone! I use this daily with any look!,JoyYoung,12 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Love this product and love the shade. It just didn‚Äôt give it 5/5 bc I imagined the colour to be more of a pinky to mauve shade but it appears more corally / peachy on my skin. Overall I still love this product,rayerr,9 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Pretty and comfortable,"Really lovely lip gloss that feels like a moisturizing balm. It‚Äôs very light on the lips, not sticky and completely free of shimmer/glitter particles, which I personally enjoy. I got a sample size of ‚Äúnearly neutral,‚Äù which is a lovely sheer wash of color and shine that compliments my natural lip color and I think would look good on everyone. I would compare this product to the BareMinerals gloss balms but even lighter and more moisturizing. The scent is very light and dissipates quickly once applied. It smells faintly of vanilla. I plan on purchasing the full size once I finish the sample!",Haylee09,7 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best lipgloss ever ..my new favorite,Omg my most fav lip gloss ever.it‚Äôs so hydrating and also not sticky at all.it‚Äôs stays in my lips all day long it‚Äôs almost like a beautiful lipstick.works even better when you use it with a lipliner,abiyaan,6 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"So hydrating and nice! It‚Äôs not sticky or gooey, it‚Äôs just lightweight and wears really nicely",brianna721,5 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Disappointed,"Overall, the quality of the gloss balm is fine. The texture is soft and creamy, however, it does not lay evenly. Another issue is the applicator which is poorly designed and does not apply the balm evenly. I had to play with it a bit until I could properly apply the gloss balm. Therefore, I give it three stars.",Revisor,4 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
my go to lip product!,"This lip balm is literally the only thing I use now, love how the formula is not sticky but super hydrating and soft. The colour is also so gorgeous!",Priyaaa5,1 Jun 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

My all-time favourite gloss that FEELS like a balm,"Incredible gloss. Shiny, lustrous, the PERFECT amount of colour tint and FEELS like a balm. So comfortable and hydrating. The packaging is gorgeous, too. And I love that it doesn't roll off my shelves or desk! Thoughtful packaging from Selena as usual, and fantastic gloss.",Jgoz,28 May 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Worth it!,"So worth the money, if you‚Äôre debating - get it!! This shade is more of a dark nude on me but I just purchased the shade apricot to try a more pinky shade! The only downside of this gloss is that the color does not last long and needs to be reapplied often. Other than that, the gloss is buttery yet not sticky, and looks gorgeous. I wore it to my college graduation and I loved it!",bellaboobb,28 May 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
OMG LOVE,"Ok, but why aren't more people talking about this?!! I got this as a sample with my sephora purchase. Feels soooooo nice on your lips and gives just the perfect amount of color!! Definitely going to purchase the full size!!",TyraKnerr,27 May 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Finally a lip gloss I love, better than lip chap","I highly dislike lip products, either the color, texture or taste are terrible. This is the first one where the color is perfect and neutral, it feels amazing, my lips look way better and moisturized after wearing it, there is no taste or smell, and I can't leave the house without it now. Buildable, but it will get a tiny bit sticky if you lay it on thick. This has replaced my lip chap! Great neutral colour for lighter skin, finally. Not orange or pink",RachelleyBoo,25 May 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Literally the only lip product I‚Äôve completely used up, ever. Moisturizes my lips so well while also providing shine and a wash of colour. One of my holy grail products.",mjischsm,22 May 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,"new favourite lip product, will be collecting all colours! gives lips a nice, sheer colour while being moisturizing",sarah12hayley,16 May 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I had strong hopes in this lip gloss since I already use Selena's products like her concealer, blush, setting spray, etc. I applied this lip gloss and in the beginning, it had a beautiful color and it did not have a gummy texture at all. I do believe that the gummy texture that comes from lip gloss depends on how much you apply though. Anyways, the color did fade after probably a few hours so I did have to reapply, but after a few days of using this lip gloss, I saw that my lips were getting extremely chapped and I never understood why. I later realized that this lip gloss was the heart of that problem; it did lots of damage to the outer-layer of my lips. This disappointed me, but the tints on these lip glosses are perfect; not too much not too little. I would not recommend this for daily use as it might also damage your lips, but a few times a week would be good too if you want to avoid damage.",paulagjoka,16 May 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"LOVE THIS. its very hydrating on my dry lips, and it is a gorgeous color. the only downfall is it doesnt last a really long time, maybe 30 minutes max, but its very pleasing to reapply so im not complaining",emmaaa11,8 May 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

soooo comfortable,i‚Äôve recently been obsessed with glosses and i was recommended this by so many people! the formula is insane and it feels so comfortable on the lips; i‚Äôve never had a lip gloss feel this way! i hope they create more shades.,nidhisinghs,30 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
so gorgeous i bought every color,i absolutely LOVE this gloss. nearly neutral is the prettiest mlbb color. i would definitely repurchase this when i use it all up. it‚Äôs become my fave gloss ever. definitely not long lasting but that should be obvious considering it‚Äôs a gloss.,foreveryoko,29 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
SO GOOD,literally the best lip gloss ever. it is so light on the lips and the color is so pretty good for everyday look to just add some color to the lips. it feels so smooth it really is the best combo of a lip gloss and lip balm. i will definitely continue to buy these and in the different shades. i wish she‚Äôd come out with more,Lisamarie101,29 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Yasssss!,Love love these glosses! They are smooth and the color is beautiful!! Will definitely buy again!,pujbeta,29 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Unbelievably comfortable on the lips,"Have this color and Nearly Neutral. My favorite lip glosses! SO comfortable on the lips. Not too sticky or drying. It‚Äôs a pleasure to reapply. Bobbi Brown Crushed Oil-Infused Gloss is my second favorite, but this takes the cake.",betsy1211,28 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

wow finally a good lip balm,Great lip balm. Stays on and feels moisturizing too. Such a natural and plump look.,munchkin2007,24 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I‚Äôve been trying glossy balms lately and this is a very unique one. I love how this is for those who are looking for more balm feel, I can feel a slight soft waxy coverage to help it stay on longer vs others that have an oily feel to it. It still has a glossy component to it but adds that extra lip balm feel too. For extra dry lips I‚Äôd prefer using this vs other gloss balms simply because I can feel that it‚Äôs more waxy (not in a bad way) and provides the extra moisturizer you may need.",SunnyCaliGirl,23 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Slightly tinted petroleum jelly‚Ä¶.Yuck,I was so disappointed when I tried this product. It doesn‚Äôt look anything like the pictures. I‚Äôm not sure if the formula has been changed but there‚Äôs almost no pigment in it and It is no better than a very cheap lip gloss. I truly cannot understand the good reviews. I am going to see if Sapora will refund. It goes on very sheer and very goopy with absolutely no tint.,cc11185,23 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
shiny plump looking lips,Feels good on lips. Beautiful nude color. Makes my lips look full.,maria09,22 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Chefs Kiss!,"Looks like a lip oil & a lip balm had a baby! Perfection. Beautiful everyday girly, girl shade. Love how soft it feels on my lips. It feels like I‚Äôm wearing my tatcha lip mask all day. It is not sticky either, which is a bonus! Beautiful everyday balm.",GabGab19,22 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
AMAZING,"Best lip gloss I have ever used! Provides a way more universal your lips but better shade than the Fenty which was thick and sticky compared to this. Need to reapply because it is a lip gloss, but the shade is amazing and evened out my lips.",MakeupLover0706,22 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Will Buy Again and Again,"I will keep buying this as long as it's made. I have a fair complexion, dark brown hair, cool undertones, and the Nearly Berry shade gives perfect MLBB vibes in a gloss form. Like, PERFECT shade (for me). I am a natural/matte lip kind of gal usually and get easily annoyed by gloopy glosses or too much shine -- this gloss is NOT gloopy, and the shine is sort of natural looking instead of high gloss. It is smooth, soft, and pleasant to apply. I won't go as far as to say ""not sticky"" because I have yet to experience such a thing and don't think that really exists in a gloss. On days when I need to take a break from my usual matte lip color and need more moisture or a glossier look, I LOVE this comfy, smooth gloss. I lost the first one I owned and was genuinely sad without it, so I repurchased!",shanzig,18 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
AHH-MAZING,"BUY THIS!! I didn‚Äôt think I was crazy about this at first, but now I can‚Äôt stop wearing this every single day! It is so comfortable and the shade is so perfect for every day wear.",abb14,16 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Underrated,"This is the most comfortable ‚Äúgloss‚Äù ever. It truly feels like a lip balm and gives a nice subtle shine. The colour is perfect for a ‚Äúyour lips but better‚Äù shade on me. I love this and will be my go-to, taken everywhere with me kinda lip product. If you‚Äôre on the fence and like tinted lip balms with a bit more shine to it, buy this. No obvious, overbearing fragrance and doesn‚Äôt smell chemically either. Just beware, the staying power is exactly what youd expect from a tinted balm, so nothing crazy there.",Beckaww,12 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
what I‚Äôve been searching for,"This might be my new favorite product. It is the perfect shade to give you color but not make you look like you‚Äôre wearing lipstick.

best lipgloss out there,I am obsessed with this lip glosses. they make your lips feel so smooth and give them a nice colour. 100% worth your money and I can‚Äôt stop recommending this to my friends since it‚Äôs so good,lbw2012,12 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love it,ABSOLUTELY love this! It‚Äôs my new go to lip gloss. It‚Äôs definitely a ‚Äúmy lips but better‚Äù type. Color is amazing. Lasts a good amount of time. I tend to rub my lips together and even doing that doesn‚Äôt make it go away any faster. Not sticky all. Lightweight.  An wear on its own or with a lil lip liner and you‚Äôre good to go,Shyrie94,11 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I have naturally pale lips, and I love how this product is a pop of colour, but still looks natural and effortless. Will recommend highly.",jcll,11 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Very comfortable and not sticky. Very light color. I would buy in again,akunze3,8 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Exactly What I was Looking For,"This is the PERFECT color coverage. Like the photos, it‚Äôs enough so that it adds a natural ‚Äúlike your lips but better‚Äù color to your lips. All I normally use is Glossier‚Äôs Lip balm or Vaseline because I have extremely dry lips. I was looking for something that was kind of like that but not so sticky like a lip gloss- something I could wear everyday in place of Vaseline or my Glossier lip balm when I wanted more color. This is perfect for that. It is extremely natural. The consistency is tackier than Vaseline, but not as sticky as a lip gloss, like Fenty‚Äôs. The best thing about the product is the perfect coverage of natural color.",mindievo,8 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
EVERYONE NEEDS THIS FOR THEIR EVERY DAY LIP,"So far none of Selena Gomez products disappoints! I loooove her packaging- the flat edge on one side so it doesn‚Äôt roll around is genius! As for the actual product itself‚Ä¶ wow!! It‚Äôs such a beautiful color. Don‚Äôt let the outside color convince you that it‚Äôs dark- it‚Äôs not!! It‚Äôs just a tad bit darker than my natural lip color and it feels so hydrating and wonderful! It‚Äôs not sticky at all.
Very creamy and perfect amount of shine. My new favorite favorite lip product!!!",dreamingofpeaks,7 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best Lip Gloss Ever!!!,"I am not a lipgloss kind of girl... Rare Beauty has turned me into a lipgloss girl.This gloss/balm is so moisturising, it feels pillowy on the lips and while it doesn't stay all day (no lipgloss does) it's a joy to reapply. It will not dry out your lips, I swear. My lips are always dry. I don't even need lip balm underneath! Will repurchase over and over. The colour payoff is sheer but noticeable.",ValeCristina,7 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
LIKE BUTTER,"It‚Äôs not exactly the most reflective high shine gloss but more of a moisturizing balm hence the name. It‚Äôs not sticky at all and feels very comfortable on the lips. I also appreciate that there is no crazy fragrance in here. Overall a very approachable, everyday product for the lips",RebeccaJR,7 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Lives up to all the hype,"A true gloss and balm 2-in-1! I have nothing else like this in my collection and it's one of my faves. I'm so happy I bought this, even at full price",maclinds,6 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Nope,"this is a very thick gloss formula that feels goopy on the lips, although it's not sticky it's also not very shiny or glossy and when you rub your lips together the formula forms these stringy gloss bits",Tjjjjjjj,5 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This product is as described - a glossy lip balm. It‚Äôs moisturizing like a balm, glossy like a lip balm but not at all sticky. The color doesn‚Äôt last that long which is ok since my lips still moisturized and it layers very well.",rachdex,4 Apr 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,It was so smooth and moisturizing!! Definitely recommend,Nelle3012,31 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Absolutely love this!!! The perfect neutral colour and the formula is so hydrating. It‚Äôs the slightest bit sticky but not nearly as bad as most lipglosses I‚Äôve used. I found it‚Äôs pretty long lasting too.,maryamsyedd,31 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nearly Apricot - Rare Beauty,Not sure I like the color (Nearly Apricot) enough to keep.,pvmchadwick,25 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

favourite lip gloss,"I love this lip gloss! it's smooth and comfortable to wear, and it gives a beautiful shine and a subtle colour. I'm fair skinned and find even the darkest colour to be subtle on me.",ChelsAnderson,23 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Color is precise and what I was looking for in a clean neutral look. I wish I had bought another to go with the pair.,flyawayhome,20 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
My everyday lip color,"I never do reviews but this is my third time picking this up (and I never thought i would say that for a lip product) . This is the most comfortable lip gloss balm I ever tried. It‚Äôs not too pigmented, not to sheer. And if you want more color, You can pair it with a nude liner. 
It‚Äôs the perfect ‚Äúmy lips but better‚Äù with shine. The formula of this is a perfect consistency of not being to thick or too thin. Just enough hydration and it smooths out the lips beautifully! I use this almost every single day I can‚Äôt not recommend this product enough",brittcolette,17 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Don‚Äôt sleep on these,Really really beautiful formula. feels like a balm and has a super cushiony feel. Perfect for a person on the go without any fuss. This will be in my daily rotation from now on! don‚Äôt sleep on these.,ParisCat19,16 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
NOT a lip balm,"I was excited about this. I am an avid lip balm user, multiple times a day type of thing. I am always looking for alternative that help give a nice tint to my lips. 
And although this is a lovely product, it is NOT a lip balm. It's a nice quality lip gloss that is not overly sticky. But it is still a lip gloss. 
Do not be fooled. I don't know why, after 34 years on earth, I thought that this product would be IT, but no, it's just a nice lip gloss ;)",annemariepapi,16 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Formula is really nice and doesn't seem to be drying, but I've yet to wear it all day long. I'm looking forward to see how it does wear. I feel like a little goes a long way and applying too much can make it feel too thick (but not sticky). This shade is a little more on the brown side..was hoping for a more pink-ish nude. I'm hoping it will layer well with charlotte tilbury's pillow talk!",mcmoreal,15 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
10/10 Best Nude Gloss!,I intended on buying the makeup by Mario lip plumping serum in the shade Mauve but they were sold out. So instead I got this balm as it was the same shade. I was surprisingly impressed! Feels soft on the lips and when it starts to fade it doesn‚Äôt feel like my lips are flaky or dry (which I usually get after glosses). It‚Äôs hydrating with the slightest bit of color & a subtle gloss. 10/10!,stephanieash,15 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
beautiful!,"Beautiful!! Love it so much. Bought this after seeing it on tiktok and it‚Äôs my favorite ‚Äúyour lips but better‚Äù type of gloss. So soft and natural looking, I want all of the colors lol.",dcasta,15 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love!,This is a beautiful nice gloss. It‚Äôs actually pigmented and to match it I also bought the liquid eyeshadow with it! It‚Äôs beautiful together!,MelanieOrtiz32,15 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

beautiful colour,"Absolutely love this product! Such a nice neutral colour for medium to lighter skin tones. What I like the most is how soft and moisturizing this product feels on the lips, definitely not sticky and gives a beautiful natural look to the lips.",YourCutieAmanda,14 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
like butter with a tint,"Don‚Äôt get how people are saying it‚Äôs just a lipgloss, no it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs better then any lipgloss I‚Äôve ever tried, better then the Dior ones. This has such a beautiful pigment, glides on so smoothly and does not get sticky or tacky no matter how many layers you add so you can safely deepen the color without worrying about a sticky mess. Is definitely worth the price. I can‚Äôt explain how smooth and soft it feels, it feels like a super smooth lip balm but only it‚Äôs lipgloss. Someone said it didn‚Äôt fit their lips, as they have darker lips but I think it also depends on the color you purchase. I have a darker tint to my lips and this color popped so well. definitely recommend this lipgloss.",etufino,11 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I‚Äôve been looking for a hydrating gloss to replace one I‚Äôve been using from an MLM and this one is amazing! It feels great on and it‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for, for a much better price. I find the nearly rose shade a bit too pink for me, but I‚Äôll continue to use it and I‚Äôve already ordered the nearly neutral shade. Every time I try a Rare Beauty product, I end up adding it to my regular rotation! I love the line!",missyfitz,11 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,i can never be disappointed with the rare beauty line! this gloss has such a nice formula it‚Äôs not sticky and actually feels a little hydrating?? though not super long lasting and the color isn‚Äôt that visible with my hyper pigmented lips I still love this product in combination with others,ridak26,10 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
your lips but better gloss,"I fell in love with this gloss instantly. I love the look of gloss but I've never liked the feel of it on my lips and I always felt like it made my lips look weird cuz they're a little smaller. I've tried so many coloured and clear lip glosses and this one is perfect. Its not sticky at all and its very lightweight. It also moisturizes my lips at the same time! It suits my lips perfectly and the colour is the perfect ""your lips but better"". I have pinkier lips so it perfectly and subtly amplifies  my colour so naturally. I'm looking to get the Nearly Mauve colour next.",ricogal10,9 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
the best,The best lip gloss ever and stays on the lips for a long time,abbysomoza,7 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
does nothing,"I was very disappointed in this product, especially since it has 5 stars and raving reviews. The formula is okay, it‚Äôs decently moisturizing and light on the lips. But I found it almost too light on the lips? It felt like it did nothing, and wasn‚Äôt really glossy at all. It also faded away super quickly. I got the color nearly neutral which I thought would be a bit peachier but it‚Äôs actually more of a brownish shade.",EmmaT11,6 Mar 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Best best best,"Best lipgloss I have ever had and I own plenty! From fenty b to huda, they come last compared to this beauty.

,"love this! my new favourite go too lipgloss! gorgeous colour, would buy it again!!",lbw2012,28 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best gloss I‚Äôve tried so far!,"This is probably the best feeling lip gloss I‚Äôve ever tried! Provided it isn‚Äôt technically a lip gloss but a liquid lip balm, it gives basically the same effect. I got it as a sample first and then bought the full size. I got mine in the shade Nearly Neutral which is a really flattering sheer-ish rosy brown. It has no glitter to it and a nice almost-milky feel/look which I appreciate. It is moisturising but not enough for my dry dehydrated lips. I do still wear it to sleep at night tho. Definitely going to buy in more colours!",MinahilKhan,27 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Wasn't sold at first but...,The color isn't doing it for me.. super subtly basically has zero color. HOWEVER... shine is on point and hydration is on point. My lips are so chapped and cracked year round and this definitely makes an immediate difference.,Tawnsx3,27 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,i love this product and use it every day. selena really knows what she‚Äôs doing!,ellewinslow,26 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Holy grail!! Gorgeous color,"I have found my holy grail lip gloss/balm. I have been using this lip product since rare beauty launched and let me tell you the formula is a dream! Super comfortable, buttery and  it‚Äôs not sticky at all. Has a slight vanilla scent (to me) but nothing overpowering.",jenxlc,26 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I have always struggled with finding lip color that doesn‚Äôt settle into fine lines and dryness on my lips. It seems like no matter how well I take care of them, all products with any color look disgusting on my lips. Enter the Stay Vulnerable Glossy Lip Balm. This product has the perfect amount of color for me (prefer a natural look) and it does not settle into fine lines or dryness. It is thick, but not sticky or stringy. It is hydrating but doesn‚Äôt feel too slippy. It is NOT transfer proof but I don‚Äôt think it claims to be and I didn‚Äôt expect it to be. I reapply often through the day but I honestly don‚Äôt mind- I love the product so much I enjoy reapplying! I also have this in shades Nearly Apricot and Nearly Rose and eventually I will have all of the shades and I hope she releases more!",KSE0410,25 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Worth the hype,"This balm is actually moisturizing (during the winter). No noticeable scent & feels great on the lips... Subtle, natural looking color, not overly glossy or sticky‚Äîzero cons!",Taren224,22 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nice consistency,"very natural looking  , doesn‚Äôt have any smell tho",ZorimarO,22 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Instant favorite. One of the most comfortable gloss I've used and the color is stunning.,anddyy,20 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
soft mauve,"I love this lip gloss. It‚Äôs so moisturizing and NOT sticky. The mauve color is mostly a sheer true mauve and the formula feels nice and light on my lips. It stays shiny and nourishing on my lips for quite awhile. There is no cooling/tingly sensation, which I strongly dislike in any lip products.",alafair,20 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
OBBSESSED,I randomly saw these in the store and bought two colors. Really love them. The gloss has great staying power and isn't too sticky 10/10,jenocbr,13 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
new fav!,"I LOVE this gloss, very natural looking color, not very bold & doesn‚Äôt have that thick sticky feeling. Highly recommend :)",jjaassmmiinn,9 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Favorite Gloss!,"I thought this was just gonna be average like any other gloss I have (I wear glosses every day for hydration) but oh my gosh, this is amazing!!! It lives up to the name of a balm instead of a regular gloss. I‚Äôll even wear this without any makeup because the apricot shade is basically my lip color but better! Amazing product! Love the packaging too so it doesn‚Äôt roll around everywhere. Selena really did that",MackieB,7 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
you won‚Äôt regret it!,"Literally obsessed with these lipglosses, I have 3 out of 5 shades and can‚Äôt wait to get the other two! They are so soft and hydrating, can‚Äôt replace them!",kris599,6 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
i‚Äôm OBSESSED!!!,"this is my new favorite lip product!
i‚Äôm very pale and hesitant to using any colored lip products (i usually wear clear or slightly tinted glosses/lip oils since my lips have barely any color to them) but i ordered the shade ‚Äúnearly neutral‚Äù and it is PERFECT, even on my pale lips. this gloss has the texture and hydration of a lip balm, and shines like a gloss, but it does not slip around or feel sticky like most glosses do. 
i always have had to layer a lip balm underneath any lip product i use because my lips tend to dry out and become cracked with nearly every lip product (even lip oils!), and this is the only gloss i do not have to do that with. 
definitely worth the price!",laurameche,4 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I was curious about this product so I bought it the other day and it‚Äôs not sticky, pretty slick and I guess more of a silicone type of feel but it‚Äôs weightless and a beautiful shade it almost matches my natural lip color. I‚Äôve tried other rare beauty products and ended up loving them so this is just worth the hype!",naomingu,3 Feb 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Lucious and hydrating! This is definitely worth the money. The color is pretty pigmented and gives the lips a healthy glow.,magc623,31 Jan 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I am very particular when picking lip products because of the smell and consistency. This product is perfect! No smell, and not sticky!!!!! Beautiful color!!",rache1p,28 Jan 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Feels so good,"I love this. I accidentally got the shade nearly neutral when I meant to get nearly rose but I ended up really liking it! It smells good, feels SO good on the lips. Not sticky at all, it‚Äôs moisturizing and I can‚Äôt stop smacking my lips together when I wear this. You‚Äôd think by how it looks in the tube it would be too dark but it wasn‚Äôt, it looked great with my skin tone. The shine/gloss of it doesn‚Äôt last too long though.",CourageBaby,22 Jan 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
LOVE!,"This is a REAL review from someone who thought she had tried every lip gloss out there and just hated them all.. until NOW!! This formula gloss is so nice on the lips, I've always hated the texture and feel of gloss on my mouth but this stuff hits different! So comfortable and long lasting without making my lips/mouth feel yucky!",katieJ45,20 Jan 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

you need to buy this,"I rarely write reviews, which I need to be better about, because this lippie is GREAT. I‚Äôm very minimal when it comes to makeup simply because I‚Äôm lazy. This came in last night, so I was able to try this morning before work and let me tell you- I will now be buying every shade. It‚Äôs so smooth and velvety, NOT sticky like a normal gloss!! My mind was blown when I put it on. It‚Äôs so comfortable and I‚Äôm not worried about it coming off while I eating or anything, I‚Äôm just glad it won‚Äôt dry my lips out. So comfortable to wear, definitely recommend",kris599,11 Jan 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
The PERFECT lip gloss,"Probably the best lip gloss that I've tried so far! I'm not one to wear lip gloss, however, this product doesn't feel sticky at all and is very moisturizing. It's also light weight so it feels like you're not even wearing anything on your lips.",hannah194,9 Jan 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
sheer color and moisturizing,"Looks like a gloss, moisturizes like a balm. Not as pigmented as I expected but I‚Äôm happy with that - it stays on for a long time and is perfect for daytime meetings. Nearly mauve is a gorgeous color. Love the packaging too, how it lays flat. I will definitely be trying more colors.",luluhibou,6 Jan 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Sheer but doesn't disappear right away.,I just bought Nearly Berry yesterday and I already want to go back to Sephora and get more colors! I love sheer lip gloss but it usually has no staying power. This one actually does.,JLeigh718,5 Jan 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

so moisturizing! i love it!,"i literally LOVE this. i‚Äôve had this for about 3 months now and still use it pretty much every day. it‚Äôs moisturizing and not sticky at all. my favorite thing about this product is its applicator. it feels so good on my lips (if that makes sense) and blends so well. i got this from the limited edition nearly mauves set, but plan on repurchasing a full size soon!!",lipglossesyuh,2 Jan 2022,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,love this shade. I like that this formula isn't super sticky.,marsbats,30 Dec 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
best gloss,I didn‚Äôt think a lip gloss could be THAT different from others. I was wrong. This supercedes every gloss in my drawer. By a lot. Just try it. You‚Äôll throw away the others you have.,hackattack,29 Dec 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,super hydrating and feels just like lip balm. i thought the shade would be more pink but it looks very natural and could easily be worn with anything,revelvle,29 Dec 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Awesome Lip Balm!,"Love this glossy lip balm! it's light and not too sloppy/liquidy, and I love the added color. looks great by itself, or add it over a lighter color to give some shimmer. Pricey but worth it.",CameronGR,22 Dec 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"don't think too much, buy it","this lip gloss/balm is it. if you're deciding whether or not you want it, consider this a sign to pull the trigger. i never write reviews but for this product, i will. the brown-pink color is very flattering for my tan skin. the product is moisturizing and provides a beautiful shine that lasts longer than any gloss I've tried. after you wipe off the product it doesn't leave your lips feeling dry or chapped. i wish they had more colors because i would buy them all.",carogar2,20 Dec 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,So glad that I gave this a try! I initially purchased the Mini Mauves set. I liked it so much that I  ordered the gloss in two more colors. I cannot wear super sticky glosses. It drives me crazy! This Glossy Lip Balm looks great and feels very comfortable on your lips. I will get lots of use out of the three shades I have purchased now. They look nice on their own and even better layered over a liner or lipstick. I hope additional shade are added to the line. I would definitely buy more!,LenniM,18 Dec 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Perfect in every way!,"Oh man‚Ä¶ I was looking for a gloss that would have subtle shimmer and hydrate my lips instead of just making them sticky and this is PERFECT.

Now I want the whole line‚Ä¶ This may very well become my favourite ever!",AramisMelodie,16 Dec 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
AMAZING,makes my lips feel super hydrated and the color is super natural and pretty,laureng077,14 Dec 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This is my favorite lip makeup product I‚Äôve ever tried. I‚Äôm a person that is addicted to chapstick and can‚Äôt have dry lips. I don‚Äôt really like the feeling of lipstick or gloss on my lips but this is just amazing. It has the softest, most hydrating consistency. It‚Äôs really unique. I wear it on no makeup days or makeup days. It just makes your lips look their absolute best. I have shade nearly neutral and it is the perfect your lips but better shade. I wish I could thank Selena personally for creating this product!! I will never be without it.",desbeautyqueen,4 Dec 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
My faves!!,"I absolutely love these glosses! I have them in Nearly Neutral, Apricote and Mauve and I love all of them! Beautiful shades, feel like silk on your lips and they give you gorgeous plump and juicy lips. They don't dry my lips out and my lips get very easily dried out and the gloss has a decent staying power for a lip gloss, enough for me to want all the shades and I use them every day! An absolute hit from Selena!",ALM1989,3 Dec 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Honestly I'm in love with this gloss! It's not sticky. The smell is not strong nor bad. I'm surprised how hydrating it is. It's a great gloss for day to day activities. I'm looking forward to getting the other shades in the future! I 100% recommend this lip gloss!!!,FaraTurtle,28 Nov 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best lip balm ever!!,"I am someone that struggles to keep her lips hydrated and moisturized. I have bought a lot of lip balms/lip masks but all of them leave my lips feeling drier than before applying the product. This lip balm is the only one that I have found that leaves my lips soft and hydrated hours after applying the product. I started with Nearly Mauve, which is the perfect YLBB color btw, and so far I have bought 2 more shades. Eyeing the rest because I dont want to ever run our of this. 

If you are like me that struggles with very dry lips trust me you should give this product a try. It‚Äôs the best.",zayragiselle,14 Nov 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Perfect!,This color matched the color of my lips so well. I was shocked. It is so pretty!! The balm feels really good on the lips and moisturizing does leave a slightly glossy look to it. It lasted a good bit as well.,reve3,13 Nov 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Definitely glossy,"It‚Äôs definitely hydrating and glossy but honestly I‚Äôd consider it more of a lip gloss. The colour is really faint but I guess there‚Äôs sort of a tint and it is a bit stinky. Overall if ur going for more of a lip glossy-type lip balm, I‚Äôd go for it",noplaid,12 Nov 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Beautiful colour, with or without a lip liner. Definitely recommend for those of you who like to keep their make up simple and minimal.",monique14,12 Nov 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

AMAZING,"AMAZING!!! Love every color, feels amazing on my lips, doesn‚Äôt smell like anything which is great for me because I hate lip products with an overpowering scent. Overall, it feels like a lip mask and the color payoff is so great and looks very natural.",makeupguru1204,1 Nov 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
The best lip balm I've tried!,I can't rave enough about this product! It feels so nice on the lips and not sticky at all! It gives the lips such a nice tint of color and gives such a pretty glossy finish. I can't recommend this product enough and will definitely be repurchasing as soon as I run out!,splt,25 Oct 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I got a free sample of Soft neutral pink and immediately ordered the full tube. It is so subtle but you can tell you‚Äôve got something on. I love it!,jaymie1982,25 Oct 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,"I own the Nearly Rose and Nearly Mauve colors, and they're both beautiful on their own and over other lipsticks. These are my absolute favorite glosses! Moisturizing with none of that stringy glossy stuff that happens with other glosses.",ThatDancerChick,15 Oct 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Beautiful color, hydrating",It is gorgeous. Very hydrating and I get compliments on this gloss. The formula is great.,JayJayManD77199,11 Oct 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Super Natural,"I didn‚Äôt know what to expect at first with this balm, I just really liked the color of the nearly apricot cream blush so I figured I‚Äôd pair it with this. I really like the subtlety of this balm, it‚Äôs not super pigmented so it really does give a nice natural color to the lips. I also love the texture of this too, it‚Äôs not too thick and doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or tacky at all. My lips definitely feel soft whenever I use this. The only thing that‚Äôs kind of a bummer is that it literally only lasts like 15 min but that‚Äôs like with almost any lip gloss/balm so it is what it is I guess. Overall, I think any of these colors would be a good choice for someone who wants a little bit of color while still giving your lips some hydration.",xolaurenxo94,8 Oct 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
The perfect lipgloss,"I never leave reviews but this is the best lipgloss ever!!! The shade nearly neutral is beautiful - just enough pigment for an everyday gloss. I usually don‚Äôt like wearing lipgloss because I don‚Äôt like the way it feels on my lips (my lips are chronically chapped). However, this gloss is so moisturizing and really does feel like a lip balm!!",biancaa20,5 Oct 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
10/10,Listen.. I don‚Äôt write reviews often.. but this gloss deserves it. I am obsessed. I truly never thought I would like a gloss so much but this has become a staple for me. It‚Äôs such a beautiful glass with just enough pigment. It leaves your lips feeling so hydrated and even makes them look a little more plump. This formula is not sticky at all and feels so comfortable on the lips. Worth every penny.,Daniellecv,4 Oct 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Basic natural glass,Very natural light weight color and feel. I applied it and 10min later it disappeared off my lips! So you might have to reapply it often. I like the pinkish/rosy color. It‚Äôs just a good everyday simple hint of color gloss.,xoariannaxo,4 Sep 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Feels very nice on the lips. It hydrates and makes my lips look a little more plump. I also love how there just a pop of natural  color.,Ariastar,3 Sep 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

MUST HAVE,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL AND MOISTURIZING! I got another one also in a different color. Such a good everyday lip color especially for medium to dark skin tones! A must have,Katiemoseng,31 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
GIRL. YES.,"These are AMAZING. They don‚Äôt even feel like a gloss, they feel like a buttery chapstick. The formulation reminds me of the Vaseline lip therapy (which is one of my favorites). I can‚Äôt recommend these enough. Keep in mind that they are advertised as glossy lip balms, so don‚Äôt except a pigmented gloss. These are amazing for every day wear to give your lips a little something. LOVE. I‚Äôll be purchasing in every color lol",vanesenia,31 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Lightweight and moisturizing,"This is a really nice product that's easy to swipe on and go. This gives a nice bit of hydration and a very sheer tint, so don't expect too much colour payoff. I really like that this feels so light on my lips. This will not last through any meals but that's expected, but the moisture is still there even when the colour fades",fireflyxxi,29 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Loooooove!!,"This glossy balm is EVERYTHING!! I‚Äôve bought 3 in 3 different shades so far. It‚Äôs creamy, not sticky, nourishing, and the slightest hint of color. It‚Äôs a staple now!",BreezyLM,24 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Wears like a dream!,"Rare Beauty has basically become my entire face routine! But this gloss in particular is SO beautiful, lightweight, and pretty pigmented (or at least you can built it as much as you wish). It also smells like a scented marker I would use as a child that I loved lol. I wear this by itself and find it good on its own with nothing underneath.",emcookxo,20 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Good, nothing amazing","It‚Äôs okay nothing amazing but it‚Äôs not bad. On the lips it feels smooth, not too thick or too thin. It has more of a neutral smell and there‚Äôs no taste to it. I do wish it came with more product in it seeing as the packaging kind of fools you into thinking there‚Äôs more than there actually is. The color is nice though, it‚Äôs very subtle and sheer and it‚Äôs easy to apply with the soft applicator",alexlea3,16 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
not the same shade?,I had gotten the mini one and I loved it so much that I got the large size and it‚Äôs definitely different I don‚Äôt hate it though it‚Äôs a good basic,veroviper,10 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Unlike any other gloss/balm I own,"This is my top favorite gloss/balm and I am a gloss/balm snob.  The texture is unlike anything else I own.  It‚Äôs not sticky at all but also feels substantial.  It almost feels like it really sinks into the lips.  It smooths my lip lines and lasts a long time.  As it wears off, my lips stay hydrated.  I own 4 shades and my favorite is nearly apricot.  It‚Äôs also the most sheer shade which I prefer.  I will always have this product on hand from now on.",Jesslynnk,8 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Just ok.,"Meh, not amazing but not bag. Basic gloss. I won't purchase other colors.",roselizz123,6 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Yes!!!,Love it so much gives a nice soft touch of color. Looks great with my brown hair and eyes,steph202039,2 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love this product,This is such a beautiful lip gloss/balm. The nearly Apricot was the 1st one I brought loved it so much went to my local Sephora & brought another one today. Now I have the Nearly Mauve color I loved the color even more than the 1st one I brought I just now went online to buy the remaining colors. I just hope she doesn‚Äôt come out with more colors because I would have to buy them all lol. As a lot of reviews on here said it fades so nicely when the gross is gone you can still feel it on your lips & it also still there almost like a lip stain also I wasn‚Äôt going to try any of her products again because the 1st one I bought was the dewy lip balm I liked the formula but it didn‚Äôt last on my lips very long it was gone in like 5 minutes this one is like night & day between the two. Thank you Selena for such a wonderful product & the message you have about Rare beauty because we are all beautiful in our own way.,babypebb,1 Aug 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Great lippy! My new favorite!,"This lipgloss is amazing! The older I get the less I like a heavy lip for everyday but I love the hydration of a balm. This hits all the marks for me, if you‚Äôre on the fence, try it! Very, very subtle color, which I love but do be aware!",tracyd007,23 Jul 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Just do it. <3,Love this gloss. Great color and coverage... AND I never write reviews lol but it's great.,RachelAlby,22 Jul 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Lipgloss aficionada,"What a lovely feel this lipgloss has! Not sticky, but still tenacious and moisturizing.
Nearly Rose is a light cool rose color that helps the color of my lips look more healthy (which are naturally dark).
I was using Buxom, which is a nice gloss, but it seems to dry my lips (the menthol) and I have to reapply it too often. Rare Beauty hits all the marks for staying power, comfort and nice color. Will repurchase",badstuff,21 Jul 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
My favorite,I love this so much. The color is so subtle that it doesn‚Äôt rub off super easy which is always my concern with gloss. It also sets really well on your lips and doesn‚Äôt slide around. It definitely does feel more like a balm than a ‚Äúlipstick‚Äù which adds points for me because I‚Äôm not really a fan of lip products usually. I wish I had the money to buy more than one color.,gggghik,16 Jul 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
great gloss!,"LOVE. This is a great gloss. It is not sticky, natural looking, and pretty hydrating. I would recommend.",CaiHan,15 Jul 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
OH MY...,"So I got the Nearly Berry and the Nearly Rose. Because testing is a no go at my local store, though I'm sure at many stores still, I got both colors because I was unsure which one I would like better. Or even if I was going to like the formula at all. But OH MY GOSH! I can not stress enough how amazing this lip gloss is. I have one Fenty gloss from a friend, and i thought i loved it. plus that tube has more product, but this totally blows it out of the water. Light scent. pop of color; just as advertised. Not sticky. Feels this awesome mix between an oil and a jelly and I will not be returning either. I love both colors too the ends of the earth and am trying to stop myself from buying the remaining colors. I'm probably going to fail.",emmykate43,9 Jul 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Honestly OBSESSED with these!! I love them so much, they‚Äôre like the perfect gloss but also a lip balm. The shape of the applicator is perfect and the texture as well. I love everything about this product, it‚Äôs super moisturising and gives you a great pout. I got one for free and literally went to buy another because I‚Äôm obsessed. The only reason I took away a star is because it has virtually no tint in my opinion. It‚Äôs the only thing I was disappointed about. They sell them in all these great colours but it comes out clear on the lips (well mine at least) so it‚Äôs pretty pointless to pick a colour if it‚Äôs not gonna show. Both colours I have that are very different come out very similar, if not the same so just a thing to keep in mind but other than that I love!",Vee2819,6 Jul 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Beautiful!,"I love this lip product! It's the perfect in-between of a gloss and a lip balm. It lasts a decent amount of time on the lips, it's minimally sticky, and it adds just enough colour to the lips where you can wear it on top of another product or alone! This has been my go to lip product so far this summer.",ChrisDisco,4 Jul 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love,Loved the color and the balm feel of this! Plan to order more colors!,Rach2016,26 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
LOVE THIS Product!,LOVE THIS SO MUCH. It‚Äôs the perfect gloss/balm for those natural days and it‚Äôs not sticky the color is amazing. It‚Äôs worth EVERY penny! The packaging is so cute and cool! I‚Äôm going to buy the nearly apricot color because I love that product.,Briseida17,26 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Love the way this feels on my lips! A gloss that actually feels moisturizing,camidy,25 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
a little sticky,This is a great color. Love the flat side to the tube so it doesn‚Äôt roll off the counter,PAS49,22 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Summer beauty must have,Perfect light pink shade!! Stays on all day and adds the perfect gloss to my lips.,Adelyngirl,22 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
not dry nor heavy. Just perfect,Perfect gloss. From all the products I have ever tried in the lipgloss category this one right here is beyond expectations. It does not leave your lips dry after application even the next morning your lips will be soft. The product is not heavy and it leaves a subtle shine on your lips. Perfect,sarahicon,20 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
love it,This gloss is amazing. You won‚Äôt regret trying it! The nearly neutral color is perfect. I very quickly bought the full size after getting this as a bazaar item.,alexxabrown,20 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Not much Color,"I don't want to say I hate it, but I have natural lip color and I was looking for something with color to make my lips pop yet be subtle.  Unfortunately, this is not the color that did that. I'm going to have to put some lipstick then apply this on top which is not what I wanted. It's a shame to because I love coral colors. However I do recommend the products since they don't feel sticky.",Austingurl,15 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Get it!,"If you‚Äôre on the fence about buying this, do yourself a favor and buy it!!! I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd like it bc I already got the fenty gloss - I ended up getting this and actually prefer this one to fenty! It‚Äôs a very cushiony gloss and the color is noticeable. It really can be worn on its own and will definitely be a summer staple for me since the color is gorgeous and the formula is so lightweight! I got it in nearly rose and I have medium tan skin with peach undertones and it looks so good!",giselle15x,14 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Applies like a gloss, behaves like a lip balm. Non sticky, subtle color, and makes my lips feel nourished for hours before having to reapply.",esshhaa,10 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
One Layer Made A Change.,"Exactly As Described. Feels Like Balm And It‚Äôs Glossy. I Dislike Glosses That Feel Extremely Light, Leaving Smudges, And Wears Off Immediately After Use. The ‚Äú Nearly Neutral‚ÄùShade Enhances The Pink Tone To My Lips Even More.",AyeeeeDeeDee99,8 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Why don‚Äôt you recognize I‚Äôm so rare?,I have the nearly mauve as a free product. After I bought the nearly apricot and nearly berry. I‚Äôve tried a lot of gloss because I‚Äôm more a glossy person than matte. I was genuinely impressed by the quality. Not sticky at all. Good hydration too. I know some people complain about not having a lot of pigmentation but it‚Äôs for natural look. Not glam look. I recommend this for everyone! I use it for my everyday look. Rare Beauty did an incredible job about this.,vanmorganxo,5 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
The search is over,"This is such a good gloss. The color is a few shades darker than my natural lip color. I have been searching for a lip gloss that was not sticky and I hit the jackpot with this one. It feels moisturizing and never sticky. It wears off beautifully and never leaves that gross residue that some glosses can do (if you know, you know) I can‚Äôt recommend this enough. I got it as a sample and finished the tube, I HAD to buy the full size. I wear it daily.",JACQUICAR,1 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Received this gloss as a sample. The formula is amazing. It feels like a balm and is suuuuper smooth but it‚Äôs shiny like a gloss. There is also no sticky feeling. The gloss has a subtle vanilla scent, similar to the MAC lipglass scent but lighter. Will definitely purchase the full size.",xvee3,1 Jun 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This is no different than your standard dollar store lip gloss but backed by a major celebrity. That's it. There's nothing special about this to justify the price or hype. 

The color itself is subtle, not very pigmented. Typical shine for a gloss and about average wear time.",mohawkbaby,28 May 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Loved the color on my lips, it‚Äôs such a beautiful color. I bought the neutral one & loved the color, so I decided to buy another color (something different). Do not regret buying the nearly berry one. Great formula and color!!!",sandra559,27 May 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I haven‚Äôt had a bad item with Rare Beauty!! I have loved everything that I have purchased! This is such a neat item, it‚Äôs both glossy & more like a stain at the same time!",jen101,19 May 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Softness and Hydration,I really like this glossy lip balm. It does feel very hydrating and  I like the hint of color it gives my lips.,Ximena30,14 May 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Beautiful lip balm/gloss!! I've been looking for a moisturizing lippie that isn't sticky or too heavy on the lips. I thought this was the perfect amount of pigment and the nearly neutral shade is super cute and natural.,Pompie,9 May 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"I hate gloss, but love this one!","I have a deep disdain for lip gloss. Mostly because the way it makes my lips feel. Not fan of heavy lip products and sticky lips. I LOVE this formula. Bought this color back in January and now have 3 other colors. Looks like a gloss, feels and acts like lip balm. My lips are so soft after wearing this all day with no other treatment.",StephanieDawn,6 May 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Better than a gloss!,"The name is just so accurate. There's no other way to describe it! Applies like a gloss, looks like a gloss, feels like a balm (so smooth!) The already light pigment doesn't last super long but over liner, it would be stunning!",beatricears,6 May 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Not bad for a gloss....if you like gloss......,"Not bad for a lip gloss but nothing to write home about.  I was totally sold on the three step monochromatic makeup look after watching the Selena videos.  After I fell in love with the blush - I just had to buy the eyeshadow and lip gloss to complete the look. I found nothing overly special about it and for the price I figured it would be better spent on something else.  Will return once stores open up again and 
try other parts of her collection...maybe more blush!",apes123,4 May 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
SUPER HYDRATING,"I was not expecting this gloss to be this thick and buttery but it's honestly amazing. It's not one of those watery glosses and wear off after 15 min. The color is super subtle, so it gives you shine but not that much color so if you want color buy a darker color. It's pretty transparent. But overall worth the money.",DenisaMatei,2 May 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"It‚Äôs just a lip gloss! Nothing special. After using it a couple of times, I just didn‚Äôt feel like the price was worth it. Won‚Äôt be buying. Nothing against Selena",JJ1983koh,1 May 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Beautiful color and Application,"WOW JUST WOW. 
It applies easily and is soft on the lips not sticky at all.  The color is beautiful. I have it in both berry and neutral and I am so excited to try the rest of the colors.  The packaging is very solid and heavy",Ninafurtado,29 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Feels Like a Lip Treatment,This stuff is sooo comfortable. I just keep applying it all day because it feels like a lip treatment. Pretty color and just enough shine. I mostly wear it for how it feels. LOVE!,MaggieLawhorn,29 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Buttery balm, not gloss","I really love this product. It‚Äôs such a buttery formula and the colour is really pretty. It‚Äôs called a glossy balm but I don‚Äôt find it has much of a gloss to it, maybe when it‚Äôs first applied but then after a few minutes it‚Äôs not all that shiny. But I kind of like that about it too. I also really love the brush texture lol, it has these really soft bristles? on the applicator... I‚Äôm not really sure what their called. So the only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is because I don‚Äôt really consider it glossy, so that might be a bit misleading to some who think it‚Äôs primarily a lip gloss.",nysk,27 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
amazing,"I love this gloss it‚Äôs so hydrating and smooth. It‚Äôs so very lightly pigmented but brings the lips back to life. So perfect for the spring and summer, definitely going to stay in my purse all summer!",alyssaxnoelle,27 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Nothing to rave about,The shade Nearly Mauve doesn‚Äôt do anything for me. This shade is just like my natural lip color. I find it sticky. It doesn‚Äôt last long. It‚Äôs overpriced. I love Essence $2 lip glosses much more. I will be returning.,MonaYoan,23 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Subtle color and shine,"The color on it‚Äôs own is ok, too similar to my lips and very subtle. I do like it with my lip liner or over some lipstick. Doesnt give much shine compared to Summer Friday‚Äôs Butter Balm (my fav and go to). It feels a little thick.",mtri,22 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

not sticky at all,"As someone who gets an allergic reaction to Shea butter in lip products, it‚Äôs been a struggle to find good lipstick and gloss has been the safe choice for me. I absolutely can‚Äôt do gloss because most of them have a tingly sensation or they‚Äôre sticky. This gloss balm is a truly a LIFESAVER. The moment I put them on my dry lips, it felt like they finally got a sip of water and were plump. Nearly neutral is a ‚Äúmy lips but better‚Äù type of shade. (Including a photo, lips are natural)",emellegien,17 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Love this glossy balm! I usually steer clear of glosses but this formula is more balmy and hydrating with a subtle touch of color. I'm excited to try the other color's!,jammac,16 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,"I LOVE this! Never want to use another gloss. Sheer colour, nice sheen, feels like a lip mask. Not at all sticky. Definitely a sheer wash of colour so if you want something super pigmented this isn‚Äôt really it.

STUNNING,This is the best lip gloss I‚Äôve purchased. It feels like a lip balm but it goes on like a gloss and leaves a very nourished look and the texture on the lips. It‚Äôs not sticky at all and feel so comfortable on the lips. I have very sensitive skin and this is a lip product that doesn‚Äôt leave my lips irritated. Hands-down would buy this product over and over again.,melaniaaa,10 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Do I not understand what ""non-sticky"" means?","I bought this for two reasons: it's supposed to be non-sticky and it's supposed to feel nourishing. Neither of those are true for me. It's just as sticky as most other lip glosses I've tried, only tolerable in a super thin layer, and my lips don't feel more hydrated or moisturized than with other glosses. There are absolutely worse glosses out there, it stays on nicely and the color is lovely and I'm so glad other people enjoy it, but I feel severely misled by the hype. I'm probably just going to pass this along to someone else. The potentially impossible hunt for a non-sticky gloss continues.",BlackbirdRose,9 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This is my new go to every day lip gloss, it makes your lips really soft and the colour is very pretty. It kind of smells like vaseline.",Liv2v8,8 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
At last I found a balmy lip gloss!,I don't like how lip glosses feel on my lips as I find them to be heavy and sticky. But I do love how they look on. I have always been looking for that lip product that looks glossy but feels balmy and moisturizing. This is the one! I love it so much I have ran out of it in 2 months after daily use. Downside is smell. It contains the same fragrance as the other lip products from Rare beauty but I find this one less strong. I would love to see a clear version of it too!,catalana87,7 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,OMG this you guys is the absolute best lip balm I ever tried. It‚Äôs close to the tower 28 one but I find this one last a bit longer on the lips. Wow don‚Äôt hesitate and get it !,Jeanie82,6 Apr 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,"I haven‚Äôt work gloss since I was about 16. I‚Äôve tried the kylie ones and several others and just couldn‚Äôt do it. Due to my skin tone and my lips not being as full as most who wear gloss, it just never seemed to look right on me in my opinion after my teen years...but this stuff is wonderful. It‚Äôs not sticky or goopy, and provides ample coverage to those like myself with thinner lips. The color is versatile as well.",Careuhhhhh,17 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Natural effortless lip color,When you want a natural effortless lip this product is perfect! It brings just enough color to go from a dull to a kissable lip shine. The formula is thick without being sticky and it's moisture rich so it leaves my lips smooth. I can't wait to try other colors.,Shrimpngrits,9 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Luxe Balm,"I am OBSESSED! This is definitely a luxurious and elegant version of Vaseline. Applies like a dream, never goopy or sticky. Best thing is that there is no fragrance, unlike the previous Rare Beauty balms. Such a great wash of colour, definitely not as pigmented as the pictures show. The colour looks nice as a swatch but on my lips it is VERY sheen, but enough colour to look like your lips but better. Doesn't feel like you have anything on your lips at all. Not sure if it is worth it to purchase all the colours since this is similar to the Nearly Neutral shade I received as a sample, but it can't hurt to try out the other shades!",Zay20,9 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"If you‚Äôre thinking about getting it, get it.","100% recommend to everyone who is interested in this product! I purchased nearly mauve and it is such a beautiful color when applied, giving the lips a hydration boost as well. It as a cushiony feel to it, and it not at all sticky rather very comfortable. It‚Äôs such a great formula!!",felicity44,8 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
wanted a little more pigment,feels great when applying and fairly hydrating. however not much colour tint and doesn't last long on. probably won't purchase again.,tmi123,8 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Must Have!,"I love the texture of this so much! It‚Äôs a hybrid between a balm and a gloss just like the name suggests and I don‚Äôt have anything that feels this good in my collection. It‚Äôs great for everyday wear and I appreciate that it‚Äôs not overly shiny. I will definitely be getting more colors the next time I‚Äôm in Sephora, this product feels heavenly on my lips.",thebrittster,7 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
nearly berry review,"So I have all shades even though I told myself not to... but all in all, it is such a great product and I‚Äôm trying to review the nearly berry but it won‚Äôt change the shade no matter how many times I try lol so this is specifically for nearly berry! So at first I was scared of it and it was the last one I bought but I‚Äôm am presently surprised of how much I love this type of berry!!! Online it looks different but on myself, I love it! It‚Äôs a wine berry if that makes sense! Not as purple as my fav dior berry! Either way, I will buy more!
Overall, this product is great! I have super dry lips bc I got retreatment braces for the top teeth and so far my lips are loving the formula!",natiQ1796,6 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Highly recommend!,"Perfect!!!! The package is extremely slick and clean, with no product oozing out at the cap. Scent is unnoticeable and texture is not sticky or runny. The light touch of colour is very natural and flattering. Formula is nourishing and comfortable. Definitely going to try other colours!",rumyuan18,5 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Awesome,This is a fabulous gloss balm. It's not sticky at all and does keep my lips soft. Love it.,Gonzo10,4 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best gloss EVER!!!,"This is my holy grail lip gloss! It feels soooo silky and smooth on your lips, and adds just the right amount of color! It is extremely hydrating, and it gives you that more natural looking gloss! Perfect for an every day or fancy occasion alike. Absolute fave of mine!!!",GlamorousSinger,3 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nearly Mauve,"So pretty!  It is a very light gloss and the applicator really helps to apply it neatly.  It's pretty sheer, with just a hint of color.  It stayed inside my lip lines well. In the first picture below Nearly Mauve is on the left side.",Ispend2much6,2 Mar 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Really a special formula - in a good way !,"A very thin formula, non sticky, nice delicate smell. Decent wear time for such a thin formula. It's like wearing a balm, in a good way. Packaging is OK, not the biggest fan but that doesn't change the quality of the product.",aeriha,28 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
LOOOOOVE,"This is an amazing gloss. It‚Äôs so light and not sticky at all. It almost feels like a lip balm, nourishing and light. I don‚Äôt usually wear glosses but this is so light It barely feels like a gloss. It‚Äôs very glossy and has a good amount of pigment.",cargas,27 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,i love this lip balm! absolutely beautiful & EXTREMELY hydrating!! Kinda gives the same hydrating as the your fave lip balm but with a beautiful colour! Soo worth the price & doesn‚Äôt feel sticky or uncomfortable.,maya733,27 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
decent lip gloss,Got this in the darkest berry color and then swapped for this pink color. Gave it 4 stars because it‚Äôs a bit thick and sticky and doesn‚Äôt last that long. But overall it‚Äôs good. I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than this for the product though so at this price point I won‚Äôt be returning it.,annakodr,27 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
obsessed,never thought mauve could look so good but i love it a little goes a long way and you don‚Äôt have to reapply every 5 minutes. can‚Äôt recommend it enough tbh,Carolyn08,24 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!!,"Incredible formula and color! I don't use this often because I find that it only looks good when your lips are fully moisturized and there are no dry spots or skin peeling. When I do use this though, it is so beautiful and pleasant to look at. The texture is great, no stickiness to it or anything. It feels like a very nice lip balm with a hint of color to it.",johnnn,24 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
super nourishing and beautiful,These lip balm/gloss hybrids are amazing. They give such a gorgeous look to the lips and it super comfortable. I love how nourishing it feels on my lips compared to other lip glosses. This shade is perfect for my lips it gives a your lip but better vibe to them,Evelynbt,23 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love this lip balm,I really love this lip balm! It keeps my lips nice and hydrated and it adds a nice touch of color. It is not greasy or sticky. I am really looking forward to trying more of her products!!! I. Highly reccomended this lip balm!,jmtar,23 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This has to be my most favourite product I've ever put on my lips! I started with a sample size and immediately knew I wanted the full size! The glossy lip balm makes your lips feel so nourished, hydrated and smooth! It does not feel sticky or clumpy at all. It is a nice subtle hint of colour which is great for us gals who like to have a more subtle makeup #rareroutine  I find myself grabbing for my glossy lip balm ALL THE TIME and not just when I have a full face of makeup! I want all the colours and will absolutely buy again! my FAV Rare product and I've tried many of them!",TheFrew,23 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Hydrating yet still so natural,"Originally got this lip balm as a sample but ended up buying the real deal! Ive seen a-lot of the same comments about how lightweight and natural it is, and i‚Äôve got to say, i feel the exact same way. Im not usually a big fan of lip glosses because of how sticky they are and how bright and unnatural they can come to be. But since this also acts like a lip balm more so than a lip gloss i found this super easy to implement into a daily routine. It does a great job at enhancing your features without coming off as ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. SO WORTH your money!! Ps. Since brown is a trend at the moment, i find that nearly neutral is a super pretty color to have if you‚Äôre into that whole y2k type trend :)",kimbawlee,22 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love it!,I'm so happy with this purchase. I love the consistency of the gloss and the applicator works very well. The color is definitely more on the sheen side and I think it would be a great everyday color.,michelle828,22 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Cute and Hydrating!,"I love the formula! Yes this isn't meant to all day, but to give some color and hydrate. Wearing a mask all day, this has come in handy! Better than a regular balm, its fun!",gengenny,22 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!! My favorite makeup,I love rare beauty products!! Highly recommend this make up!! Selena did a great job !,Mima4500,22 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
OK.,I received a sample of this and decided it‚Äôs not worth buying the full size. The texture is nice and not sticky. The color pay off is very minimal and there isn‚Äôt much last power. Could easily find glosses at the drugstore that are just as nice or better.,GDane14,22 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
MUST PURCHASE,I love Rare Beauty it is hands down my new favourite makeup line. The products are great quality and give me a really natural look especially on my no makeup days. I love the glossy lip balms I own one other shade and I hope to buy all of them in the future,GeriBear135,22 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
OBSESSED OBSESSED OBSESSED,"In general, Rare Beauty is my new favorite cosmetics line. Simply amazing. The prize, quality, packaging. Everything. I've been looking YEARS for the perfect lip gloss: the right formula, amount of color, price, and shade. This is my dream come true. I cannot stop using it. So natural but also buildable if you need a little more color. Ugh I cannot stop raving about it. I want to buy the whole collection. Amazing.",lalillydenyc,21 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Fave lip gloss next to fenty!,"I never write reviews but I had to for this one! Selena deserves her credit for this! This lip gloss is amazing! It's creamy, smooth and non-sticky. I applied this gloss on dry lips with no prep and it instantly moisturized my lips (I have eczema on my lips). It's basically a pretty, creamy vaseline. If you love the fenty lip gloss, you will love this! Also line this with NYX neutral for the perfect nude pink brown lips <3",marivictolero,20 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Great Lip Balm,Great color.  Glides on and lips feel moist.  Bought another color after wearing this one.,bubblydmt,20 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
AMAZING,I love this lipgloss so much! It leaves such a nice pillowy feeling to my lips and the color is beautiful and sheer.,JadeSanchez,20 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Weird colour line,Love the colour and consistency when first applied. After a while the colour makes a ring around my lips and doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm wearing lipgloss that cost $23. I would recommend for someone who doesn‚Äôt have naturally pale lips.,ldianew,19 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Perfection in a lip product! So soft and comfortable!,Stephmarien,19 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Stayed on my lips ALL DAY,So smooth and soft. Love the hint of colour it gives its not too much peach but it‚Äôs just perfect. It stayed ok my lips ALL DAY. The colour did fade because I was eating and had my mask on. But at the end of the day it was still on my lips. Definitely a must have gloss :) I‚Äôll probably be getting the other colours soon,mak611,19 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!,"This product is so good! It is perfectly pigmented, it's not sticky, and there's a great amount of shine to it. The applicator is perfect for getting all around the edge of your lips and then filling in. There is no scent, which is something I love. I am going to need more shades!",Jordynt,18 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Exactly as described!,Glossy lip balm is the perfect way to describe this product. So moisturizing and comfortable. It lasts really well and isn‚Äôt sticky. I‚Äôm pretty fair and was able to use the darkest shade so they are more of a tint of color. I also like the way the packaging is shaped with the flat back so you can lay it down without it rolling over. Very well made product all around. Highly recommend!,mollie622,18 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Formula is very hydrating and wearable. Perfect for when you're looking for a hint of color and a shiny lip. I do think it can feel a little tacky if you layer too much on.,Sam0207,18 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
BESTTT,"SOOOOOO good. I hate fragranced lip products and this one has a super subtle, sweet, not obnoxious scent that goes away quickly. The product itself is A+++++. So nourishing and lasts forever. Has replaced all my daily lip products. Can't stop wearing this!!",christinadibabe,16 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Feels great!,"Worth the hype! I put off ordering this and finally bought it. Feels amazing. Very cushion-y, subtle scent and looks like my lips but better.",ebyya217,16 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Buy this now!,"The YouTube reviews and reviews here are totally accurate! This is the best lipgloss ever. I originally thought the Bobbi Brown crushed lipglosses were my favorite, but I think this has just pushed those aside. It‚Äôs not sticky, and it feels just like a smooth lip balm. The color rose is perfect for me as I am a natural redhead, with fair cool skin. The pink in the lipgloss compliments the pink in my skin nicely. It isn‚Äôt as bright as you would think from the swatches but rather a healthy pink. I already have another color in my cart! Don‚Äôt pass on these!",vicamen,15 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Best lip product ever! Amazing color, looks so shiny and glossy with no sticky feeling. You NEED IT!",rachelg4,14 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,This product was great. Not sticky at all and has no smell. Gave it 4 stars as I wish the colour was a little more pigmented but overall it‚Äôs a really good gloss and I will definitely be purchasing it again.,Jess232323,14 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Great everyday gloss. Just enough shine. Not sticky. No weird smell. Love the color. A must have!,BlondeCocoa,14 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
You must own a shade or all!,"I am floored by this product, the best lip product without taste, scent and smooth.
Great for a hint of shine and slight colour.
Use it with a lip liner or alone. 
I use more natural make up, not foundation!
This does dry fast enough, no streaks, not sticky, I can go on forever. If you want punchy high pigment you should go for her liquid lipstick.
I bought Nearly Apricot blush as well to match.
Just stunning on my normal to dry skin.
Winter here in Montreal and this product used with a brush, fingers or whatever you desire is pretty easy.

I have light golden olive skin winter and can‚Äôt wait to see how it looks during the tanned summer months.
The best celebrity make up ever.
And that says a lot for a 50 year old",Sharon17,13 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"LOVE this product. It‚Äôs a cross between a gloss and a balm, so it‚Äôs not super sticky but has a pretty and minimal shine and color pay off. It also feels moisturizing. Definitely want other colors!",jemmajane,13 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Beautiful buildable colour! I really was surprised at how soft and not sticky it was. Would love to get in more shades.,scrunchiequ33n,11 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Wow,"This lip balm gloss is so cushiony and is not sticky at all. When you are rubbing your lips together, it feels like there's a smooth cushiony gel texture. The texture is very similar to Laneige lip masks but more gel-like. It gives you a gorgeous wash of color on your lips! Love it!!",pokemonmaster01,11 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Absolutely Perfect,"I've been waiting to try this balm after reading the positive reviews and I have not been disappointed! Not sticky, not too shiny, just perfect. Feels nice and smooth on the lips, moist but not heavy, and really lasts. Excited to try other shades.",Fortitude123,10 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Seriously hooked,"I own a lot of lip glosses but this one quickly rose to the top of the pack for me, I hope they come out with a set with all the colors! It's relatively sheer but still has enough pigmentation which makes the color really flattering. Above all the texture is great, it really does feel like a lip balm in terms of the consistency once you apply it and how moisturizing it is.",estragon,10 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Three stars bc this is the best of the bunch 

I have all four shades purchased with my own money. I love these in that the packaging and colors are cute. But why do I feel like these end up on my chin when I wear them.

"so nourishing, soft, lovely!","honestly the best gloss i‚Äôve ever bought (and i have a lottttt) and quite possibly the only colored gloss i anticipate using up... and repurchasing (i‚Äôve only ever used up clear glosses in the past, haha) 
so so nourishing, my lips feel healthier, softer and refreshed for having worn this gloss, on top of the beautiful soft color it gives 
also love that it‚Äôs not overly shiny - so it could even be appropriate in a professional setting (one day... when we return to the office lol)
also love the price point, makes it worth buying even without a sale - definitely would recommend!",thisisabi,10 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
sticky icky icky,"Got a sample of this in my last order and threw it out. It‚Äôs too sticky! Gross. If you‚Äôre getting this because of the price, get Nyx butter gloss instead; the price is amazing and it‚Äôs never sticky. If price isn‚Äôt an issue, then you can‚Äôt beat Marc Jacobs or Nars lipglosses.",xtizzy,10 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
so worth it,"Such a gorgeous glossy lip balm. Amazing quality as well! Non sticky, and soaks into the lips wonderfully leaving this beautiful sheen of color",MireilleG,9 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Perfect Gloss,"Absolutely gorgeous lip gloss shade, I usually do not gravitate towards brown colors but I received it as a free gift with my purchase and it was so stunning and flattering I went in and bought a full size of it. A great soft texture that has a nice glossy look without being sticky.",Elena77,9 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Perfect in every way,"I'm picky when it comes to glosses. They're either too shiny, too sticky, too drying, too....whatever. This gloss however is perfect in every way. Perfect nude shade with just enough color with out detracting from the natural look, adds shine without being obnoxiously shiny, and the right kind of balmy consistency that isn't sticky or drying. It makes my lips feel soft and supple. I will buy this over and over again. looking to try the other colors for some variety too.",huerta55,6 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Buy this gloss!,Got this gloss as freebie and I love it!!!!! I lined my lips and just used this gloss.  It looked like I got my lips done.  It‚Äôs think and pigmented without be sticky or drying.,holly94,5 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
10/10 recommend,"This gloss is seriously amazing. My lips feel so hydrated and soft. The shine is really pretty, too. I've got lighter skin & was worried this nude might wash me out (I've had that problem before), but it looked super nice on!",Falafel33333333,5 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
PERFECT TEXTURE,I love how this lip gloss is not sticky at all! I found the texture kind of the like the Laneige Glowy Balm but less slippery. It really feels like you just put on some hydrating lip balm but you have all the shine and colour of a beautiful lip gloss. Will definitely pick up some more shades!,exrong,4 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

5 stars is not enough,"This lip balm is AMAZING! Non sticky, has a great creamy texture. Also, the colour is just beautiful.",biancalzg86,4 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Exceptional consistency but could be slightly more pigmented. I love how this hydrates and feels on my lips but you have to use a decent amount to see significant color pay off. The applicator is perfection- very precise and easy to use. If you enjoy super glossy balms this product is definitely for you.,misskrystal,3 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"My new favorite lip balm! It has a super bouncy, hydrating texture, unlike anything I've ever tried. The tint is very slight, but gives a nice dash of color to my lips. Would highly recommend to friends and family!",arie1189,3 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
made me buy a second one,I loved it super nourishing and long lasting. I can‚Äôt tell if I have used it a lot or if there just isn‚Äôt a ton of product in it. Non the less the product is worth the amount you get.,Monasprite,3 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love!,"Wow! Obsessed with this texture. So creamy and smooth but very lightweight, feels like the laneige lip sleeping mask. The neutral tone is a perfect sheer wash of color and it actually lasts really well too for a tinted lip balm! Definitely recommend this one!",Tab97,2 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
BEST LIP BALM I'VE EVER TRIED!,"I am SO picky and literally never like a lip balm lol other than Dior Lip Glow balm and I must sayyyy WOW! The fact that it is a ""gloss"" was confusing at first- but when I tried it- SOLD! Its magical. Must have in my purse at all times!",ChristinaJ724,2 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nothing Special,"The Rare Beauty Glossy Lip Balm is nothing special, and  not worth $18 in my opinion. I‚Äôd rather save the $$$ and go with a drug store lip product. I‚Äôve tried better glosses and balms in the $3-5 range. The color does not last even using a lip liner. And the gloss/balm dries quickly not leaving much moisture on the lips. For balms I much prefer Dior, Marc Jacob‚Äôs, and Givenchy. For glosses Fenty and Buxom are much better.",Steffy21,1 Feb 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

,Really pretty color and was really comfortable to wear.,leslesles,31 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I bought this lip balm with blush, and eyeshadow in nearly neutral color. I like the formula, it is very nourishing and comfortable. It is just the color that is not as flattering as I expected. It looks too natural on my lips. Next time maybe I should try more vibrant colors like nearly rose or nearly apricot.",hyunsoo83,31 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
color isn‚Äôt long lasting but beautiful formula,"I love this product so much. I love the component and how it doesn‚Äôt roll off my desk. Having 1000 shades of mauve/neutrals/pinks, I opted for Nearly Berry. It‚Äôs a beautiful wash of color. The formula is a little sticky, but not at all uncomfortable, and really does feel like you‚Äôre applying a balm to your lips! The only reason I knocked off a star is because the color seems to disappear within a half hour or less leaving just the balm. I wish the color itself lasted longer!",lexlivia,31 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
BUY IT!,"WOW, My expectations with this lipgloss were definitely met. This gloss feels amazing- just like a lip balm. It is super lightweight and comfortable. It has great color and shine. I don't like lipglosses that are super thick and heavy, so this is absolutely perfect for me. The color is not too intense- its the perfect amount. It applies so easily and it leaves your lips feeling and looking soooo moisturized.",Rocky444,30 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Don‚Äôt quite get the hype...,"For me, this is a very OK product. Full disclosure- I‚Äôm working off of the free Sephora sample that was on promo but In comparing it to several other products, this would get a pass from me. It‚Äôs *nice* but just ok.  I‚Äôm a huge fan of ‚Äúyour lips but better‚Äù type glosses but this doesn‚Äôt do it for me for a few reasons- 1. color payoff could be better. One layer doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference for me and I find I still have to use a lip liner or put on 2-3 coats. 2. Texture is ok- it‚Äôs creamy, but nothing revolutionary. 3. Longevity is meh. I was just wearing this around the house and found without eating and drinking it was gone within 20-30 min. If a friend were asking, I would recommend Tower28 cashew, the lip retreat oil by Wander Beauty or even the Fenty Glow gloss bomb over this.",malloroid,30 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Love! Very glossy and moisturizing. This shade is like a ‚Äúyour lip color but better‚Äù type of shade.,Kelhoo,30 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
phenomenal lip product! a must try!,"Firstly, I purchased this product on my own with my own money. Now that‚Äôs out of the way- I couldn‚Äôt be more in love with it! It feels SO cushiony and soft, making my lips feel so hydrated. Although it may not last HOURS on end, this is exactly what it states- a glossy feeling balm. The sheer wash of colour is a gorgeous bonus to the feel! This is my favourite colour, so I picked this one for the review. I have since purchased a back up as well as 4 more colours!! I couldn‚Äôt be happier and recommend this product to anyone who‚Äôs interested!",svenditto,30 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Perfect product that feels like a mask!,"The 
most comfortable lipgloss I own! Aside from my Laneige lip mask, I think this product feels the best on my lips. It actually has the same feel and look as the Laneige lip mask but has color and is spreadable. It‚Äôs shiny, has a long wear time and nourishing and I hope they come out with more colors!",meghanwink,30 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
nearly neutral!,"Soooo I really didn‚Äôt want to like this cause I believe anything with a celebrity on it is pretty much a gimmick. I will say this lip balm is unique. It applies like a gloss like application but feels like a balm on the lips, it‚Äôs kind of trippy but I love it. Obsessed. I know I have to buy the other colors now. Nearly Neutral is for everyone.",cschirner,29 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!,"I love the color. Buildable and lasting. I love the shape of the wand for the corners of the mouth. really does feel like balm, while looking like a gloss. Bf doesn't mind kissing me with this gloss on verses other glosses.",ToniMash,29 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Amazing feel,Feels like her soft matte lip creams but glossy! I haven‚Äôt felt anything like this and love it! Stays on longer than a gloss does,allytollison,29 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
A fantastic unique lipgloss,"This is a great new and unique formula. It really makes my lips look plump and juicy. The texture is incredible, I‚Äôve never experienced a lipgloss like this. The texture is so dreamy it makes me want to rub my lips together all the time, haha. I feel like because of it‚Äôs texture it clings (in a good way) to my lips and lasts a really long time. It looks like when the product warms up on the lips it gets even more shiny! There is minimal colour payoff, but thats what I look for in a gloss. If I need colour, I‚Äôll pair it with a lipstick or something. There is no scent which is fantastic to those who are sensitive to it. I think I‚Äôm going to end up buying all the lipglosses.",Dxddykatty,29 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
A Great Everyday Gloss,"Although I usually am not a fan of glosses, I love how this shade adds a little color back to my lips. It's also not sticky at all, which is definitely a plus. If you're looking for a Zoom-friendly gloss that makes you feel and look alive again, I'd highly recommend this one.",MishtotheMash,28 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"The Best Neutral, Subtle Lip Gloss","I love lip gloss and it has always been a go to lip wear for me. I really wanted to try this lipgloss because unlike most glosses, this one does not have any shimmer or sparkles. I wanted to find a gloss that I could feel good in and wear everyday and not be super extra. I love the feeling of the formula, I also love reapplying and the colour is definitely their and sometimes subtle depending on how many coats of gloss you use. It‚Äôs hydrating as well. I do find sometimes that the formula can get a bit sticky after a while of wearing it but I just reapply and it‚Äôs all good! I actually really look forward to reapplying because I love the way the product feels! I definitely want to get the rest of the collection because it‚Äôs so versatile and subtle.",Inuri,28 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Perfect neutral with wonderful feel,"I received a tiny sample of this as a bonus in the Nearly Neutral. Not expecting much, I used it and discovered that it‚Äôs probably the best applicator-style shiny lip gloss I have ever used! I love it! It is a gorgeous smooth texture, not a bit of stickiness. This color is just perfect for a natural everyday look! It has no discernible scent, which is fine with me. And it lasts! I even wear it under a mask because it feels so nourishing for my lips. I am here to get the full-sized option before I run out! In love with this, highly recommended!",kcarn,28 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Super cute & hydrating,"Since it says this is a lip balm I just thought i should mention it‚Äôs more like a gloss. I was expecting it to have a bit more of a tint to it, but that's on me for picking the lightest shade, personally I think it‚Äôs a really cute natural tone and it does give my lips a natural-looking pink color and it leaves a pretty shine on them, nothing too crazy.  I honestly love it, I‚Äôm not a big fan of lipglosses but this one just feel so nice and it‚Äôs also very hydrating, def one of my faves.",KarianaGalvan,27 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Wow!,Such a perfect color! I am fairly pale and this is such a warm yet beautiful neutral - versatile + sexy. I love how it feels and it the longevity of the color and gloss is incredible. I actually prefer this over my Buxom gloss. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this more!,cassiekeller,27 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nice,"How you would rate this product depends on what you‚Äôre looking for in a colored lip balm. If you‚Äôre looking for a pigmented gloss, this is not it. The shade was so light, (not sure how other colors would be) that it made hardly
no difference to my lips. At first I was like what the! Because I got this as a free sample and quickly realized this was a gloss and not a lipstick. There was so little pigment I was stunned. As everyone claims, it is not sticky but extremely glossy, which is why I chose to rate this product so high. It doesn‚Äôt feel cakey which I love, and it really does leave my lips feeling soft and hydrated. As the product description claims this will ‚Äúleave your lips looking plump‚Äù eh, no, not at all.",kianahas,27 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
The best balm/gloss,I love the neutral shade. I don‚Äôt have much pigment in my lips so this gives me a natural looking color. It probably won‚Äôt show up much on pigmented lips but it really hydrates and isn‚Äôt sticky. It gives a nice glossy look without the blingy shine and no stickiness. The scent is very mild.,glossadd,27 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Super cute,"This lipgloss will make anyone love glosses. The color is super cute, and it lasts for a good amount of time. The formula is not sticky at all, something that you don‚Äôt see in other lip gloss products.",jonamstl,27 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
It's A Good Gloss,I really like this because it's not sticky. It's a nice color. Lasting power is about what you would expect a normal lip color.,kaylakane,27 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
My everyday lip!,I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I first off loved the packaging. The unique shaped tube is so innovative and sleek. It‚Äôs not round but more of a ‚ÄúD‚Äù shape so it does not roll off the table. The texture is never sticky and it‚Äôs so smooth on my lips. It hydrates my lips while also providing a glossy finish. I always have such dry lips so this balm moisturizes my lips while giving it a flush of natural color.,monigee,27 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
a must have!,"i was really excited to try this product because i love the message and aspirations behind selena‚Äôs beauty line. anyways, this is literally the best gloss/balm i own. the formula is soooooooo good. it feels like a liquid balm but leaves such a nice shine on the lips. the colours are sheer but it‚Äôs definitely buildable. and honestly- not sure why there were comments about it being sticky because you‚Äôd have to put way too much product to experience that. overall, i love this balm. i purchased the nearly mauve one and i immediately purchased nearly apricot the day after. now, im looking to purchase nearly rose! a must have!",ld1616,27 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I really enjoy this product. It is very hydrating on the lips and lasts a decent amount of time. I think it gives the lips a beautiful light wash of color and is very comfortable to wear. I really enjoy the packaging it is beautiful,blgaudett,26 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Hydrating and the most creamiest velvet lip balm. Definitely my new favorite and purchasing more.,EliVasquez,26 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
new favorite!,"love this! nearly rose is a perfect pink- like your lips but better! looks good on it‚Äôs own or with a lip liner :) definitely my new everyday lip product, it‚Äôs so pretty and hydrating. it has more of a gel-like feel instead of a gloss (if that makes sense?lol) and doesn‚Äôt wear off quickly. i love the packaging and applicator too! will definitely repurchase once i run out. yet another amazing product from rare beauty!",babypinkbtch,26 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Great Balm that feels like a gloss!,"I love this product. It‚Äôs a gloss that feels like a balm. The formula goes on easily and does not feel sticky. My lips stay moisturized, even if I don‚Äôt reapply (although I recommend reapplying when needed for that shine and moisture). The shade I tried was apricot, which a pigment that is subtle, but does not come off clear on the lips. I would love to try different shades to see which one works better for me.",TinDelaRosa,26 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Love this gloss. I appreciate her conscious products and decent price.  It is a thick gloss but I wanted something without the buxom tingle.,ellie12,26 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Awesome gloss!!!,"Love this gloss so much! Super similar formula to the Tower28 ones where it isn‚Äôt sticky, but almost slippery. It‚Äôs comfortable, pigmented, and has such a gorgeous shine. Only thing to note...when first applied, there‚Äôs a TINY bit of a tingling? It goes away really fast though, and isn‚Äôt painful. Such a great gloss!",SareBear89,26 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,First impressions: really comfortable on the lips! I love a good hydrating lip product. This one is a mix of a gloss and a balm (hence the name). I definitely think this will be a staple once we can start wearing lip products out of the house again!,chloelizabethhh,26 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I‚Äôm obsessed with this lip product. It feels super smooth and hydrating on the lips. It‚Äôs not a color I would normally go for but it‚Äôs very beautiful for fall/winter. I‚Äôm excited to check out the other shades.,Erink999,25 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nice gloss!,I have been enjoying this gloss so far! My only complaint is that the doe foot is really small and pointy but other than that I think the product is great! I was worried that the color would be too bright but it is really sheer and looks like a slight berry tint on the lips!,mackenzie1111,25 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love this gloss!,I absolutely loved this lip gloss! I chose the darker berry color and although it wasn‚Äôt super pigmented I liked that. The lipgloss adds a subtle color and it stays on for a decent amount of time! Over all I really recommend this!,kenny42,25 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I received this complimentary from Rare Beauty for review. I usually prefer a stick lip balm because I find that lip glosses are too thick however I like the formula of this glossy lip bomb. It‚Äôs not as sticky as a typical lip gloss, and I find that it left my lips very hydrated and smooth. The shade Nearly Berry is very dark in the tube but applies sheer on my lips and complemented my skin tone. The packaging is very sleek and the smart design with one side flat ensures the tube doesn‚Äôt roll off a table. I recommend this to someone looking for a hydrating lip balm with a hint of color.",AHeatedMess,25 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best Gloss to Buy,"I got an email that I could receive a free sample of this product, and I immediately began my quest for finding items that would add up to the minimum purchase amount to qualify for it (it wasn't very difficult haha). The gloss is silky smooth, and I love how you can layer it for different effects with the color. Bonus: you can wear it over the cream lipstick to give it a shiny finish! This beauty keeps my lips hydrated all day, and it isn't sticky like most glosses are. Will definitely be buying the full-size next time!",SouthernBelle27,25 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I love the texture of this gloss. It is somewhat thick but non-sticky, pigmented and long-lasting! I will definitely be picking up some more shades and I hope they expand the range as the formula is really quite wonderful.",chhloe,25 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Beautiful and Hydrating,"I love lip gloss so this is amazing for me. Especially during this time in the middle of winter I definitely needed something hydrating for my lips. The shade is pretty and perfect for everyday wear (I got nearly neutral), and the gloss is just super pretty.",GennySnail,25 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
BEST LIPGLOSS,"Honestly my new favorite lipgloss. It‚Äôs not super sticky, and the color is so gorgeous. I got the shade ‚ÄúNearly Apricot‚Äù, it‚Äôs like sheer but gives a perfect natural color. It doesn‚Äôt have a smell, but it honestly feels like it‚Äôs barely there. Love!!",Alyxodonnell,25 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Almost Too Neutral,"This is a nice gloss with balm-like qualities.  If you're looking for a ""pop of colour"", I would start with one of the other colours.  Nearly Neutral is ""Nearly Not There"" as far as tint goes.  The tube in real life looks brown.  It is not pigment-heavy but rather a very sheer wash of colour that can build slightly.",Lilibeth26,25 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
One of my holy grails,This lip gloss is amazing. It moisturizes my lips while still keeping its shine. I have very dry lips and this kept them feeling supple the entire day.,KYW02,24 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Tinted lip balm,"This is an $18 tinted lip balm. Barely any color and zero gloss. You can get cheaper tinted balms at drug stores. It does feel smooth and non-sticky, but I would not buy this. The applicator does not pull much product out either.",artimake,24 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!,I am loving the nearly neutral shade. Its sheer and makes my lips pop with that natural color. The consistency is amazing and it feels super soft when applied. I am usually picky with lip glosses because they tend to be sticky or goopy but this one is just very hydrating and perfect for everyday use plus it smells amazing! Will definitely be getting a few other shades!,Jackiespadoni,24 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Super comfortable on the lips,"This looks like a lip gloss, but it‚Äôs super comfortable on the lips and it feels like a lip balm too. The shade I got is more of a brown color compared to the liquid eyeshadow in the same color, but they‚Äôre still in the same color family and complement each other. So if you‚Äôre looking for a lip color the same shade as the eyeshadow, keep that in mind!",Sofinaa,24 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Not buying again!,"Horrible, feels like petroleum jelly on your lips with hardly any color pay off! This is like the 5th  product from her line that Iv tried and it‚Äôs safe to say this makeup line is not good. Will not be buying anything from it again and do not recommend it to anyone. Poor quality. Very disappointed!",shayxo555,24 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
more lip balm than gloss,"This lip product is more of a lip balm than a gloss. It has the shine that a lip balm would give you, however, I do enjoy it. I received a sample of the soft neutral with a purchase and so I can‚Äôt attest to color payoff because it matches my lips. I am looking forward to trying the other colors.",AJAR2009,24 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
True to name,"Just like the name says, this is definitely a lip balm with a glossy finish. If you‚Äôre expecting a gloss, this is not it. It‚Äôs a super sheer color with a thick, balmy consistency. It feels so nice on the lips and it‚Äôs perfect for winter especially under a mask. I like to wear it with a lip liner underneath for some more pigment. This is more if you want a natural/no makeup makeup look and it doesn‚Äôt leave a really pretty shine on the lips. It‚Äôs thick but not gloopy or overly sticky, and it stays on really well!",ev345,23 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This has to be my absolute favorite new lips gloss! The color is so fresh and pretty! Unlike most glosses that only are colorful in the bottle, this actually provides the perfect amount of sheer color and moisture!",SelenaFaith,23 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing lipgloss for every day wear!,"I was so excited to hear Selena Gomez had launched a makeup line & even more excited to see that the shades are inclusive! I don‚Äôt wear lip gloss very often, but when I just want a little pop of color, this lip gloss is perfect!!! I love the sleek packaging it comes in & it applies beautifully onto the lips! It has a light scent, not strong at all & I can almost feel it plumping a bit after applied! It‚Äôs not sticky at all, which is my favorite part about this gloss! Overall, I love this lip gloss & so happy I got to be a part of this launch!",anm278,23 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"The moment I used this I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. The color was the same as my own lips. I got this as a sample so if I do purchase the full size I wouldn‚Äôt pick this color personally. It goes on nice, not overly glossy and looks classy. Great glossy lip balm!",BlueAnya,23 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Ultra comfortable!,I love the way this balm feels on my skin. The color is also super sheer so it doesn‚Äôt look odd applying it with no makeup on. This has quickly become my favorite lip balm product I just so with it wasn‚Äôt $18 I would be more thrilled with buying multiples and backups if it was in the 12-15 dollar price range!,emmnickel,23 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best lip product!,I love these glossy lip balms. I don‚Äôt typically put too much time into my lips for makeup but this balm goes on so smoothly and looks gorgeous. It‚Äôs an easy way to add a pop of color! The texture of these are perfect!,Madz2021,23 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Lightweight and non sticky,I love that it left my lips hydrated. Definitely need every single color . The formula is lightweight and non-sticky. I really love the application wand! The color is even and pretty pigmented while still being sheer.,JulianaPayind,23 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
so comfortable!,"The name of this product perfectly describes it. A glossy lip balm, it is comfortable like a balm, but still feels like it stays in place and doesn‚Äôt slide around to much like a slippy balm. The shade I have is nearly berry. It sheers out beautifully so it isn‚Äôt an overly dark shade which I like. I love the shine and the color so much. I also really the packaging. The one complaint would be that it‚Äôs not the most long lasting lip product. But I still want more shades, definitely eyeing nearly neutral.",daphnerouge,23 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
lip gloss or the best lip balm with glossy color?,You need it if you love the gloss with every moisturizing benefit out there most comfortable gloss I‚Äôve ever tried it makes me happy wearing it,Baylee27,23 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Amazing! I love the way the wand curves the lips upon application, making it easy to apply. The gloss is perfect consistency, with no ‚Äústicky‚Äù feel and perfect natural gloss appeal. The colour range is my personal favourite, because I love natural colour tones. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a natural gloss, that works as a chapstick and lipstick. :)",NaturalFrers,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love this gloss!!,I think I really like this gloss! I have very dry lips so I was interested to see how moisturizing this would be. It is not sticky which I love. It smells SO good! I will say it seems to bleed a little. I lined my lips but it seemed to feather out past my liner. Still would love to try this in more colors!,YoutuberSarah,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I got this today and my lips were very dry, cracked and even split (can‚Äôt wear a mask with lip balm, I breakout around my mouth). I decided to try it on because I was more interested in the color but to my amazement it hydrated my lips and smoothed them out too. No sticky feeling what so ever. Just very comfortable even cushiony. Needless to say I‚Äôm getting all of them.",AlexRenee,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Sticky.,It‚Äôs so sticky. Not sure why it has such high reviews honestly.,jars90s,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nearly Muave for Medium skin tones,"Love this color it‚Äôs great for my medium skin complexion, the gloss is slightly sticky makes your lips soft and moisturized. Has a very light scent and the lip gloss tube has a flat surface great when placing it on a table so it won‚Äôt fall off easily like other round tubes do so.",KitkatNina88,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I‚Äôm not usually a huge fan of glosses but I thought I‚Äôd give this one a try. I love the fact that it‚Äôs also a lip balm! The texture is thicker but the formula itself isn‚Äôt sticky like a lot of glosses. I got the shade Nearly Natural and it‚Äôs the perfect nude!,obssedwiththis,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Just purchased this lip gloss and I have to say this maybe my new favorite lip gloss! Plus I love the color selection such classy and feminine,Alyssachar,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
I love it,It has a nice light berry rose color. Not that pigmented which I personally love. It feels soft on the lips and not sticky like a lot of glosses.,maryjanevc,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
best gloss ever!,This lipgloss is the most comfortable lipgloss I have ever tried! I love it! Feels super moisturizing and the color is beautiful!!,Baileyjohnson16,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Makes Me Feel Pretty!,"I‚Äôd like to preface this to say that I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the regular lip balms, mainly the taste that the fragrance left behind. I‚Äôm so happy to report that it‚Äôs been a wayyyy better experience with the Glossy Lip Balm! This does still have the same fragrance, but to a much lesser degree that isn‚Äôt an issue. The texture is thicker than a traditional gloss which helps with lasting power. Just be sure to exfoliate before use as it can collect in the center of the lips if they‚Äôre dry. Overall a product I think most would enjoy!",betablinx85,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I‚Äôve only use this glossy lip balm a few times, but it‚Äôs a very pretty color. It‚Äôs not too sticky. And it‚Äôs more of a lip gloss, then a balm. The color I received was nearly Mauff. And it is such a beautiful color for fall. And I love the packaging. And the price.",KaylaFul,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
new fave lip product,"It feels like a balm but looks like a gloss. It is so great! I have very pale skin and like to wear a subtle makeup look every day, and this colour was perfect, even though it was the darkest shade! Got one for my mom for Valentine‚Äôs Day and will continue to recommend this product to those who love gloss and lip balm!",jamiemadison6,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Very hydrated lips with this,I tried a lipgloss like this before. It‚Äôs definitely glossy but without the thick stickiness texture to it. I love that it left my lips hydrated and that the color pay off is amazing. I will definitely be picking up the other colors.,glosspray,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Yes yes yes!,this beautiful glossy lip balm! It‚Äôs so hydrating! I love how it looks and feels on my lips and lasts thro the mask! Definitely need every single color she came out with. I got mine in the shade mauve.,faithtrouble,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
buy this immediately,MY PERFECT EVERYDAY LIP!!!!! Got this as a sample and immediately bought 2 full sized ones. Thick but not gloopy with sheer pigment that doesn't sink into the lines on your lips. Adds nice shine without being an exaggerated wet look. Long lasting moisture. When I wear it I feel like a Botticelli girl.,emmeliagirlie,22 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
New fav gloss!,"This gloss is perfect! The formula is lightweight, non-sticky, and comfortable, yet still delivers that juicy, wet pout. I love the idea of a nourishing gloss, and this was a hit for me. My lips always feel softer and more supple after use. The shade ‚Äúnearly apricot‚Äù is such a fun pop of color to add to any look. The color payoff is beautiful; more than a sheer wash of color, yet not quite opaque. A new favorite gloss in my book!",thoughtsofgloss,21 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Moisturizing and feels comfortable on lips,This lipgloss is amazing! It is so moisturizing and feels so good on my lips.  The formula is one of the best I‚Äôve used. It makes lips shiny but not tacky or sticky. The packaging is super chic. I love the clear container and chic gold top. The color on me is a really pretty sheer rose. Overall I really love this lipgloss and want it in every shade now!,,21 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Make lips hydrated,"I am not very into to dark color lips but I loved this color when I saw it. Besides the amazing color, it makes my lips hydrated and soft and I love how it looks. It last for a long time even when you eat and drink. Highly recommend this brand.",mayraderinger,21 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love it,I really love the application wand! It almost acts as a hydrating liner before I use the balm to fill in my lips. It feels so hydrating and smooth without any sticky feel. I also love the slight color it gives my lips.,yoginichick,21 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
New Go-To Gloss,"I got this as the free sample when you spend $25. Holy cow. It's SO. COMFORTABLE. I'm getting the full size in two colors. The color is even and pretty pigmented while still being sheer. By far the most moisturizing gloss I have, even more so than glossier, tower28, or Fenty. It doesn't have the same glassy look as others, but rather a slightly glossy look, like when a lip gloss settles into your lips. Looks pretty and feels even better on the lips. 5/5",adartsea,21 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
My favorite from the stay vulnerable collection!,I am obsessed with the stay vulnerable glossy lip balm. It feels so nice on my lips. It gives them a nice shine and locks in moisture. At the end of the day when I take off my makeup my lips feel so smooth. I can't stand drying lip products and rare beauty has made a wonderful product that looks good and feels good. 10/10 would recommend!,Sunflowerpower1,21 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
buy it you won‚Äôt regret it,My favorite lipgloss literally obsessed it‚Äôs looks so natural with a hint of color as it‚Äôs describe perfect for everyday !! i never write reviews but this product is so good I had to. I have 3 out of the 5 color trust will be getting the other 2,esme6,21 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Amazingly formula, not sticky!","The formula is amazing, I loved the way my lips felt with it on. It‚Äôs not sticky whatsoever, and give the perfect amount of color to the lips. The applicator is also amazing, as it helps give a precise application.",Jcouture7,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Light pigment,This lip gloss was very nice. It lasted and wasn‚Äôt tacky feeling. I loved the packaging. It looked very luxurious and was an affordable cost. I really loved that it is cruelty  free. I was slightly disappointed in the pigment. It looks super pigmented in the bottle but goes on very light.,trobin2679,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
AMAZING!!!,"Ok this is the best lipgloss I bought so far!!! Nice hint of Color and the feeling it leaves on your lips ... wow! Not sticky , Keeps your lips hydrated, fills in the lines in your lips and surprisingly last long time ! A must have !",Jeanie82,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Super love this! Not too glossy. Highly recommended,jaejaemon,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I love this gloss! I bought the nearly neutral collection with the exception of the gloss. I got this as a free sample. I am surprised at how much I like this. This gloss is unlike any formula I love that it is not sticky it moisturizes so nicely. I love it I just ordered the full size. If you don‚Äôt like sheer color you might not like this it does have some color pay off but more on the sheer side. I don‚Äôt mind it especially because I don‚Äôt have any gloss like this I truly love the formula.,Makeupjunkie1xo,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Feels so good on the lips,"I love the formula of this lip gloss. It feels substantial but is not sticky. The color, nearly neutral is such a flattering shade. Even after the formula wears off my lips are left feeling soft and moisturizer.",prettytonii29,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Phenomenal!!!,"I have been searching for a perfect gloss for so long and I‚Äôve finally found the one! I can‚Äôt believe how beautiful these glosses are! They aren‚Äôt sticky whatsoever, feel sooo smooth and creamy on the lips, have a beautiful colour playoff, and are pretty long lasting! My lips feel super moisturized whenever I wear these and I love that all of the colours are pretty universal and natural looking! Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love a sparkly gloss as much as the next girl but sometimes you just want a super natural glossy lip look and with these that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre going to get! In my opinion these glosses are even better than the Fenty gloss bomb‚Äôs! I find with the Fenty glosses they can be a little sticky and I can taste the gloss all the time which is pretty off putting but with these you can‚Äôt taste a thing and there‚Äôs zero stickiness. After trying this shade I immediately went and bought nearly neutral and nearly apricot and I‚Äôll probably end up picking up the other shades as well since they are stunning! Give them a try, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll end up as obsessed with this product as I am! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",AshCadoo,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Best lip gloss I‚Äôve ever tried! When you gloss it over it‚Äôs not sticky at all. It makes your lips look amazing and hydrated. The shade is definitely a natural one. It‚Äôs perfect for running errands or if you just want to make yourself look presentable for the day. I will be trying out other shade colors for this lip balm.,moonzee94,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Must buy gloss!!,I love love love this gloss. The color is perfect! It‚Äôs not heavy or sticky. My lips feel so hydrated. Hands down my favorite gloss. I‚Äôll be getting this on repeat.,MichelleVUT,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love it!,"After reading the reviews, I had to give this a try. This lip balm is AMAZING! It's glossy but not sticky. My lips felt nourished. Nearly Neutral gives my lips a soft and natural glossy look. This shade will look fabulous on anyone.",teresainez,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Very moisturizing, not too sticky or glossy. Super soft on the lips feels like a lip balm, very subtle shine its similar to a lip mask therefore not a lot of pigment. I really wanted to love it because its selena gomez! But it did not do it for me, its not one I would reach for.",CruzEvelyn831,20 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best lip gloss!,"I‚Äôm going to get this lip gloss in every shade! It is the most moisturizing lip gloss I have ever tried. It feels like I‚Äôm wearing my laneige lip mask! It‚Äôs not sticky at all. I love the color pay off, it‚Äôs sheer but adds a great color to your lips. Would highly recommend!",paytonnlee,19 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

The perfect non-sticky gloss,"It is extremely nourishing and super comfortable! It gives the perfect amount of gloss without feeling sticky on the lips, it‚Äôs the perfect hybrid between a lipstick and a balm. Love love the formula, very unique and worth the money.",glittercrocs,19 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This is SUCH a great product! I love how comfortable it is on the lips‚Äîit‚Äôs shiny and juicy without being sticky. It leaves such a nice flush of color that you can build upon a little, or use over a lipliner/lipstick if you want a bolder color with comfortable shine. I got Nearly Neutral, which for me, is almost like a ‚Äúyour lips but better‚Äù shade; the attached photos show my natural lip color with no product (not even chapstick) and with a couple layers of the glossy lip balm for comparison. I definitely recommend and can‚Äôt wait to try the other shades (already ordered Nearly Berry)!",Alicksandruh,19 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"So balmy, hydrating and very comfortable on the lips. The color is sheer so it's perfect for a natural look. It's the right amount of glossiness and it looks really cute. I can see myself using this everyday, especially during the dryer months since it provides a beautiful tint with a lot of hydration.",LinhLai,19 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
I‚Äôm in love!,"Texture. Texture. Texture. Holy smokes do I love the texture of this product! It‚Äôs hydrating but not sticky. I haven‚Äôt worn lip gloss since highschool and still have PTSD from getting my hair stuck to it but I decided to try this due to the review. Legit, this lipgloss is genuinely smooth and nice and not sticky and lasted through 2 coffees. I‚Äôm a fan!",Mimiii90,19 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Not great,"This was unfortunately a huge miss for me. The gloss feels hydrating but there's barely any color payout nor does it stay on for long. For comparison, I have a NYX butter gloss in Praline that I purchased for 8$ CDN which I personally found was a lot better than this gloss. I posted a picture comparing the two (NYX is on the left, RB on the right). For such a large disparity in the price, I didn't find this lipgloss great.",Sabeebs,19 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
LOVE!!,"I have the world‚Äôs driest lips, like I put on the Laneige mask during the day because it‚Äôs the only thing that works for my dry lips! This is genuinely so moisturizing and balmy I was surprised! The flush of color is beautiful, and it makes your lips almost look fuller because of how unique the formula is. The hydrating/healing feeling lasted a long time, and I was really impressed by this overall. I‚Äôm 100% going to buy the other four shades because this is a PERFECT solution for wanting glossy lips but not letting them suffer!",claudiaisa15,19 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Hydrating Holy Grail product,"now liiiiiiiiiisten! 
having dry skin and dry lips is a disastrous combo. this glossy lip balm was amazing, but the feel is exactly like an overnight lip mask! specifically the texture is similiar to the Tatcha Lip Kissu!!  I loved it so much that I ordered Nearly Apricot and Nearly Mauve. definitely a product that will be in every purse, grab and go! It's an easy no fuss process, and I love the packaging! how it won't move or bulge.",nymeriarain,19 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Moisturizing quality lip gloss,Moisturizing quality lip gloss. I got a free sample but I loved it. It's a quality lip gloss that's moisturizing and feels nice on the lips. it has a beautiful tint. I got a free sample now I will buy the full sized gloss.,musicangelus,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Fun new gloss,"Love this light lip tint! Super hydrating and the color is sheet enough not to stain your lips but to give a fresh color. No scent or smells, which I absolutely love. The application is very smooth !!",Azanique,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Quality lip gloss but overwhelming fragrance,"Very pretty shade and moisturizes my lips! I could definitely see incorporating this into my regular rotation, if it wasn't for one problem.... the fragrance is overwhelming! In the bottle it doesn't smell like much but once you put it on your lips it has a very cologne-y and spicy scent. It kind of reminds me of an old man's aftershave. If you like that then this is the lip gloss for you but I am sensitive to strong smells and can see this giving me a headache at some point.",Allie307,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love at first sight,"I have no idea what made me want to try this gloss so badly but when I did, it truly was love at first sight. I left the store to see how it would wear before I purchased it but when I got in my car and saw how good I looked, I immediately went back in sephora to buy it lol I couldn‚Äôt just wait til my next Sephora visit to buy it! The color and the formula are AMAZING. I never write reviews but I just couldn‚Äôt not share this",Carolinades,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
YES YES YES,"Holy holy. This lip balm is new levels amazing! I was so so shook when I put it on. Not only does it give the most beautiful flush of color, but it‚Äôs also absurdly comfortable - it literally feels like a balm! I can‚Äôt recommend this product enough!",iperlz,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This gloss is so comfortable to wear. It feels like a hydrating balm and I love the sheer tint it leaves on the lips. I feel like it fills in my lip lines and it‚Äôs pretty long wearing, it lasted a few hours on my lips. The formula is a little thick, but it‚Äôs not goopy. The packaging is sleek and I like that it won‚Äôt roll of my table. It has a very subtle scent and it doesn‚Äôt taste like anything- good or bad.",jessiemreyes,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Surprisingly Impressive!,"Had to write a review. This is EXACTLY what I look for in a gloss! The texture is a medium viscosity‚Äînot as thin as the Tower28 gloss and not as thick as the Glossier gloss. It is luxuriously balmy, smooth, shiny, and self leveling. The gloss feels nourishing and moisturizing, similar to the Laneige lip mask. I have fair skin with cool/pink undertones and the Nearly Mauve shade makes my natural lip color slightly darker and richer. It really achieves the ‚Äúmy lips but better + a flair‚Äù type of look. If you love sheer, slightly buildable gloss shades, you will love this formula. Also, the shine, color, and possibly the formula itself did give my lips a plumper appearance which is always a bonus! The product lasts as long as a gloss typically does‚Äîyou can wear it for an hour or two before you need to retouch but it does fade beautifully. I am highly impressed!",KacieAnne,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
If Roen and Tower 28 had a baby...,"Given this day and age, a lip balm is more of my go-to than a lipstick. This formula is reminiscent of the Roen Kiss My Liquid Lip Balm (no longer sold on Sephora, unfortunately) and Tower 28 glosses. If those two had a baby, this is their pride and joy. It's not as pigmented as Roen and the texture is not as slippy as Tower 28 on the lips. It's balmy when you rub your lips together (so yummy), not as thin as a traditional stick balm and not as thick as a gloss like Tower 28. It's not the most long lasting, but it fades nicely and leaves my lips so hydrated even after a couple hours (I tend to have dry lips). I tried a sample of this while purchasing the melting blushes. I went out and got a full size because I was using this tiny sample everyday!",ereekat,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now. The formula is really moisturizing, but it does seem to wear away quickly and leave an unattractive patchy appearance.  It gives a wash of color so not like a full lipstick by any means, but more than a clear balm. Definitely recommend checking it out.",JuliaDemchuk,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love love love!,"I‚Äôve been absolutely loving this lip balm! This gives such incredible hydration with a beautiful glossy finish. I was so impressed the first time I applied this balm, it‚Äôs thick and pillowy and lasts a really good amount of time on the lips. My lips still felt hydrated and I could still feel the balm 2 hours after application. The color is subtle so this will be great to keep in my bag and apply on the go! I‚Äôve been reaching for this a ton and will definitely check out some of the other shades!",kaylaniicolle,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Call me impress by this one,"I must confess, I was very curious about this Rare Beauty new product. The shade that spoke to me the most was ""Nearly Berry"" which looks really nice of my fair skin. This Glossy Lip Balm is like anything I have tried before. I was impressed by the texture of the product -  it feels exactly as a cushion that hugs your lips and offers them long lasting hydration and a bit of shine. The color is buildable, discreet (don't except any crazy shades of berry), but I don't recommend overdoing it, because this product is so hydrating that you don't need to build up layers. It offers enough color and shine, again without that stickiness. I was quite impressed that it stayed well under my mask too. Beautiful and ergonomic packaging, awesome formula, great performance on the lips, this one is a WINNER!",Rally16,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
STOP LOOKING! This is the perfect gloss ‚ô•Ô∏è,"I had been looking for months a product to hydrate my lips and look cute at the same time. I was tired of chapstick but needed something to replace it with to keep my lips from getting chapped during winter. Now my lips are hydrated, the color looks beautiful and it lasts. Also it doesn‚Äôt stick to your face mask! Love it!",MoniGuinn,18 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Exactly what it says it is!,I bought the shade nearly rose and it‚Äôs a beautiful pinky shade. I‚Äôll start by saying the majority of shadows crease on me so I didn‚Äôt have high hopes for this. But I applied this directly to my eye without priming and it blended out beautifully and stayed out ALL day. I even wore it for a 12 hr nursing shift and it barely budged. It does dry quickly so I would recommend doing one eye at a time. But I was definitely surprised by how good this is and recommend it! I hope they come out with some more neutral shades.,,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
MUST HAVE,"I never write reviews but once I received this product I knew I was going to have to. I chose Nearly Berry because the pictures made the shade look like it would compliment my skin tone amazingly and that‚Äôs exactly what it did. I have been looking for a berry colored lip product that wasn‚Äôt too bold (I wanted more of a tint) and that‚Äôs exactly what I got with this gloss balm! I love it and I can‚Äôt wait to purchase the gloss balm in every single other color available! If you‚Äôre thinking about buying this product, this is your sign to go do so",patriciaam,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
it‚Äôs whatever,"Meh! It‚Äôs was okay nothing too excited. I really wanted to like this product, but it didn‚Äôt have much of a tint. When I applied it ...I was ready to remove it.... felt heavy.....",VontssJaylin,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
My new favorite gloss!,Rare Beauty has hit it out of the park again with these glosses! They are the perfect wash of color on the lips and are so comfy to wear! They are smooth and not sticky at all. I will definitely be picking up more colors!,hollieb,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
I wish they made a clear version!,"I love this. It gives the lips an almost gel cushion when you rub them together. The closest comparison I can think of, texture wise, is the Laneige lip mask, except that one dries out my lips after it wears off. I happened to run out of my regular lip balm the day this came, and was trying to figure out what to use for the night. I thought what the heck, and threw it on. Holy cow, I love it! When I woke up, my lips were still hydrated, and I could feel the barest hint of the product still on. I've been wearing it all the time now, and normally my lips have a fit with most lip balms or glosses. I really hope they come out with a completely clear one, as I'd wear it everyday like a classic lip balm!",Rallie03,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
meh,"It was cute, but the sample was way too tiny and the gloss itself was too sticky at first. Overall the gloss is a cute colour and I didn‚Äôt mind it.",KarleighRock,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
love this balm!,"rare beauty can absolutely do no wrong! this is a fun lip balm/gloss to give your look a little spice. I got the nearly neutral color, and I love brown tones so this was perfect for my olive medium skin tone. I would say it‚Äôs definitely fun for a monochromatic look, but I love how the finish is basically a naturally plum, hydrated lip vibe. so good!",Saraa123,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Not just for the kids,"Tried this off a free sample at Sephora and I was surprised how nice it was. I'm fair with dark hair and 47, so too much gloss or too much pigment looks terrible on me. In the tube, the gloss looked much darker than it looks when applied, very sheer and not terribly glossy. Once it sets in, it just looks like you have a good moisturized lip, not like you are wearing makeup. Looks good even when the reat of my face is not made up.",luvfekkai,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
FULL GLOSSY LIPS,"I just tried this gloss for the first time and all I can say is wow!! The application was nice, it is not tacky, it‚Äôs such a beautiful gloss, and my lips look full!! I absolutely love the color and how my lips look. I wore this on top of of a rare beauty lipstick and loooove it!",doseofvitamins,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
I like very much this gloss,"This formula is not a traditional gloss formula so if you want shine without any goopyness try this one! It feels like balm with a plush feel when you rub your lips together. Nearly Neutral is a my lips but better shade that makes you look like you're hydrated and have a healthy sheen as opposed to looking like you have too much gloss on. Perfect for the winter months and not overly pigmented that you have to worry about it getting all over your mask, in fact it somewhat absorbs into the lips throughout the day. I am going to purchase this in more shades!",sweetpea377,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
I very much like this gloss,"I'm really loving the smooth texture and moisturizing feel of this gloss. It's hard for me to find a good lip gloss that's the right amount sheer and not incredibly sticky, and i feel like this one is just about perfect and it's likely to become a standard item in my makeup bag from now on. I'm glad i tried it.",hellFeather,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This glossy lip balm is so moisturizing and comfortable, yet so pigmented! It‚Äôs not sticky at all, and leaves my lips feeling soft and smooth. It has a normal wear time for a gloss, and definitely needs to be reapplied after eating or drinking, but I enjoy reapplying as it feels very nourishing.",amandarl7,17 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
The bomb!,"Amazing balm. The product is a cross between liquid lipstick and balm, applies easily, comfortable, great color payoff.",clasen,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Lovely everyday lip gloss,"This lip gloss in Nearly Apricot is perfect for a ""no-makeup"" look. It adds a nice amount of gloss and shine, with just a hint of color without feeling sticky. It is comfortable to wear and also feels hydrating on the lips. Super happy with this.",TintinNY,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Slightly confused because the models the gloss looks super pigmented ? This was almost no color at all? I got mauve and I had to put on three layers for any color. I‚Äôm not sure if I got a dud but will keep trying to mix it!,SavSav7,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Nourishing balm with prettiest hint of color!,"I found my new MLBB shade for my light/neutral skintone! This is a super comfortable balm that actually nourishes while giving lips the prettiest tint. There‚Äôs just a hint of glossiness, almost like lips are slightly wet, but not sticky at all. So so good!",EmiAUH,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
The lip balm I always needed!!,This is one of the best lip balms I have ever tried!! I love the formula because it leaves my lips feeling hydrated and has a natural looks to the lips. The color is so pretty and definitely unique. My lips do not feel sticky but feel so nice and I can wear this balm for my every day looks.,LismaniaBeauty,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
SO SMOOTH!,This product is awesome! I pad it with my rare beauty lipstick and it‚Äôs very pretty!! And SO smooth on my lips the applicator is flimsy which makes it easy to get every area of your mouth! Would recommend!,Marleyjs,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best balm ever!!!,"This balm is the best!This formula is so unique and perfection in everyway. I have used a lot of balms in my life, from high end to store brand and never have a ever been satisfied until I tried this. Feels so hydrating on the lips,super comfortable, keeps my lips feeling soft for hours, very natural looking, not sticky and absolutely love the packaging. Definitely getting more.",fabbeautyboss27,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,It was good to try. love Selena! but to be honest I won't be repurchasing this tho. No hate.,HeatherVBabe,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
A win for me!,"I got the Nearly Mauve shade and I‚Äôm so happy with how well it works with my skin tone! It‚Äôs pink but nice and subtle.

I LOVE the formula on this. It‚Äôs very hydrating and doesn‚Äôt feel like your typical sticky gloss. It‚Äôs thin and lightweight and really sinks into the lips to moisturize. Super comfortable, I would definitely buy another shade.",DanaE94,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Staying Power Even While Drinking!,"This lip gloss balm feels fantastically hydrating.  The color is lovely! I applied some and went about my afternoon. After I had sipped a whole cup of tea, I noticed that I didn't need to reapply.  I will definitely be buying more!",AmyL44,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
I want all the colors!,"I got a trial size of this in my last order (it's so tiny and cute lol) I will definitely be buying the full size, the sample isn't going to last long.. I can't stop reapplying it. I'm impressed with the amount of pigment you get plus it's not sticky AT ALL and very glossy, shiny and moisturizing. Rare Beauty is coming in strong with these new products, everything I've tried has fully impressed me",hillarynrealife,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I have the trial size for this because I wanted to see if I liked it before I get the actual size . Feels so smooth like butter when applying ! My boyfriend kissed me while I had it on and he was intrigued! Not sticky !,Eevee98,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
if I knew how good it was before trying,"I wouldn't have given away my second trial size. My boyfriend couldn't stop kissing me. And normally he hates when I wear lipgloss because it's sticky. This was the complete opposite. A complete game changer, I'm blown away.",RedBird203,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
The Best Gloss Balm,This gloss balm is literally the best! It‚Äôs so beautiful yet moisturizing and comfortable to wear. The color is absolutely stunning on the lips. Definitely will be buying more colors,eojacky,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Must have!,I live this gloss! It‚Äôs not to pigmented ! It‚Äôs very natural and it really moisturizes! An everyday gloss instead of my usually chapstick I feel this moisturizes more!,crtwod,16 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Most Innovative Balm / Gloss,"I have the Stay Vulnerable Glossy Lip Balm in the color Nearly Rose. This beautiful lip balm gloss hybrid blew me away. I have been a lip gloss and balm lover for ages. I have never tried a formula so unique as this one! The applicator is wand is different. It allows for precise application as it is not a typical sponge applicator. It almost rolls or glides on. The balm feels similar to a very popular lip mask, but wears beautifully like a light lip color. It is a sheer wash of color, but a bit thicker formula than a sheer gloss. It feels so comfortable and nourishing and is not at all sticky. I can‚Äôt wait to purchase more of these in additional colors. Also, the tube is flat on one side so it doesn‚Äôt roll off the table. Brilliant!",amygirl3540,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Beautiful,"I love how comfortable this is on my lips, it feels like a balm! It left my lips so smooth and it‚Äôs not sticky. It adds the perfect amount of color and leaves a beautiful shine. The packaging and the product are beautiful!",byjaque,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I love this color on my lips (applied on my bottom lip in the picture)! It provides a light natural color with a juicy glossy look. I agree that it feels like a balm - very moisturizing and non-sticky compared to lipgloss. I appreciate the sleek packaging and the teardrop applicator. I would definitely recommend this product, and want to try the other colors offered!",KSXxxx,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Beautifully formulated!,"This formula is so nourishing/hydrating and isn‚Äôt sticky at all. Surprisingly, the color isn‚Äôt outrageously bold either (phew)! It‚Äôs actually pretty close to my natural lip color so it‚Äôs very wearable. I can‚Äôt wait to try more shades!",Jennnyx3,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
A beautiful gloss,I LOVE this glossy lip balm! It is an all around beautiful product. It is just enough color to give a beautiful berry natural tint. It leaves your lips feeling smooth and hydrated without giving a sticky feeling like some lipglosses do.,mandymarie10,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,This is a great gloss. Formulated nice and non sticky! I love the flat side the tube has so it isn‚Äôt rolling all over my vanity. The color is pigmented but can be sheered out nicely. This collection is so cute!,desireenoel,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Nearly Neutral is a my lips but better shade in a good (but not mind-blowing) formulation. The shade is sheer enough that I can apply it without a mirror. The texture is a cross between a non-sticky gloss and a balm that feels moisturizing and relatively thin on the lips.,StephhLau,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Really moisturizing,"I really love these glossy lip balms. I have the shade nearly neutral, which is a sheer beigey rose shade. It is almost clear on my lips, but gives just a subtle hint of tint plus shine. I also find it's really moisturizing and soothing immediately after applying, and keeps my lips moisturized for several hours even after the shine is gone.",stephlifebeauty,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
So in muave!,This gloss balm is really beautiful! I love the berry color as it is very unique and muavey. The perfect kind of color for me that is not too bright or even too dark. I love how comfortable this is on my lips and just have shiny and soft they feel. Overall this is an amazing product that is good for anytime with enough wear time.,YesiiS,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Best formula!,"I absolutely love this Glossy Lip Balm! I‚Äôve been using it everyday since I got it! The formula feels so nice, super comfortable and I love the pigmentation too!

Looking forward to getting more shades, what a gorgeous collection!",cabazita,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
lightweight and luxurious,"This formula is magic. It feels like a nourishing, lightweight texture and it slightly plumps the lips.

It‚Äôs perfect for everyday, and I find myself using it more often than Fenton gloss bomb!",Reinaxo,15 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Feels so nice on the lips!,"Seriously! This balm feels so good on my lips! It is so pillowy! It gives a pretty flush of color and at the same time, it feels like a hydrating lip mask.

Such a beautiful gloss,This is such a gorgeous lip gloss! Im obsessed with the texture. Its not sticky at all and has a nice very small amount of pigment. Its like a wash of color on the lips. Its thick enough to make the lips feel moisturized and have that slight wash of color. This product is also slightly scented. Kinda smells like a fancy old lady with a splash of vanilla. In the best way possible. Highly recommend.,Candice215,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

It is the perfect shade for everyday wear, it does not feel sticky at all. I will be purchasing the full size for sure!",joycemendez,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Necessary? Nah. Nice? Absolutely!,"I am really enjoying using this liquid balm. The texture is very hydrating and just a tiny bit waxy so it stays on the lips really nicely, even when nowadays I‚Äôm simply wearing it under my mask for myself!

I chose the shade Nearly Mauve and I love the subtle deep tint it gives my lips. I‚Äôd love to try out other shades since I enjoy the formulation so much.

Overall, is it necessary? Nah. A nice treat? Totally!",sarebear315,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

Not super glossy/shiny,I love this lip gloss so much! The shade I got is so natural. It gives that your lips but better look. It's not super glossy but its enough. It also doesn't feel sticky at all. I'm not sure about the lip balm qualities though.,jezskin32,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I got this as a mini sample and was so impressed by how nonsticky, comfortable, and long lasting this glossy lip balm was.

,This lipgloss shade is such a beautiful color. I love the applicator and I love the shape of the tube as well. It‚Äôs a rounded tube but flat on one side so no rolling off the table! It‚Äôs lightweight and very pretty packaging!,Aman17,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Dark Skin Friendly!,"I love this gloss! It feels a little sticky on, but it's still smooth and leaves my lips feeling so moisturized afterwards. I wore it with a coffee brown lip liner and it looked even better! And to my dark skin people: YES! It's a nude for us too. I saw Andrea Renee's review on yt and it was definitely worth it. Not sure how it wears with a lipstick underneath, but with a plain balm it cooperates well. I can't wait to order the full size and more colors!",TashiiBeth,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Very comfortable,I was not expecting much when I added this gloss as a promo with my latest order. This has to be the most comfortable lip product that I have worn in recent memory. I wore this for 8 hours under a mask at work and when I took off my mask my lips were not dry. I have not been this excited about a product in a long time. I plan on purchasing additional colors.,Loretta55,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
SOOOO GOOOOOOOOD,"Got this as a sample with a $25 purchase. It‚Äôs FANTASTIC. It‚Äôs very similar to the fitglow lip serums which are my favourite, but this is half the price. Anddd it‚Äôs made in Canada! I would definitely reorder.",roksmysoks,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"obsessed, now I need every shade!","Im obsessed with this gloss, the shade is very subtle and it feels like your lip but better and juicier, the formula is great! its not sticky nor heavy and my hair doesn't get caught on it. Its a mix between a lip cream and gloss.",OhSoLaura,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
great product great price,"I‚Äôm so obsessed with this gloss. I‚Äôm also giving it away on my ig glou beauty along with other items in this collection. It doesn‚Äôt feel heavy at all, which I find is the case with a lot of other lip glosses (like tower28). It‚Äôs not super long lasting, nor is is super pigmented, so it kind of reminds me of a lip oil. However I like it so much more than other lip oils (kosas, ilia, lilah b) because it lasts longer and has a better feel overall. I haven‚Äôt found a gloss formula I like as much as chanel until now. I‚Äôm really happy they didn‚Äôt toss in any silicones into this formula because I was starting to associate rare beauty with super slippery formulas which I‚Äôm not always down for. Highly recommend!",karenleeza,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love this!,"This is literally the prettiest lip gloss! Love the colour and texture! Good for the price and I need to try more colours! Apparently it‚Äôs not sticky & very hydrating, comfortable to wear too, love the formula so much!!",kayxlotte,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
very silky,"Really wanted to try this. Got it with 25+ purchase. It‚Äôs great! Very similar to Huda Beauty silky balm, the same feeling on the lips but with a variety of colors. My concern was the the color (nearly neutral looks like thankful) and the smell/taste would be similar to the lip balm from the previous rare beauty collection (it was too strong and I can taste it, which is not great), but it‚Äôs not. While it smells the same (nice), you can‚Äôt taste it. And the color is very subtle and less mauve than thankful. Overall, makes me want to have the full size product.",OlaHola,14 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
My go to lip gloss,"I love the collection! It‚Äôs super cute and it‚Äôs literally all essentials. I love this lip gloss it is vegan and cruelty free so that‚Äôs definitely the requirements for me to wear something on my face. It does feel a little thick on your lips, this has never bothered me but i know it will bother some of you.",smariahm98,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Gorgeous Shine!,Love this brand and this gloss is just absolutely gorgeous! It‚Äôs high shine and you really only need a little bit. The color is absolute stunning (Nearly Apricot) just the right amount of pink! It smells like cake too!! The shine looks great and also helps to hydrate your lips all day long.,KimberlyTuck,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Good moisturizing gloss,"I really like this gloss because it‚Äôs super moisturizing like a lip balm, but has a glossy appearance(also not sticky at all). The color is very sheer & definitely isn‚Äôt as dark as it does in the tube, but with 2-3 coats you can see a very subtle wash of color. It‚Äôs a nice everyday gloss for a very natural look(what I personally like). I‚Äôd love to see Rare come out with glosses that are highly pigmented with the same feel as these.",curlym18,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Great,This is perfect! It‚Äôs like a balm and gloss combined. It is not sticky and I see myself using it a lot . So happy I got to try it. The color is really nice and The color is great for everyday use. Must try!,islandtoo,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
favorite!!,my favorite of the colors!! lovely!! I have two of the other shades (apricot and neutral) and am officially in love.  my lips are frequently dry and it's such a relief to finally have a lip gloss that doesn't dry me out!,iszie,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
yessssss,lovely!! I have two of the other shades (neutral and mauve) and am officially in love.  my lips are frequently dry and it's such a relief to finally have a lip gloss that doesn't dry me out! very balmy texture! and perfect amount of pigment,iszie,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
leaves my lips soft,lovely!! I have two of the other shades (apricot and mauve) and am officially in love.  my lips are frequently dry and it's such a relief to finally have a lip gloss that doesn't dry me out!,iszie,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
so soft and creamy,"I got this as a sample when you spend $25. I wanted to try it before I committed and I am sold. The color is very subtle and matches my exact lip color. I am more of a clear/nude lipgloss girl and this color did not disappoint. I was very shocked on how creamy this gloss is. Your lips feel so smooth. It‚Äôs a thin formula but it is very hydrating, not sticky at all. It feels like a glossy balm. It last about 3 hours on my lips before I felt like I had to reapply. I will be purchasing the full size.",Jessiee28,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I love the color and packaging of this lip gloss from Rare Beauty! I have the apricot color and it's really pretty. I like that these lip glosses aren't sticky and feel nourishing on my lips. I want to try more colors.,velvetreport,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
I‚Äôm loving it!,"This is such a wonderful gloss! The shade I got, nearly Berry, is perfect for my darker skin and the gloss feels really balmy rather than sticky. It hydrates my lips well over a lip liner and I‚Äôm really enjoying how natural it looks since I‚Äôm not doing full makeup looks nowadays.",khushi1899,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Lovely Gloss!,I love how this gloss feels on my lips. It has such a soft velvet feel to it and is not sticky at all. The gloss feels very hydrating and the shade compliments the natural color of my lips. I highly recommend this product and it really is the perfect hybrid of a balm and gloss!,kanga101,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Comfortable, and so gorgeous!","This is exactly as described! It‚Äôs the perfect hybrid between a gloss and a balm! It‚Äôs incredibly comfortable to wear and the color is absolutely stunning! It‚Äôs not sticky whatsoever, and there‚Äôs no bad scent!",fayepoe,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Enjoying the feel of this glossy lip balm, not sticky and feels hydrating. The color ‚Äònearly neutral‚Äô is the perfect shade and would look good on anyone.",dawnsmission,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I love the formula and how it is a liquid lip balm with a tint instead of a stickier gloss. The tube packaging is super unique and has a flat side so it won't roll off your vanity. The nearly mauve shade is not too different from my natural lip color and adds just a hint of color and some shine. Most importantly my lips are left SO HYDRATED!! I will definitely be purchasing other shades.,adramerah,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,What a great formula! It spreads really nicely but also feels really hydrating. It definitely has some pigment but it‚Äôs not over the top. It‚Äôs perfect for a quick little dab of color but won‚Äôt dry out my lips :),lauren233,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
So pretty!!,I looove this formula. I got the shade Nearly Mauve & it‚Äôs gorgeous. It‚Äôs a sheer glossy balm formula that leaves the right amount of color on your lips. It‚Äôs totally Perfect for day & night. This one is definitely staying in my purse!!,aprilmichelle82,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Hydrating n Glossy,"Im so excited to try out this beauty. What an beautiful packaging it has firstly. Im a big time gloss fan and if my gloss is non sticky then its a plus. This gloss is so hydrated and non sticky. Love how weightless, natural looking and glossy it is. Its left my lips smooth and soft. Love the applicator too which swipe on lips easily. I can see myself end up buying all shades soon I guess. Such a comfortable lip gloss which feels like a balm.",icecreamandlatt,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
SO PRETTY,Love love love this gloss! It is so hydrating like a balm and not sticky like other glosses! Must try!,Nissa2,13 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I really love this gloss. It feels like a hydrated cushion and it isn‚Äôt sticky, and it isn‚Äôt so light that it feels like it will wipe off easily. I chose Nearly Apricot for a hint of color but I hardly see any color with this gloss. I will most likely purchase a deeper shade. Overall, I recommend this gloss!",amarie7,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"This really hydrates like a balm, but shines like a gloss! I love how weighless, nourishing & how it doesn't feel sticky. It provides just enough natural color to your lips & I can see myself wearing this on a daily basis!",darcie48,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Looks like a gloss, feels like a balm","The color is discreet, not sticky... i really recommend it",lylicorne,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Must Try,This has got to be my favourite lip gloss. I love how the colour is very light yet still there. It‚Äôs also not sticky which I find a lot of lip glosses are. I love these lip glosses I definitely will buy more shades.,GeriBear135,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
So pretty,Gorgeous gloss that pairs perfectly with the rest of the nearly neutral collection. Has great coverage and isnt overly sticky. No overpowering scent either which is important to me due to migraines. Would recommend.,kaitlinr14,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,Super hydrating on the lips. Love the color! Will be purchasing more from this collection. Not much of a lip gloss girl and I must say I really enjoy putting this on.,itsslizzzie3,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
"Amazing formula, 10/10 would recommend!","Amazing formula! I tought this product would be closer to a lipgloss texture, but it's actually a lip balm texture with a slight tint. I have very dry lips and most lip balm are only okay to me. But for some reason, this left my lips so soft and smooth! I can't believe it.",JadeR95,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"I am always searching for the perfect Mauve shade and this Rare Beauty lip gloss definitely hits the mark.  I already had the Nearly Neutral I had picked up in a special Rouge presale, but it was not nearly as beautiful as this gorgeous Mauve.  I love that the glosses are not sticky.  Beautiful comfortable formula.",,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,This gloss is so comfy on your lips! Just feels like a lip balm with a hint of colour it‚Äôs soooo pretty!,Floune123,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Ended up loving it!,I‚Äôm a huge lip balm fan so I was excited to try this product! At first I was a little thrown off by the packaging. It has one completely flat side. Upon thinking about and this brand I wondered if it was so it was easier to open. I did find with the flat side it was a lot easier to open then your typical tube. The wand applicator threw me off as well because it has a tapered point all around but it was very easy to apply to the lips while the lips were closed. It took literally 5 seconds to apply the balm flawlessly. It does feel like your typical balm without any sticky feeling. It gives a sheer wash of color (I have Nearly Mauve) to the lips that is very flattering (especially right now when we can‚Äôt exactly wear lipsticks). It leaves your lips very soft and cushiony. I‚Äôm a fan!,MalloryElaine,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Great gloss!,I absolutely am loving this gloss so far! It is not sticky and lasts a good period of time before having to reapply! Would definitely like to try some other shades. I also love the color payoff and that it‚Äôs just the right amount.,songwatson17,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,"Tried a sample of this and I LOVE the formula! Nearly Neutral is definitely a ""your lips but better"" shade. It feels exactly like a lip balm both in terms of texture and hydration. I don't expect it to last too long, but definitely a great everyday and could probably layer over dryer mattes.",KathJ8,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Hydration and Shine,"The name ""Glossy Lip Balm"" describes this product perfectly. It is a non-sticky, conditioning lipgloss that adds shine and hydration. These are not meant to be pigmented and appear darker in the tube than they would on the lips. Nearly Mauve appears as a deep rose in the tube, but applies like a very sheer, wash of berry tint on the lips.",BEAUTYTALK27,12 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
10/10 would recommend,"I love how beautiful the packaging and the actual product is! For the cost, it is quite high value. This is more sheer than I expected but it gives a beautiful glow/ glossy feel to your lip! It only lasts for a few hours, but it‚Äôs expected of a gloss product! Overall I would really recommend this lip gloss above others due to its high quality and value",chauwie,11 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,This lipgloss is amazing! I feel that it is super lightweight and it doesn‚Äôt accentuate any fine lines in the lips. It also helps with making them feel hydrated. The color you see isn‚Äôt as much as it comes out to be. The color berry isn‚Äôt as dark as I thought it would be. It gives a nice wash of color which I personally really enjoy because it allows me to use it with different eye looks.,itsaislingduh,11 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Must try,"The packaging is beyond gorgeous I especially love the color I chose ‚Äúnearly rose‚Äù it feels so smooth and not too dry, also feel like it‚Äôs really long lasting I barely had to touched up through the day",shadesofNatalee,11 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Big fan of this gloss!,First of all I think the packaging is so unique. I love that there's a flat side so it won't roll on my table. I'm also glad to find a gloss that is not sticky nor heavy on the lips. It gives a nice hint of color and I just find it so nourishing. I think they made the right choice to put a thinner applicator. It just gives you the right amount of product and it gives you a lot of control when applying it your lips. I think it's one of the best lip gloss in the market right now.,zCrish,11 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
,I bought this in the mauve and the nude the application is great! Just the texture throws me off it looks like it would be a gloss but feels like a lip balm. It doesn‚Äôt last long but it‚Äôs so comfortable on the lips and has NO taste huge win!!!,pink1cupcakes,11 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
New holy grail lip formula!,"This is the perfect subtle lip product, and I can‚Äôt wait to try more shades. It feels like a nourishing balm, somewhat similar to Huda‚Äôs Silk Balm or the Lanc√¥me Labsolu Lacquer, and adds the perfect flush of color. Definitely going to repurchase when I finish!",TayloredBeauty0,11 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
A beautiful lipbalm,"This is my second time trying anything from Rare Beauty asides from the liquid eyeshadow.  The glossy lip balm shade I got was nearly rose flushed pink. The color is so gorgeous as well and my lips are soft, plumped and hydrated.",hellokittyskin,11 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing for the price,"Really great lip gloss! I've taken one star off because the longevity is poor compared to other lip glosses, but the feel is really nice, definitely not sticky, and the colour is beautiful, more than sheer but less than super pigmented. Especially for the price point, I would buy another colour!",lipsticklover01,11 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Love this shade and how it feels on my lips,"I'm in love with this shade! It's a perfect nude color for me, it looks like my lips but better.
The formula is weightless, very nourishing, not sticky at all. It feels like a balm, it hydrates my lips, filling in the cracks (oh I need it so much this winter!).",elisbliss,10 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Super comfortable,"These are thick but in a good way, hydrating and add the perfect amount of shine to your lips. I got 2 colors and both are sheer. I do have semi darker lips so someone with light lips might get a bit more color pay off. Though they are balms so of course not much pigment is expected. These replaced other lip balms/lip glosses I used.",JayCore,9 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes
Amazing!,"I love it! The color is subtle, which is what I wanted. It‚Äôs not sticky!",AmelieFontaine,9 Jan 2021,RareBeauty,Lip,Yes

In love!,"already received it! and loooved it! when you see it on the lips it looks just like a gloss but in the feeling it's actually so different, like so soft and cushioning on the lips!
