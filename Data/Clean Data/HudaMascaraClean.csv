Amazing. I bought this on a trip bc the mascara I brought with me dried out and it made my lashes look insanely long and voluminous. So gorgeous with just one or two layers.,03 Feb 2025,,Sara2486,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"Very nice product, looks beautiful but very small amount for a full size product at full.price. The tube is deceiving because it looks big, but most of it is the brush. Just wish there was a little more product for the price.",02 Feb 2025,"Nice, but small",DanceMom4Lyfe,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I wasn't as thrilled with the mascara as I wanted to be. On my lashes I didn't find one end did more than the other and using both together as suggested left my eyelashes feeling clumpy. The mascara is expensive too and I purchased the mini size. If I'm going to shell out over $20 for mascara I'll do it for another brand.,30 Jan 2025,Not my favorite mascara,CallmePrissy,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"Honestly I just got this cuz I saw it on TikTok and decided to see what was so special about it but after trying it. It‚Äôs just a mid mascara, it‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs just not worth the 25$ since I could‚Äôve gotten a way bigger one for less than this price and it‚Äôs also so tiny.   price",29 Jan 2025,Mascara,Glamera,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

It has been my go-to mascara for a night out for YEARS. No matter what side you use it is perfect. It might not be your cup of tea if you want it to be more natural or like barely there because it can clump but not that badly. I love the thickness and darkness it gives. the only thing I don‚Äôt love is that it kind of gives raccoon eyes by the end of the night.,22 Dec 2024,Perfect glamour and bombshell mascara!,zoebbb,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I'm on my second purchase of Hudson Beauty Legit Lashes and I absolutely love it! This mascara definitely extends my lashes and gives them incredible volume. However, I have noticed that it tends to transfer a lot onto the top of my brow where my lashes touch and also on my under eye area. Despite this, I keep coming back to it because the length and volume it provides are unmatched.

"This is a horrible mascara, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because of my constant wear or makeup removal but this mascara has my litt√©ral eyelashes falling out.

I am very much a mascara girly and this one here checks all the boxes. It is buildable which is great. It gives false lash vibes without the cost and commitment.

"For everyone writing a review on the little sample packet- don‚Äôt you dare not give this mascara the stars it deserves! Sorry your packet dried out- but the REAL mascara that you‚Äôre reviewing is outstanding. 

The curl & length side literally does exactly that! It is a true, separating mascara that lengthens and separates. I have long but sparse lashes that love to clump and curl & length side is the holy grail. 

Then, when you need volume (like me!!) the volume side maintains the separation from the Curl & length side, but plumps sooo well. I pair it with other mascaras when I'm in a pinch to add fullness! My lashes look like falsies when I layer with both! I try to save the awesomeness for special occasions but I always wind up going to it for the daily look!!",16 Mar 2024,Ignore the ‚Äúsample‚Äù reviews!!,Chandler925,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

The product itself is not bad but the duel brushes are way to short. I always end up poking myself in the eye when trying to get the brush to my lashes.

"It's amazing how personal mascara is and the reviews are so wildly different. This is my 2nd time buying this mascara. It's the only one that gives me a false lash look and a curl that lasts plus it's not hard to remove at the end of the day. I have never had any smudging or flaking like some have noted but I can understand that being different from person to person. I love how the lashes clump together to give a doll eye look and I'm thinking that might be attributed to the small lash like fibers from the lengthening side. The value is also great even for the mini version. For comparison, the other mascaras that I enjoy are the Charlotte Tilbury push up lashes, Dior pump n show, cheekbone (Canadian brand), and for drug store I like the L'Oreal lash paradise.

I first curl my lashes the base. Two pumps and then release the curler. I don't curl again mid-lash. I first use the volume side, getting as close to the upper lash line as possible.

I have bought a full size mascara after testing the tiny sample and I get disappointed. That being said, I have the mini LEGIT LASHES and the bigger (wand) side works amazing. I try to not do my eye liner too thick or else the magic of the long lashes disappears. I mostly use the wird-thick side which is quite different to what I have seen in the past. The other side is nothing extraordinary- just the typical pharmacy brand wand. At first I did not give this enough credit and I realized I should start being more conservative while doing my cat-eye so that I can actually see the long lashes I achieve with this.

"I agree with ""SKIP IT!""
Both ends of the wand are terrible. The formula of the mascara is too thick and clumpy so it basically buries the bristles on the wand and makes it impossible to lift and separate your lashes to get an even coat. It results in a clumpy, dense look, and also makes it difficult to do the bottom lashes without making a mess. This product is a complete MISS.",12 May 2022,Bad Product,Shanaj1967,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I genuinely don't think I've ever used a mascara worse than this one. it smudged down my eyes within a couple of hours. I never have an issue with mascara smudging on me. it wasn't hot out. I didn't cry. Nothing out of the ordinary should have caused this to smudge and this was my very first time trying it. not to mention it did NOT hold curl and it left my lashes looking clumpy and uneven.

False lashes annoy me when wearing so I don't which is why I'm thankful I found this hidden gem. I don't even need to use both sides to give me a long an full lash effect.

Third and final, and the worst part - every time I removed this mascara I would lose my eyelashes. I was using a gentle cleanser and I noticed it would be lashes on lashes falling out.

"If you had extension lashes and want your natural lashes to still look dramatic, this will give that effect. It does create a big lash look, however it's super drying.

"I am a mascara lover, and this is the best I have tried. I usually do love layering multiple mascaras because even with no other makeup, I think good eyelashes can really help you look awake. I don‚Äôt know how to apply false lashes and I really don‚Äôt like how heavy they can look, so I use 3 mascaras to get some length and volume. With this being double sided, I really don‚Äôt need to use another product at all; it‚Äôs doing the work of 3 with the two! I thought Too Faced Better Than Sex was good, but this is way better than Better Than Sex! Incredible. I also have oily skin/eyelids and sometimes my mascara gets into my eyes causing irritation after a full day of wear, but this did not move. I bought the mini size for on the go when I don‚Äôt have time in the morning to put my typical work face on, and this delivers.

I'm not super stoked about this mascara so I'm glad I only bought the mini size.
I like the idea of having 2 different wand sizes/shapes to curl or lengthen but I have one mascara that did both with one wand and did it better.
I also wasn't a fan of how flexible the wand was. I just didn't feel super comfortable using it with my arthritic hands.

The second downside is throughout the day, small pieces of the mascara separates, leaves the eyes and actually winds up in the eye which also causes eye irritation and burning. For these 2 reason I would never purchase it. 
FYI I use the same eye make up remover for all my other mascara but never had this issue in the past.",8 Jan 2022,"Gives volume and length, but suspicious quality",GhazalehEA,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I didn‚Äôt but this from Sephora. It was included in an Ipsy box. I wanted to love it because in theory it‚Äôs seems like a great idea but it was impossible to even like it. Each wand is so short it‚Äôs impossible to do a great job on the inner corners and the wands kept hitting my nose so it left streaks of product on my nose and my eyebrows.

I can honestly say after years of searching for the best mascara I have finally found my absolute favourite mascara! The lengthening wand is the perfect size to grab those little lashes at the outer corner. The lengthening also had tiny fibers that elongated my lashes. The volumizing made my lashes so thick and fluffy without looking clumpy. Some of the reviews mention flaking/ smudging but I haven‚Äôt experienced either of those. Definitely worth a try.,6 Jan 2022,Amazing!,cat345,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

It's just ok. I followed the instructions exactly and yes, my lashes looked really good. But they didn't look $27 good. I then used each individual wand, one on each eye, and ended up with the same results as when I used them together. No difference. Ok fine, at least it works good either way. Fast forward 2 weeks and, even tho I only use it once a day, the tube is already drying out and then flaking off my lashes. I ended up returning it bcz it just wasn't worth it.

"I have used, over the last few years, many different mascaras - from Tom Ford and Fenty to Smashbox and Lanc√¥me - and all came up wanting at the end of a long day.  I received a sample of this mascara and was intrigued enough to purchase the real deal. And I was right to do so. This mascara goes on easily - no clumping - and the two ends make my short, full lashes look beautiful. And best of all - drumroll please - it doesn‚Äôt flake, transfer, or smudge throughout a full 10 hour day. I am a 50+ woman so this is very important to me; many mascaras go on looking nice but by the end of the day most mascara has either left little black flakes under my eyes (NOT CUTE!) or smudged or transferred to the upper part of my hooded eyelid. This mascara doesn‚Äôt do that AT ALL. To the point where it can be a little hard to take off - I have to use a makeup remover on a cotton pad and let it soak off much of the mascara and then go to my regular face cleaning regime to get the remnants off.  But I‚Äôll take the extra time and care because this mascara is just so good!  I definitely recommend.",1 Jan 2022,This mascara is definitely legit!,alwaysoptimistic,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I was testing out this product for a few day until I got late one morning and I thought : I need something that can do it quickly. And this is when I realize.. this mascara is not the most convenient. You have to pull out from the 2 side relatively quickly enough to have the result that 1 mascara can give it to you.

"It has been a long time since I‚Äôve come across a good mascara I can rave about. I first tried this when I selected it as a sample, lost the packaging & had to do some detective work to figure out what brand it was & who sold it. It was totally worth the trouble. I love having full, long lashes, so doing two steps with the two unique brushes is a pleasure for me. I often use a lash primer & this mascara works well with or without it. The straight brush is used first & for me it lifts & separates my lashes coating them with just enough mascara. It‚Äôs easy to know when to stop & move on to the curling brush which adds volume. I don‚Äôt need any curl, so I‚Äôm careful not to push or pull with too much pressure & get just the right amount of tilt to my lashes with a full, long lash. As mentioned elsewhere, this mascara does not flake, but the tips of my lashes do hit my brow bone after applying this mascara as it makes them long & can leave a dark smudge. It helps if I use a matte eye shadow or light setting powder on my brow bone to absorb any oils that emerge through the day to attract such smudging.

"It‚Äôs a good mascara. I really enjoyed the curl and length side over the volumizing side, because I have long straight lashes.

I think any mascara would clump, this isn‚Äôt the only one.

"I wanted to love this mascara but unfortunately it was a huge let down to me. It dried clumpy and frequently the clumps fall down to my cheeks (leaving black marks on my face) and into my eyes (I wear contacts so it‚Äôs quite annoying). The formula also takes a long time to dry, the mascara loads on to the brush where I have to take excess off, and the wand just didn‚Äôt do much to shape my lashes. Everyone is different, but for me this mascara didn‚Äôt work.",28 Jun 2021,Not great,ORGraceGilarde,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"It is not a bad mascara, but I have used better. If you have thin small lashes this mascara is perfect for you. My lashes are quite long and many, this mascara causes them to clump together. The tiny hairs on the curl end are quite evident, and it is sort of a hassle to use two different ends. I like the benefit superfan mascara, it is cheaper and does a better job for my lashes. For me personally that mascara is still my go to!",25 Jun 2021,It's alright,Maya786,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I received this mascara as a free sample. I used the lengthening side first and I saw a difference. My lashes seemed longer without them looking over clumpy. Then I used the volume to really top it off which I loved the brush because it really helped with volume. This mascara gives more of a natural look. The only down about this mascara is that it does flake. I had to clean up my eye after a few hourS to avoid looking like a raccoon. Also by the end of the day the mascara seems to just dissolve. So I liked it as a sample but I don‚Äôt know if I would buy full size.,25 Jun 2021,,foxyroxy17,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

The issue I have with this product is it‚Äôs really chunky and I have naturally long eye lashes and this made them stick together and looked awful. The only way I can explain in it is fly legs (lol!) the brush is really thick so it makes it hard to apply and no matter what I did to not apply so much product it still applied on so chunky.

"This is a great mascara and I really wanted to give it 5/5 stars. The pigment is incredible‚Äîextremely dark. The curling formula is my favorite of the two. Definitely helps hold a curl even on my stick straight lashes. It lifts and separates well. The volume side is nice, but does tend ti clump my lashes together. Combing it out with a lash comb or blinking off the excess with a tissue helps. Only con from this great product is that it does not last in humid weather.

"I more so love the lengthening side. This mascara makes my lashes insanely dark and long. Probably the best I've ever used in terms of making them look like I'm wearing fake lashes. I also find the formula doesn't flake or smudge, and removes fairly easily. The lengthening side has little fibers that you can see on the wand, but on your lashes you don't see them. It builds really nicely and the curved wand helps get close to the corners of your lashes. I can wear 2-3 coats of this without it getting clumpy. The volumizing wand is a little tricky to work with and can hurt if you get it too close to your lash line. I think Huda could come out with just the lengthening side and it would still be a great mascara. I normally apply one coat of the volumizing side, then a coat or two of the lengthening, OR I just do 2-3 coats of the lengthening side. I like that it's a versatile product.

"This mascara is incredible. My usual go-to is Monsieur Big (before discovering that, I used Dior Blackout), but the volume pay off on this is much better, surprisingly. I already have long lashes (they are just thin) so was not a fan of the double ended packaging, it was wasteful for me. Would prefer to have the mascara's as two separate formulas and you can choose which you prefer/need. Having said that, when I tried the lengthening side, HOLY SMOKES does it deliver! So many people have asked me where I got my lashes done, and I have to explain that I don't wear extensions, it's just this mascara! Of note, I do use the Lancome Cils booster as a base and it really makes that extra difference. 

Also, although I don't like the double ended formula, I do like the packaging shape overall. At first I thought it would be bulky and difficult to manipulate, but all the edges allow you to get a good grip on it and feels oddly comfortable in your hand as you apply. 

This product only lost a star for the double-ended packaging, and the fact that it is not as long-lasting as I hoped. By late afternoon it has already started to flake and disappear.

"When first applying this mascara I was in love, the lengthening brush reminds me of telescopic my go to mascara of 15 years. It's a great mascara to mix up looks and for people with good eye lashes you really only need the lengthening side and at night throw a top coat of the volumizing side. The reason for three stars despite the wands is that the formula flakes off and if you try to get the flakes off you're left with black streaks under your eyes. So I now use it on dry days or when I'm doing things where I can check under my eyes often (aka lately sitting on my couch working).

I applied it as suggested first by using the volumizing side. I then followed it with the curl and lenghting side. I was very delighted with the results. I did not expect a false lash result because my lashes are small to begin with. However, I did get volume which is the most important for me, and a large amount of lenght.

"My go-to mascara has always been L‚ÄôOr√©al telescopic because of the brush. Ever since I received this mascara I have been obsessed!!! The design is amazing and convenient.

"I was very surprised by this mascara. It does what it says, in the fact it gives you the impression of wearing falsies. I never wore fake lashes, but I guess I won't have too! Couple of gripes though. 1) After 2 coats, it gets a bit clumpy.

Got this as a gift for review and I honestly didn‚Äôt think I was going to see a huge difference but I did and I am very please. The mascara is super black. It gave me  length and volume for my baby thin and short lashes.

I have long lashes so its hard to find mascara that doesn't make them look clumpy or dried out. I also find that most mascaras weigh down my lashes as well. The Huda Beauty Legit Lashes is actually pretty good! I love the the lengthening side because it gives my lashes a boost without having to use a curler. I will say that I can only use one side a time because it does tend to get clumpy with more than two coats. Another thing I like is that it doesn't shed or make my eyes itchy.

This is my first time trying Huda‚Äôs Double Ended mascara! I personally have sparse thin lashes! My lashes just grow straight! I wanted to test this mascara without curling my lashes like I usually do with any other mascara and man I was surprised. I was shocked when the volume and curling ends gave my lashes the lift I needed. Being the fact that this is without curling my lashes!

"This has been my go-to mascara pretty much since quarantine started. Why bother with falsies when I‚Äôve finally found a mascara that makes my natural lashes reach for my eyebrows?! It‚Äôs a true black which I loveeee in a mascara. For my top lashes, I use the volume side and then the curl & length side for a fuller effect. On my bottom lashes, I tend to gravitate to the volume side to define them a little bit more. It can get a little clumpy some times but I‚Äôm still giving 5 stars cause I‚Äôve noticed it only happens if I brushing in the middle of my lash instead of starting at the root... thats a learning curve but I don‚Äôt mind it now that I‚Äôve realized the problem was my own doing.

"I'm really picky with mascara, but I¬†LOVED this product.
I have thin lashes. A great mascara for me depends on the mascara wand. Volume side is soft and the pointed tip makes it useful for the baby lashes that are always difficult to grab. Curl side gives definition and curl without forming clumps on lashes. 
I used the volumizing side first starting from base of the eyelashes and then combed curl & length side lifting up the lashes few times and outcome is absolutely amazing! 
Formula was easy to work with and layered well. This mascara is not waterproof but It didn‚Äôt smudge or flake throughout the day and didn‚Äôt give my lashes that heavy feeling that some do, and overall product is bit bulky but that too because of the dual side!
Wear test- 9+ hours 
Packaging- A bit bulky

"I really liked the concept of having a dual-ended mascara for different looks. I found the volume brush was a bit hard to coat every lash, but the curved brush was amazing and coated every lash.

I‚Äôve been searching for a mascara to give me that bold and long lash look and this product does it. I find that this mascara doesn‚Äôt look clumpy and really adds lengths to your lashes.

"Below is my before and after and honestly it speaks for itself. This is seriously the best mascara that I have ever used. First I did 1 coat with the curl + length side and then 1 coat with the volume side together the results in the photo. It literally took me 30 seconds to apply it, so it was extremely easy and effortless. Sometimes with other mascara I have to work to get the mascara to even do anything but this is the complete opposite. My main issue with alot of mascaras is that it clumps my lashes and they look like spider legs,, well I was very pleased to find out this does not do that to me. My mother saw my lashes right after this photo and she ordered the legit mascara immediately lol. I was a religious user of Benefit Roller Lash but the curl + length side has a similar wand to that one and a better formula, so I have now stitched to Legit lashes. I love that there are 2 sides which are 2 different formulas that I like to use together or separate. Yes this mascara may be alittle more expensive then others but you have to remember you are getting 2 mascaras in 1.

And when I use the curl and length, my lashes just extend beautifully and curl without using an eyelash curler.

"I received the Legit Lashes from Huda Beauty free to review and now I'm a devotee. This mascara has two sides, a Curling/Lengthening side, and a Volumizing side. I'll be honest, by themselves, they are pretty standard lengthening and volumizing mascaras. They do exactly what they say they will. But when you put them together? That's when the magic happens. Together the two sides create long, luscious lashes that are a serious knockout. This formula is black as night and it's staying power is formidable. For a product that is not actually marketed as waterproof, this stuff STAYS PUT. The first time I used this I watched a sad show and bawled my eyes out and saw a bunch of mascara coming off my eyes and thought by the end of it my lashes would be naked. No. They were not naked. In fact, they looked like I hadn't cried my eyes out. It's magic. Even more impressive is the fact that these are fiber mascaras and they NEVER make my lashes look insane. These lay the smoothest of any fiber mascara I've ever used, and I was very concerned that this would be a problem. I also love that Huda Beauty is a cruelty free brand, which is very important to me. Overall, I would say that this mascara is incredibly impressive and I have a new favorite in my makeup bag!",8 Jan 2021,Really Impressive,kmair,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"This mascara worked a lot better than I originally thought it would. Although the main point is to use both sides on your lashes, you can definitely use only one and still get good results. In terms of length, both sides gave me about the same but the Length & Curl side stayed curlier than the Volume side when worn alone. If you‚Äôre looking to wear this on your bottom lashes, I recommend the Length & Curl side because the brush is thinner and the formula feels more lightweight.

"I can see why so many people rave about this mascara. I first used the lengthen and curl side, the formula is the dryer type with a long silicone brush that really gets every lash well and coats it well. The length was immediately noticeable while the tips did seem to curl upwards slightly. Then once that side set I used the volume mascara, it has a more of a wet formula with an applicator that goes from skinny to fat. As soon as I applied the volume mascara you could really see my lashes fatten up. I love how black this mascara and that when you apply it to your lashes it is almost weightless and doesn't leave them feeling crunchy. The only reason i took one star off is because I went in with a curler lightly after. the mascara was completely dry and that seemed to break it down a bit and start to make it flake ever so slightly, so as long as you don't do that you shouldn't have any flakiness issues.",8 Jan 2021,A good product,hescreamed,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

When I tried the mascara I felt that it was ideal  for my top  lashes but not bottom. I felt that with the curve side i didn‚Äôt like to use for bottom and the volume the brush was bigger than I liked. It applied fine but it was smudging the first two times. I tried it again and it was a lot better but it‚Äôs not my on the go mascara. I need to make sure I use when I have more time. Overall I say like a 3.5 but it won‚Äôt let me do that here.

"The mascara is quite beautiful. The packaging is also beautiful. I love the fact that you have two different formulas abs brushes. The curling and lengthening mascara is great. It looks natural and beautiful and think on its own, it would be excellent. The downfall is the plastic wand- is very stiff and hard. The volumizing mascara, though, isn‚Äôt great. It does give volume, but definitely shouldn‚Äôt be used on its own and is actually horrible. The brush is awful, as well. Maybe a different want would be better with thr volumizing. I applied directly as it said to- use the volumizing side, then follow up with the lengthening and curling side. It was a very wet formula and messy, as well. Maybe I just had higher hopes for this product and need more practice with it, but it wasn‚Äôt my favorite mascara, however, it also wasn‚Äôt the worst mascara. I will continue to use it and try to perfect it, and probably only use the curling and lengthening side. I feel like if this is going to be layered, it should be done so by using the lengthening side first, and volumizing side, second. It really is a beautiful mascara, though. Very black and very sultry.",7 Jan 2021,Mixed emotions,rebaroo1025,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I‚Äôm obsessed! Never figured out how to apply false lashes correctly so this mascara is IT for me! Love how wispy and full my lashes look!

"I‚Äôve got stick straight, short asian lashes so mascara is a really important part of my makeup routine. My ride or die has been the Tom Ford Badass Mascara but it‚Äôs SO expensive so i‚Äôve always been on the hunt for an affordable alternative and this is definitely my new fave mascara. The Huda Legit Lashes produces the same high impact effect when you use both the volume and lengthening/curling sides - high impact and maintains curl. What‚Äôs more, it doesn‚Äôt smudge on my oily lids even if I wear it all day which a lot of mascaras can‚Äôt do. It‚Äôs a definite winner and i‚Äôll continue to use this mascara since it‚Äôs also well priced :)",7 Jan 2021,Great mascara!,roo529,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

The packaging, the formula, the brush, THE STAYING POWER, the way it just lengthens and volumizes the top and bottom lashes.My lashes never looked so beautiful. They look longer and thicker when wearing this mascara.
I've used well over 15 different mascaras and this by far is the best. I've never had a mascara give me such LONG, FULL, VOLUMINOUS lashes.

"I really like this mascara! It definitely made my lashes look super full and long. I love how black it is, too, because I love when my lashes are dark. I use the curl and length side after I use the volume side, and I definitely noticed a difference as opposed to using the volume side alone.

When you flip over to volumize, thats when things get crazy. I was worried about the volumize side looking clumpy so I applied very conscientiously. Its really is great. The only downside is that if you applied the volumizer in a hurry or without attention, it would get clumpy. Since the products are separate though, in a hurry you could just use the lengthen side.

"I‚Äôm a mascara fiend and I love volumizing formulas like Diorshow, Milk Kush, and Tom Ford Badass Extreme. I received a sample of this with my Sephora order and did one coat of the volume formula. I hated it because it didn't seem to do anything. But as the sample size is generous, I played around with it and noticed that when you put on several coats, it does something magical. Unlike most mascaras, it doesn't clump and become overloaded. As it turns out, the trick is in the brush. Huda's brush has a million grooves and each time you apply a new coat, a new eyelash becomes defined. Most mascaras just goop product onto the prominent eyelashes, leaving the others bare and the overall look lacking. The final effect with this mascara is that all lashes become individually coated and dramatically defined. The volume brush is even tapered to give you more length at the ends, just like falsies. The final effect is full and exaggerated. You can pick and choose which eyelashes to exaggerate. The best way for me to describe it is that it looks like an Instagram filter. I've attached photos of my eyes with the volume formula, eyeliner, no lash primer and no filter. The length formula is good too but as I have long lashes, I don't need to use it all that much. This is one of the top mascaras, imho. Also the price is decent compared to other high-end brands.",1 Jan 2021,Several layers give you fluttery lashes,nyfashionista,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"Loved this mascara! It didn‚Äôt flake, didn‚Äôt smear, was dark and dramatic, just the way I like my lashes. If you have short lashes, it will definitely make them appear longer.

"The volumizing and lengthening power of this mascara is unbelievable! The concept of having two formulas in one is just genius and it makes the $$ worth it!

The color and stay power are amazing but for everyday use this mascara is very damaging and drying to the lashes. It functions like a waterproof mascara and I‚Äôve tried all of the make up removers on the market but this mascara is like concrete. Even the clean genie doesn‚Äôt get it off. I even tried to use a primer under it but that didn‚Äôt work either. I gave it 3 stars Bc the fibers are very painful if they get into your eye and the flakes feel like glass shards in your eyes. It‚Äôs amazing if you use it for a night out but not for everyday use. It will damage your lashes and make your eyes uncomfortable all day. They need to come up with a make up remover that actually melts it off. I really wanted to love this mascara and have gone through so many tubes trying to give this mascara a change but it‚Äôs physically painful and tedious to take off at the end of the day.,28 Dec 2020,fibers feel like glass shards,hunnybunny91,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

A single swipe of length & curl side  transforms my average length lashes into ones that look like extensions. My search for world best mascara is ended now . Must have mascara literally & price is reasonable too . Just give it a try once & yes it stay all day .

"I have tried soooo many mascaras. From drug store to high end and like this mascara I have never ever seen. Super quick results. As soon and I put the wand to my lashes it gives them that volume without any clumsiness. As Huda recommended, use the volume side first, then the curl and length.

"This is by far my favorite mascara & I really feel like it is worth the money! While I did receive this product as a sample, I already purchased this product with my own money prior for my friends and I! I know a lot of reviews have called this product out for being too clumpy, but I didn't have that experience. A little product goes along way!       I personally love the volume side! I don't have really long lashes to begin with and this does the trick. I always get asked if I'm wearing fake lashes!! The curl side is nice as well; less volume but more shaping! I would definitely recommend purchasing this!

Suggested Usage:
-One swipe for major volume: Combing from the base of your lashes to the end, apply the ""Volume"" side first. 
-Coat your bottom lashes with ""Curl & Length"" for a natural and fluttery look. 
-Together the most legit lashes: For best results, apply both layers before the product dries on your lashes.",16 Dec 2020,Love Legit Lashes!!!!,AprilG9,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"Wow, I think I‚Äôm in love. My lashes are long and black, so I wasn‚Äôt looking for a lot of volume or length from this mascara. My issue is that my lashes are naturally pin-straight, and usually can‚Äôt hold a curl for more than 2/3 hours. This mascara was a game changer for me, my lashes were actually lifted all day (which never happens!!!). Usually, I have to unstick the outer corner lashes from each other periodically throughout the day because they get tangled. Didn‚Äôt happen once for me.

The worst part was how easily it smudged under my eyes within an hour of wearing it, it also smudged all over my upper eyelid, which I‚Äôve never really experienced before with most mascaras.

Dark black color. I do get max volume, full looking lashes and length just using the volume side of brush. Adding the lengthening side, even longer lashes! Lasts, no problem on top lashes.

The ""volume"" side provided little to no volume and the other side gave slight lengthening effects but absolutely no curling effects.

* Water-proof/sweat-proof/cry-proof - Big no = 3/10.
* Smudging - 4/10. You can't touch much or it flakes and smudges.  This will melt/sweat off in the heat.
* Flakes - 5/10. Tiny black flakes under my eyes after 3 hours, no big flakes.
* Easy to remove: No! - 3/10.   Melts off slowly with soap and water and has an oily texture that smears.  It requires several steps to remove.
* Sensitivity - 4/10.  After a few hours my eyes itched and I wanted to tug at my lashes to itch them.

Pros- no issues with sensitive eyes and does give volume and curl. Cons- weights down lashes and transfers to under eyes after 3-4 hours. I wanted to like this mascara but find that wander beauty gives better results without the cons.,11 Aug 2020,,gnocchibee,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"This mascara does what it claims to do. I have VERY short lashes and it did a great job. I didn't see much of a curl, probably as my lashes are really short. But it does lengthen and makes it look voluminous. And you get two!! No problem taking it off with a make up remover or a good cleanser. Not sure if it dries out fast but so far, alongside IT's superhero mascara, this is my favorite!",10 Aug 2020,Wow!,Anshuc003,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This is hands down the best mascara ever ! My lashes have never looked better . I like to wear falsies but with this mascara I definitely will flaunt my natural lashes more often now . I had already gotten my hand on this one when it came out and luckily I got one gifted by Huda beauty too . I will surely need the extra one because I am in love with this one and I will keep using it and repurchasing it . Those of you who don't like to wear falsies please give this one a try . I also love the fact that there is two mascara and you can wear whichever you like according to your mood or wear both sides for the fullest effect . I highly recommend this one . Thanks to Huda for always being so innovative and coming out with the best products ever.,10 Aug 2020,The bestest out of all I have ever used ! -Basma,EnchantedBasma,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This mascara is pretty good. It gets the job done with lengthening the lashes but for volume I didn‚Äôt really see a big difference. The curved side works really well for my bottom lashes. It‚Äôs definitely not waterproof or kinda sweat proof. It‚Äôs was lightly raining one day and once I checked my lashes I had smudges under my eyes. The same thing happened on a really hot day. The humidity level was high that day so it depends on where you live. Really nice packaging. I received this product complementary from Influenster for testing purposes.,9 Aug 2020,Overall decent,Celiadiane,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"If it‚Äôs very important to you that your eyelashes stay separate and overall have a very nice shape to them, this is it. I tried the Dior overshow mascara hoping for those results but the wand in this mascara is different and really allows for absolutely no clumps and perfectly swiped on mascara. I am lucky to have long eyelashes that are not resistant to curling, and this mascara perfectly complimented them keeping each eyelash separate yet defined. And it only takes one coat!",9 Aug 2020,Eyelashes stay apart!!!!,Aislinnp,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"The Legit Lashes Mascara did exactly what it claimed. In my opinion, one of the few new mascaras that follows through with their packagings promise. I like that there are two different formulas and brush shapes. You truly need both. The thicker end to add the volume and thickness, and the other side to curl lenghten and seperate. I will definitely pick this one up again. Its worth a try, I know you all already use two different mascaras to get the job done, why not use just one?",9 Aug 2020,Does exactly what it claims to,mquaranta,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"First ill note that this is 2 formulas in one, so you're getting 2 mascaras for the price of one. Second ill note that i have very blonde eyelashes and hate falsies, and this gave me EXTREME length. I wear contacts and only experienced a brief 10 min, period where i had to blink until comfortable.I rated a 4 due to that and the clumping i recieved upon first application.

So I decided to give this a try. I‚Äôm usually very picky about mascara and was going to avoid this product because she usually dumps a ton of France ace in everything. The curl and length side was better in my opinion. It actually made a difference in my lashes while the other side didn‚Äôt do very much at all.

"Unfortunately this mascara did not work for me. I have short and straight Asian lashes and I was recommended this mascara by a worker who used this brand. However, the formula instantly weighed down my lashes and flattened what little curl I achieved from my lash curler. Even the drugstore Maybelline Lash Stiletto mascara gave me more volume and held my curl. The only problem I had with that was smudging which is why I was looking for a new mascara but this did not work for me at all.",2 Aug 2020,Not for Asian lashes,glor25,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"This two-in-one mascara really does what it says - it adds significant volume and length. The only thing that didn't work for me personally was that it doesn't hold the curl very well since I'm Asian and I have naturally straight, sparse, short lashes. How I make this work is that I typically use a lash curler and a mascara that holds my curl as a base, wait for it to dry a bit, and then apply this Huda Beauty mascara and it makes a huge difference - the volume and length just grow and grow. Using this mascara alone will make my lashes look full and long but super straight as it weighs them down. It's a rather thick formula but doesn't feel heavy on the lashes. I can see that it will be amazing and effortless for those who have naturally long, curled or relatively full lashes. One negative side that I noticed about this mascara is that it smudges under my lower lashes after a few hours so I have to be diligent on checking and wiping it away with a Qtip. But I can live with it since the effect is so good. The good thing about it is that the smudging doesn't happen repeatedly every couple of hours so I don't have to constantly check throughout the day. For me it seems to smudge once and after I clean it up it doesn't happen again. I'm really glad I gave this a try.

My Rimmel has a fatter bristles and have a different type of applicator. Anyway...i used the volume side first,  then the length & to my surprise...it worked great on my lashes!

I recieved this complimentary from Huda Beauty. Unfortunately this product didn‚Äôt work very well for me. I really like the double sided concept tho.

"The Huda Beauty Legit Lashes Mascara gives you the option to create the look of false lashes with out applying fake lashes. It has a dou  double-ended mascara so you get two different mascaras, one that creates Volume and the other length and curl. The mascara comes in a dimon shape containers that takes a little getting use to holding. Both of the mascaras have different wands the one on the volume size is rather big and takes some practice using if not you will get product all over the top of your lids. The wand on the length & curl side is much smaller with a crescent shape it is easier to use & helps separate & define the lashes. The mascara does what it says it gives you the appearance of having false lashes since it is a very black mascara & does give you volume and length, it wears for 8 hours with out transferring. The mascara can be easily washed off with makeup remover, this mascara is by no means water proof it washes out & remove so fast with water. So dont expect it to be tear proof or water it will definitely smudge. Either than that this is a nice mascara it does what it says you just have to learn how to apply it since it does have a little learning curve to it to achieve the effects it claims to. My eyes did not get irritated or anything while wearing it. I would definitely purchase in the future.

"Was pretty psyched when I was receding this mascara because I had slim pickings at home and they were in pretty rough, dry, shape. I have short, pretty straight, and not a whole lot of lashes to begin with and from the reputable brand I was expecting a major look, sadly it didn‚Äôt work out for me. The first time I applied this I used both sides and it left my eyelashes a little clumpy and my lashes were parted and almost cross eyed if that makes sense. Since they didn‚Äôt look, err, normal, I decided to reapply on another day. The times after when I applied it just for length, or volume, or both it just colored in my lashes a little bit but I didn‚Äôt see much of a wow effect.

"Upon first application of this mascara, I was instantly blown away! I first tried the curl and length end because my lashes are pretty full, but they sit flat. After one sweep of the mascara, my lashes were curled up in a way I‚Äôve never seen a mascara perform for me. I was so excited that a product could actually work without having to over apply. I then added some of the volume side because I was so amazed by the sister side. It worked great to add that nice black color and make my lashes appear thicker. I liked the bristles of this side, as well, because it worked really well to separate my lashes instead of making them clumpy. I also found that a little goes a long way.

"Before receiving this product as a free sample, I was intending on buying it myself. I thought the innovation and idea behind the product was genius. I have often heard of people layering multiple (usually 2) mascaras that does different things for an enhanced combined look. However, the idea of packaging the two different mascaras into one tube is what intrigued me. One side for curling and lengthening and the other for volumizing. Typically I look for volumizing mascaras, but ever since I dabbled with eyelash extensions, my real long lashes have mostly fallen out; leaving me with tiny baby lashes. Thus, now I look for both volume and lengthening. Huda (the brand owner and MUA) suggests using the volumizing side first then the curling and lengthening. However, I tried that way and by switching the two around. I found that by using the curling and lengthening side first then the volumizing side, I liked the results much better. My lashes looked longer and thicker. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5, was that I expected a little more in the results. I wish it added a bit more volume to my lashes than it did. It certainly did what it advertised to do (curl and lengthen & volumize), but I think I just expected a little more ‚Äúoomph‚Äù from a product like this.

"This really brought life to my non-existing eyelashes. Even just doing the volume side does a great job, then both together you can really see the action. I had a little smudging on the top but nothing crazy.",29 Jul 2020,,marblebeauty,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"This was my first Huda Beauty product and WOW(!) I am hooked. I have minimal eyelashes, particularly on the bottom lid. Sometimes I wear falsies, but I fear lash extensions will only cause more of my lashes to fall out. This, I have been on a mission to find a mascara that helps make my eyelashes pop without having to add falsies or get lash extensions. So far I have tried everything from drugstore brands to high end, without much luck. So when I got this mascara I did not have high expectations, but low and behold, this mascara exceeded my expectations. 1) I have sensitive skin and this mascara did not irritate my eyes. 2) This mascara does elongate the lash, curl it, and add volume (they are NOT LYING). 3) The smaller wand made applying it to my itty bitty baby bottom lashes so easy, and actually made it look like I have bottom lashes for the first time in a long time. 4) It stays on all day, but removal is easy with simple makeup remover. I am in LOVE with this mascara, and now I cannot wait to try more Huda beauty products.  I won‚Äôt be buying another mascara, both wands are perfect for any eyelash type, and will give you the results you expect from a mascara. This far exceeds anything on the mascara market in my opinion. Thank you Huda!!! Life changing!!",29 Jul 2020,LIFE CHANGING!,Lizzcat,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"This is a very good mascara, but it doesn't check all the boxes for me. I like that I can customize my look since it has the two ends, but I rarely have the time in the mornings. The volume side really does add noticeable volume, but I wouldn't say it's to the level of falsies. I like to layer the curl and length side on top to brush out my lashes so it's not as clumpy looking. I was pleasantly surprised that the curl and length mascara actually does add a bit of lift to my lashes, even without using a lash curler. Both mascaras have decent staying power with just a little smudging for me, which with my watery eyes and oily eyelids is impressive.",28 Jul 2020,Both are solid mascaras,kl510,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"My lashes are very fine and sparse and tend not to hold the curl. But with one swipe of the curl & length side, the difference is very noticeable.

I was gifted this by the brand. This mascara is quite nice but it did sadly transfer throughout the day. It definitely did volumize the look of my lashes and I really did like that!

"This is a wonderful mascara and I am happy that I received it for testing.
I have my own beautiful eyelashes. but they are thin and very pale. because of this, eyelashes are almost invisible on my face if they are without make-up.
Usually volume and lengthening mascaras stick together my lashes. They give my lashes a spider-like effect.
but not this mascara!
Hudabeauty mascara is the best I've tried for my eyelashes.
I can choose the effect I need - lengthening or volume. For example, for daytime makeup I use lengthening mascara, and for evening makeup I use volumizing mascara. It's very convenient that I have two products in one!
Mascara does not smudge, lasts at least 8 hours. Mascara can be easily washed off with makeup remover. During the testing period, I had no skin irritation or burning eyes. This is now my favorite mascara.",28 Jul 2020,my new love,Petkilova,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"New go to mascara, firstly I love the shape of these wands they coat and separate all of my lashes.

"I‚Äôve worn this a few times before giving a review because I wanted to really test it out. Due to the virus I didn‚Äôt get to wear it outside but I did wear it for hours in the house so feel I can give an informed opinion.

I was really pleased with this mascara. I‚Äôve been disappointed by claims before of super volume and length and while this is not perfect, I still felt it gave my lashes that extra pow that I was looking for. 

As for formula this is pretty wet and takes a bit to dry, so beginners be careful cause it will transfer when you blink if it‚Äôs not set. Also since this is a dual product and it is meant to layer, I would highly recommend waiting for the first coat to completely dry before applying the second step. I got volume and length but did not really achieve much curl, so keep that in mind. 

I love the packaging, with the dual brushes. The length side is super skinny and tiny making it easy to get those pesky bottom lashes. 

Overall I really enjoyed this, I still have my holy grail mascara product but I will definitely add this to my rotation regularly. I‚Äôm curious if the formula will become drier with use/air, because I just find it a tad too wet so I kind of hope it does!",27 Jul 2020,"Not holy grail worthy, but still pretty great!",Hp1117,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I don‚Äôt even curl my lashes prior to using the mascara and they stay upright the whole day. I appreciate the two different wands. It ticks every box for what I look for in a mascara, in my opinion.

I have short pin straight lashes and have been looking for the perfect mascara for years. I‚Äôve tried high end and drugstore and could never find one that ticked all my boxes. So I usually buy two separate mascaras one waterproof to hold a curl in my lashes and one to add volume and length. This one is everything I want! The formula is thin & wet which I like because I feel like it‚Äôll take longer to dry out over time. The curl and length side is so perfect for that no makeup makeup look. The wand defines and coats every lash and doesn‚Äôt smudge under my eyes. Even though it doesn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs waterproof I still feel like it holds a curl really well. The volume side is amazing to get my lashes dark and thick but not clumpy! The wand is small enough to get the corner lashes and it doesn‚Äôt flatten out the curl.

"I don‚Äôt have much experience with bold mascaras as I like a more natural and separated look instead. I have pretty long and straight lashes. I did find that this product worked best for me when i curled my lashes first, then applied the volumizing formula and then the lengthening formula.  I found the formula did stick my lashes together but with a brush through with a clean spoolie the lashes separated nicely and kept their length and volume.  This took a little getting used to esp with the heavier wand and larger brush but the volumizing tip was good for the inner corner lashes that i rarely reach. I also found that giving a quick curl at the base of the lash after the mascara dries definitely helped with a longer lasting curl. This was my first time really using a bolder and thicker mascara formula like this and overall i would say that there is a sort of learning curve to it but it was easy to figure out within the first few uses",25 Jul 2020,,vshinkawa,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

It just depends on the day, but I love how versatile it is. When I'm doing a full glam look, I'll use both sides, and I always get compliments on my lashes!

I mean you can use one side or the other or use both to get the voluminous curled effect. The mascara lived to my expectations. I have small thin lashes and this product actually gave volume.

"This is a great mascara if you are used to drug store and were interested in higher end. I like using the length first and then volume as I feel that going in that order gives your lashes more of a faux look. I‚Äôve used it consistently for about a week and have gone to work and lounged around. It‚Äôs great for work as it doesn‚Äôt budge or sweat off and I can‚Äôt even feel it on my lashes. I did not give this five stars though because the volume side can be a little clumpy and the wand on that side is more springy compared to the lengthening wand. I also like that the mascara is easy to remove when YOU want it to. Using one side or the other is great, but using both together really gives you the look of having fake lashes",22 Jul 2020,Faux-Lashes Look,JJJanis,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"So I've been trying this product for awhile now. First off for the price is great. The packaging is super cute. It does the job and doesn't smudge. The only things that I would say is that it did like to clump my lashes together. The other one is when you remove it off and, wake up the next day you will look like a raccoon.

"‚ÄúThis review is coming from someone with short brittle eyelashes, due to constant  eyelash extensions and fake store bought applications. Let me just say, this mascara  is a game changer for me. It made my thin little lashes look super long and full! Looks like I have falsies on. I love it. This product takes the pressure of having to have lashes put in all the time. Helps me on the daily and saves me a ton of money and time. The only con would be the actual design of the product. It‚Äôs kinda bulky. Would be great if it came in two separate parts.

It‚Äôs a really well formulated mascara. It has really good applicators in both sides. The formula is pitch black with a slight scent. Nothing extremely fragrant or chemical like. The application process was really easy and it creates the illusion of long eyelashes. The formula layers really well too. I really do enjoy the formula of this product.

The length/curl wand did a great job of lifting my lashes without me having to use a curler and the volume wand added just enough volume on my lashes without making them look clumpy.

I have used this mascara three times now and I love it! I use both sides every time and it is definitely voluminizing that way. The first time I wore it I had foundation on my skin and there was zero fallout after about 16 hours of wear. The second and third time I wore it without foundation on my skin and there was a small amount of transfer on my lower eyelid but I have oily skin so this is normal for me.

The application with the bigger was very difficult cult for me. The brush was very difficult to work with.  I do not blame it entirely on the  brush or the formula.  It might be because I have small lashes so the application is easier with a smaller  brush. Lucky for me this mascara had them both!

"I've been using the product for a few weeks now. I love the packaging and the concept is great! It includes two wands, one on each side that help you to achieve different looks. One side gives volume and the other side adds curl and length. I tried 3 different looks using each side alone and then both wands together. For me I got the best results with the curl and length wand! The volume wand clumped up on me a bit. When using both wands I recommend using the volume wand first then declumping with the other wand.

I could like the look with this mascara but I get racoon eyes within 30minutes of doing my thing and blinking through out the day.

I also liked how my lashes felt soft and flexible to the touch. I liked the lengthening side better and I will be using that almost daily but adding a coat of the volumizing definitely added some drama. One thing I wasn‚Äôt a bug fan if was the packaging, while it looks nice I found it a bit uncomfortable and chunky while applying.

The idea of two different mascaras in one seems like a good idea, but I don't prefer it. I like to store my mascara upright, I believe it prolongs consistency and use (I don't recommend using outdated mascaras. Mostly because of bacteria growth from prolonged use.) I did very well enjoy the volumizing formula, but I wear contacts most of the time and found that it would flake a lot into my eyes and cause irration (Sometimes having to take out my contact in either eye.)

I really love this mascara! I was concerned about buying this due to the mixed reviews but this mascara was exactly what I have been looking for since my favorite one was discontinued by Lanc√¥me 7 or 8 years ago. This creates great volume and holds curl all day without a smudge or flake yet removes easily with cleansing oil. I am a contact lens wearer and it does not irritate my eyes. I use the volume side concentrating on the base of my lashes then use the curl & length side concentrating on middle to tips.

I love the concept of dual brushes and dual formulas. The ‚Äúvolume‚Äù side is perfect for loading up, and the ‚Äúlengthen‚Äù side stretches it out for beautiful length! I do find that I have to work very quickly, as it starts setting fast and will get clumpy if I take too long. The only thing I‚Äôd improve on is the ‚Äúlengthen‚Äù brush - it‚Äôs a molded plastic and I prefer a hourglass bristle brush to help separate the lashes. 

The formula doesn‚Äôt flake or fade on me over the course of the day. This is one of the only mascaras where my lashes look just as good at the end of the day as they do at the beginning!",17 Jul 2020,Gorgeous mascara!,abbyrose87,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

My lashes have never looked so voluminous or long. Even with multiple coats of other mascaras I never achieve the results that this gave me. Each formula can definitely be used on its own, but the combination of both formulas is unmatched. Each formula can definitely be used on its own, but the combination of both formulas is unmatched.

"This mascara sounded amazing, unfortunately I wasn't as impressed as I expected. It's not the worst but not amazing. I like that this gives you options in an applicator and function. I had trouble with applying it because of the thick formula (easily smudges and not waterproof) and holding the wand itself. As other reviewers said, it's clunky, I found it hard to apply, especially in the hard to reach areas. I wanted to love it but the formula just isn't for me.

"This makes my lashes look FANTASTIC. I‚Äôve experimented with using each side as well as the combination of the two, and I look great either way.

I only gave it 2 stars because I guess when you layer it multiple times it works.

"Ok, received this package today and I put it on asap. I did 2 coats of the mascara (1 for each end) and I was amazed at how much length the mascara gave my eyelashes! I sent videos to so many of my friends showing them so they can purchase as well cause girl, this mascara was so good! The packaging didn‚Äôt bother me at all. Its dual ended so its going to be a bit bigger than your single wand mascara but, thats also a plus since you get a bunch of mascara anyway and they don‚Äôt give you a small amount for the price you are paying. I went for a long bike ride and today was also really hot outside. Given the workout, I forgot i had the mascara on and wiped my face a couple times and let me tell you that this thing didn‚Äôt smudge on my face!!! I was amazed girls. I mean to each their own when it comes to opinions but, I truly love this mascara. Huda always outdoes herself on all her products. I know she doesn't sell them until she perfects them. Its my new go-to mascara now and I can assure you i‚Äôve tried so many mascaras and i don't fall in love with any first round of using them however; love this one.

"I like that this mascara has 2 formula options depending on your look or needs. Personally I only use the volume side as I naturally have long lashes that don‚Äôt need any extra length.

I love the formulation on this mascara !! I usually have to add on layers on with other mascaras.  But with this one I dip it once‚Äôs and it‚Äôs enough for both eyes and my bottom lashes.   I love how it has the duo brushes.  It‚Äôs so much easier to separate my lashes with using the smaller brush and easy to apply product on my bottom lash.

I really loved the concept of this mascara. I am regularly using a lengthening and a curling mascara to achieve my favorite lash look. The reason why I was excited about this product was now I could use one thing instead of reaching for two mascaras every time. Unfortunately this mascara clumped my eyelashes together and did not separate them at all. On top of that the mascara formula is very wet so it easily transferred to my eyelid during the application and then to the top of my brow bone during every day where. I am going to leave the tube open for a little bit while I do my make up and hopefully this will dry the formula out so I can get some use out of it. I am very happy I received this product for free for review purposes only otherwise I would not purchase it.,8 Jul 2020,Not for me,melevated,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"This mascara is one of my new favorites and I love the packaging of it. Both sides definitely do what they say giving me the curl, length and volume.

Was really excited to try a new this product from Huda what an impact and business woman she is!!! But after the first few times of using it I realize pretty much every time I had to wipe off a bunch of product with a napkin before using it otherwise it was too much product on my eyelashes.

I want to give this mascara 5 stars so badly! The length and volume it gives is incredible....but it flakes so bad!

"I really like this concept of two different formulas in one. For the price you can‚Äôt beat it the lengthening and curl formula is my favorite out of the two only because I like a more natural look, but when you use both formulas together it‚Äôs seriously magical. The Volumizing side reminds me a lot of the better than sex mascara which is one of my personal favorites. Both of these formulas have fibers in them which really take your lashes to the next level again I like the fact that you have two different formulas that can be used independently or together, I like they give you options,  basically for the price of one mascara you get two I would 100% recommend this to anyone that likes the better than sex formula and anyone that really looks for a lengthening and curling formula.",7 Jul 2020,Must try mascara,Rashaad,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"This is a nice mascara, but it did not give me the wow factor that I expected from its name. Each side by its self was an average day to day mascara, I could not personally see a difference between the two ends. When you combine them you do get a more dramatic look! The reason I didnt give it five stars is because when I compared it to all of my other mascaras (thrive, and tarte) it took more coats to get the same look. 

I would like to note that I have very sensitive eyes and I cant wear all mascaras, but I can wear this one just fine! So it works for sentive eyes which is a plus!

I think this is a super innovative product by huda beauty. The formulas are good (nothing exceptionally amazing) but they remind me of the roller lash and bad gal bang from benefit cosmetics and is a very intense black. What I think sets this one apart is being able to have the two options to choose from at a comparable price. It was super helpful to get the volume and then be able to go in with the lengthening to kind of comb the lashes out. I would say it‚Äôs the most practical mascara for bolder lashes sold at Sephora.,6 Jul 2020,most practical convenient mascara,caisadilla,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"In theory this product seems amazing, two formulas in one convenient package. The idea itself is brilliant however the product doesn‚Äôt live up to that.

"I am really impressed with this mascara. No more need to have two mascara, one for the lengthening and one for the volumizing. you have all in one. you can use only one side or both for extra drama for your lashes.

This mascara is really volumizing and lengthening!

"I like that it's 2 formulas and you can use 1 or both together. I mostly used both together as I like the look of a thicker lash. It was easy to apply, minimal clumps and removed easily.

I would recommend for someone looking to use 2 formulas for the same look.",6 Jul 2020,Two formulas in one,MyNameIs1,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I really like the applicators. I use both the sides. I naturally have long lashes so I use volume side only and sometimes to add drama use the lengthening side. It applies smoothly.

This mascara works decently for me.  It‚Äôs not the most amazing I‚Äôve ever tried but it is a nice black color and the packaging is very sleek and nice.  It gets a bit clumpy when you first pull out the wand.  You end up having to wipe some off because so much product comes out of the tube.

If you don‚Äôt mind doing that, the result is pretty nice.",6 Jul 2020,Cute but clump,Kaybae219,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"This mascara is okay in my opinion. Both ends can be used on their own or together. The directions suggest to use the volume side first then apply the curl + length side while it's still wet. Applying the second side while it's still wet makes it less likely for it to clump up. This product is easy to use, but just so much formula comes out and gets onto my lashes even when I try to remove the excess from the brush when applying. Because of this, I like this mascara using each side separately, not together. I honestly can't tell a difference between each of the formulas. My skin gets very oily, so this mascara smudged within 6 hours. Personally, I probably wouldn't buy this mascara because I already have mascara that works just as well and doesn't smudge as quick as this one.",5 Jul 2020,,ebellem,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I have been on a natural lash journey for a few months and finding a mascara that gives me great length and volume at the same time is hard to find.

"Decent enough mascara. I wore this on a workday (which is often filled with desk work and lots of conferencing) and it seemed like it held up well enough.

I actually really enjoy this mascara and will probably purchase myself. I received this as a sample and use it everyday. I love the component for the mascara it‚Äôs unique and comfortable to use. The best part of this mascara is that you can use each side separately to create more subtle/natural looking lashes or combine them to have dramatic lashes which is really nice for days that I work and need to tone down my makeup a bit.

I really liked this product! I loved the double ended brush because the slimmer side made it a lot easier to apply to bottom lashes. It definitely helped lengthen and volumize. However it only gets 4 stars because I wish the formula wore a little better. I did experience some flaking.,29 Jun 2020,nice mascara!,hickorydickory,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"i prefer using both sides together. it lengthens and gives the lashes volume. separately, they just aren‚Äôt my favorite formula. but together it‚Äôs great. i have noticed that towards the end of the day it starts to flake off. which isn‚Äôt the best but i can get over it because it hasn‚Äôt been a whole lot of flakes.",29 Jun 2020,,MeganLConnely,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This product is nice and adds volume to my lashes! I really enjoy the brush and the packaging is very nice!

I love this mascara!! It gives me length and volume without making my lashes feel clumpy! I don‚Äôt I notice and fallout underneath my eyes throughout the the day either.

"This is a beautiful mascara. It gives me just enough drama without looking fake or being flaky. My only complaint about the packaging is it‚Äôs not easy enough to determine which side is which before you open them, so I never got it right!

I used both sides for the best effect, using the volume side first like they recommend, but they can also be used independently for a softer look.",29 Jun 2020,,savolante,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I really wanted to love this product, but it wasn‚Äôt a full 5 stars for me. While I do love the dual wand packaging the results were a little lacking. The effect was a little spidery for my taste but my main issue with the product was the staying power. I live in hot and humid Florida and even with setting spray, the mascara was rubbing off by the end of the day. Made me look like I hadn‚Äôt slept in a day or two. I was also inside most of that day.

"Influenster sent me Huda Beauty's Legit Mascara to try, and since I like anything Huda, I gave it a go for a few weeks.

My lashes are pretty sparse and love to reach for the grounds, even as I'm pressing them upwards with curlers. Sooner or later, they will make the inevitable descent and point downwards, defiantly so.

The case is pretty thick and hefty. You receive 2 X 8.5ml / 2 X 0.28 fl oz. worth of product. It says ""2 X"" because this is a dual mascara, with wands on both ends of the stick.

I realize mascara is one thing you should never use beyond the expiration date, about two or three months after opening one, but if that wasn't the case, I might be able to use this one up to six months; there's so much product. (And not many lashes to speak of on me, alas.)

The whole effect is volumizing & lengthening & curling. Your lashes get immediate volume due to the 5mm fibers and soft wax.

Considering I have zero lashes to speak of (and the few that I've got refuses to stand to attention with or without the aid of a curler) this is an improvement. Since I misplaced my eyelash curlers months ago, this was without the aid of a curler. I really like what it does for my sparse lashes.

Can't speak much for longevity though, since it's been Quarantine for quite a while. It did not flake or change in appearance for the two hours or so I wore them consistently.",29 Jun 2020,,MSena,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I‚Äôd say if you are on the lookout for a great long wearing mascara that won‚Äôt flakes even after 24 hours wear then this is it! I cannot believe thats all i want in mascaras are finally been found in a single double head tube! I originally have short but relatively thick and straight lashes so am mainly looking for curls and length and this lengthening wind is amazing! It is thin and flexible and super easy to use and gives me the most beautiful long lashes i‚Äôve ever dreamed of! The voluminous side adds a greay volume as well giving my eyes more dramatic look. The mascara would clumps occasionally if I applied it in a rush so just be careful and all is set! I am completely satisfied with this mascara and i already recommend it to everyone i know!,28 Jun 2020,Strongly exceeded  my expectations,bonbon212,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
Received this product free with my Influenster account! I‚Äôm not a fan of the watery formula. It doesn‚Äôt give my eyelashes a strong curl. I feel like it‚Äôs heavy and weighs down my lashes.

"I really don't like this mascara. I typically don't use double ended mascaras, but figured to give it a try.
I always curl my lashes before using mascara and most mascaras keep the curl. This mascara was super thin and straightened my lashes. It completely undid all the curl they had. I can't speak for how long the mascara wears for, as I had to immediately wash it off and refuel my lashes and use my regular go to mascara.

"I don‚Äôt hate it but I don‚Äôt like it. I like the length and volume this combo gives my 41 year old lashes BUT it gives me raccoon eyes by the end of the day. Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs summer, humid and I have combination skin but I‚Äôve never quite had a mascara leave me with such dark circles under my eyes (and on my eyelids no matter how much setting powder I use). I keep a pointed Q Tip on hand to keep my eyes from looking so EMO all day. 

Despite that all, it is moisturizing and doesn‚Äôt flake..so YAY for that. My lashes have seemed healthier after using it for a couple of weeks. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd buy it again after trying the newest Marc Jacobs At Lashed mascara. It gives me almost the same effect and doesn‚Äôt rub off quite as much as LEGIT LASHES.

"If I could give half scores, I would give it a 3.5 instead. I really wanted to fall in love with this mascara. It does go on well, it is really nice and light weight on my lashes, and it doesn‚Äôt get clumpy. The problem I have is that it doesn‚Äôt keep my lashes up and curled like the mascara I regularly use. I always use an eyelash curler and then mascara, but no matter how much I curl my lashes before applying this mascara, they don‚Äôt stay curled up. I‚Äôve tried using the volume and curl&lengthen sides individually and together, but no matter how I try to use it, my lashes don‚Äôt stay super curled. If I‚Äôm not wearing winged eyeliner, then it doesn‚Äôt matter much and my lashes look fine with this mascara. But if I‚Äôm wearing eyeliner, my eyelashes aren‚Äôt visible when I wear this mascara. I‚Äôll continue using it on days I don‚Äôt wear eyeliner since it does a good job of separating my lashes, but I probably won‚Äôt purchase it myself since it doesn‚Äôt hold a good curl.

I LOVE the curling side. Brush was easy, made my lashes look good, and is INCREDIBLE for lower lashes. 
Volume side? Not so good.  Wound up making my lashes get really clumpy, really fast. Hard to look volumized when I wind up looking like I only have 10 lashes.

"This Mascara did not perform the way it is advertised. I did not care for the plastic bristlers on either end of the mascara.

"I was so surprised to see this had two different sides when it arrived - reminded me of the mid-2000's when this was popular! 
I did receive this product from Influenster in exchange for a review, but the opinions are my own. 
The Good: it does lengthen your lashes and provide volume quite well and keeps them this way. the formula doesn't flake! this mascara stays on all day. 

The Bad: two different mascaras, more opportunity for clumps. the formula stays wet for quite some time, so you have to be careful because it could leave marks on your face if you look up/down too soon. 

Would I recommend this product? Yes. 
Will I switch from my current formula? No, due to the mascara staying wet for too long - I'm constantly having to clean the marks off underneath my eyebrows.",27 Jun 2020,Felt like a throwback!,freshface44,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I received this product as a free sample to try. I will admit, I did not love it at first. It was a very wet mascara that took a long time to dry and would still smudge after, but after about a month of use the wands began to get drier/tackier but still fresh enough to deliver the claim of thicker, longer, curlier lashes. The dual wands seem superfluous to me‚ÄîI find that I can get similar results from mascaras with only one brush‚Äîbut by no means is that a deal breaker. There is no smell at all to the product, and it doesn‚Äôt irritate the eyes, which is lovely, as many mascaras tend to flake over the course of the day and irritate the eyes. 
I also love how it‚Äôs not waterproof, so it‚Äôs easy to take off, but you do sacrifice a bit in that department, when you run the risk of ruining your makeup if you tear up at all. 
All in all, I‚Äôm quite happy with this product, and what it does for my lashes. The only reason I don‚Äôt give it five stars is because of the dry time, and the extra step of using two wands to get the full effect.

I was not 100% impressed with this mascara sadly. I expected it to really lengthen my lashes and I honestly didn‚Äôt see a difference using this mascara and other drug store ones. Definitely not for the price either. The volume wand always had way too much product on it and the lengthen and curl one just didn‚Äôt do much.

I received this mascara for free to test. I use both formulas to achieve the best results. I did not like the lengthening formula on its own but I didn‚Äôt mind the volume on its own.  No flaking or smudging after wearing outside in 90 degree heat which is always a plus.

"I only thought about trying this as my cheap and cheerful mascara that I usually use has been discontinued. I have only tried a few higher end mascara but the ones I have tried this one is actually the most impressive, I'm not typically a fan of plastic brushes but I think you just have to be more careful when applying it.

It got to the point where I just stopped wearing mascara altogether because you couldn‚Äôt even tell I was wearing any when my lashes were just flat down even though I curled them. This mascara is the ONLY thing I have found which curls my lashes WITHOUT even using lash curler beforehand. Not only does it curl on application, the curl stays put the whole day.

"I was excited to try this product because I have naturally heavy, straight lashes and they hardly stay curled. I tried each side Individually as well as together. The volume brush was my favorite, my lashes were very defined and clump free. I have conflicting feelings about the length/curl brush. I felt like it clumped very easily on its own, but it worked great in combination with the volume brush. The mascara last all day and was easy to take off with makeup remover.

I‚Äôm not a fan of the packaging as it seems a bit bulky but I do like how heavy the tube feels.

I was honestly not expecting to like this product as much as I do! I have been using this mascara almost every day for a little over a month and I‚Äôm very impressed with it. As someone who wears two different mascaras everyday I love that this has both products in one tube. I love the plastic bristles and how black the two formulas but the reason I took one star off is because if these were sold separately I would not buy the lengthening side. I feel as though with just that side it does lengthen which is obviously what it‚Äôs supposed to do but it leaves the lashes thin and kind of crunchy feeling whereas the volumizing side does a great job making them thick as well as lengthens them. So I do like the product but I‚Äôd love to see an option to just buy either side for a cheaper price otherwise it might not be a product I run out to buy as soon as I finish it. This product was sent to me for review purposes.,23 Jun 2020,,joshbalz,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I just am not a fan of this product. The brush bristles are pointy, the formula is all gunned up on the brushes no matter what. Using either (or both) side resulted in clumpy lashes.

"This is such an interesting mascara! I like how it is dual ended and I can use different brushes and cater to my needs. I wish one was smaller for my lower lashes, but I can still make it work. The formula is good, but since it is the summer and I sweat and a lot and have oily skin so I do get some smudging every once in a while. But, it isn‚Äôt terrible as others and it‚Äôs easy to clean up. It is a bit bulkier than most mascaras but it‚Äôs easy to find in my makeup case.

I say 3.5 stars. It is really dark which I like and not clumpy at all. It definitely adds length but I find it actually adds a lot of weight.

"I wanted to test it out for a while so I could give a fair and honest review. First off the packaging is a really nice unique design, you would think it's bulky but I really love the shape and it fits well in the hand. since you get basically two mascaras in one the price is good. the actual wands I love the curl and define side of it, it does give great definition. The volume side I'm not a fan of the the applicator to be honest it's a little messy even when you wipe the exta product off. The actual product the curl and define side I was super impressed with because it kept my lashes curled all day and mine usually fall by the end of the day but even after wearing this mascara for 12 hours sometimes longer my lashes stayed curled. The volume side I am not a huge fan of the formula, I personally could not build up volume without my lashes looking clumpy and like spider legs so I only do one thin coat on my lashes and it didn't really give a full voluminous look to the lashes. Pros to this mascara unlike some fiber mascara it does not flake off in two hours and the fibers don't end up in your eyes while applying it. the curl and define side I love the formula it keeps the lashes in place all day is nor clumpy and gives beautiful definition with or without lashes. honestly I wish thia mascara came with the curl and define part only and that's why I rated it three star's because I'm not a fan of the volume side. overall though good mascara.",22 Jun 2020,,nightmarev,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I received this mascara from Influenster but that in no ways affects my review, this is my honest opinion. 

I really love this mascara! I was a die hard fan of the Milk Kush mascara but this has blown me away. I love the versatility of 2 brushes and 2 formulas in one place! I really enjoy doing one pass of each for the best of both worlds. The volume side can clump if you are not careful and use one too many swipes, thus the loss of one star. However, it still blows me away, I just recommend less is more with that side. I am totally sold on the curl and length side but like the extra something the volume gives me. I love having 2 mascaras in one and and I've found myself reaching for this over my ride or die Milk Kush. Definitely get it if you're on the fence it's fantastic and I've found it lasts all day, more than I can say for so many mascaras!!

"Mascara is my favorite item of make-up and I love trying different ones. Huda Legit Lashes Mascara is unique. Both these formulas can be worn alone or layered together to provide different styles because they build very well. The Curl and Length formula actually provides some lift. My lashes naturally curl on their own, but this mascara adds a gentle additional curl which I have never seen in a mascara before. The Volume formula¬† provides a very good body. My favorite¬† way to wear this is one base layer of Curl and Length and then 2 layers of Volume. The product dries a little hard but stays on well without smearing. It's not the easiest mascara to apply the first time, but it's easy to figure out. You just have to put it on delicately or it can clump a little when being put on, but will brush out well.

I‚Äôve had issues since my eyes are sensitive and this mascara didn‚Äôt irritate my eyes at all! This is the mascara I‚Äôve been waiting for!!! 

Day One : I tried just the volume side. I liked how lush my lashes looked with just this side one. Only downside, I did get a bit racoony during the day. But this could be my own fault, because I work from home and really had slathered on eye cream that day. 

Day Two : I tried just the curl and length side. Wow. I kept checking myself out in the mirror. Thinking I‚Äôm so cute at home. I didn‚Äôt get raccoon eyes. At all!! 

Day Three : WOW!!! This sealed the deal for me. I tried both volume and curl and length. I felt like I had the best eyelashes in the world. They just looked so good with mascara, and again, no raccoon eyes.

This is a game change. Long thick lashes in under 10 minutes when using both mascaras. The curl holds beautifully throughout the day!

Even after an hour long cardio workout the worst I could see was some minor smudging on my upper lids (I have VERY long lashes but they're light!). The color is a nice, rich black & very complementary. I highly recommend this mascara! A tip or two: Comb through each layer of mascara with a spoolie or lash comb so as not to get clumps.

"*I received this mascara for free to try out from Influenster.* I love the idea of a double ended mascara, one side for volume and the other for length.

"I cannot give it five stars because it doesn't impart a lot of volume nor does it curl.

"I got a sample to try and I‚Äôm so glad I did. Mascara is my obsession and since I don‚Äôt use falsies I‚Äôve probably tried just about every mascara on the market. I had to know what a ‚Äúclinically proven‚Äù mascara was all about.

It was AWFUL. So very bad. My lashes all stuck together while try to put it on, then I went in with the volume side and it made the even worse. All clumped together, not actually volume or length. I went through it with a lash separator and went about my day, with the mascara still on my lashes looking like crap. Not even 2 hours in I looked in the mirror and I literately looked like a raccoon. I‚Äôve never had a mascara run? this badly. Everything that was left on my lashes ended up under my eyes.

I received this mascara from influenster as a sample.  I really love how my lashes look after I applied both sides of the mascara. I like the voluminizing side more than the lengthening if you want to use them on their own. But I think it works best when you use both sides at the same time. This mascara has fibers in it which make my lashes look longer. Although it can make them look clumpy if you go in with more than two coats so I suggest just using one coat on each side of the mascara. I did wear it for about 6 hours and I noticed some bleeding under my eyes which is normal for many mascaras. Overall I highlight recommend this mascara.,18 Jun 2020,AMAZING!!,Mernmern,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I received this product free from Influenster, but I was planning on buying it anyways. I love Huda Beauty‚Äôs products and knew she would come out with an amazing mascara. Well I was right! This is one of the BEST mascaras that I have ever tried! At first I wasn‚Äôt used to the shape of the package, but now don‚Äôt mind it. I love that you get two different types of mascara in one component. They each do something completely different. My favorite side is the volume side because I find that the formula is super black and volumizes AND lengthens my lashes. I like to use the volume side first and then the curl and lengthen side second, which is the way Huda suggests to use her mascara. I am lucky enough to have long lashes anyways, but it is hard to find a mascara that really makes them stand out, volumize, super lengthen them, and not make them clumpy at the same time. This mascara does all of that! It has become my holy grail mascara and has replaced all of my other favorite mascaras! It actually replaced my love for the new Anastasia Beverly Hills mascara and the Nars climax mascara! I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to volumize and lengthen their lashes.

Not my favorite mascara. I found the wands to be bulky and awkward to use. I feel like it left my lashes clumpy and awkward looking.

If you are looking for volume this one doesn‚Äôt quite hit the spot.

This mascara gives unbelievable length. The color is very dark which makes for a dramatic look that really makes the eyes pop. If you love the falsy look without the hassle of actually putting on false lashes then this is perfect for you. The price isn't bad at all when you consider you're getting two mascaras.

This could be a personal problem however it clumped my eyelashes.

"I received this product as a free trial from influenster and I‚Äôm so glad I did because I would have NEVER bought this for myself but I really like it! (Sorry if you see more than 1 review from me, I‚Äôm unable to track down my original submission) I usually hate mascaras that are intended to be layered and I still hate this mascara if it is layered! It‚Äôs just too thick and clumpy to use both sides on one eye. The wand on the volume side is not my favorite at all, it‚Äôs got short plastic bristles that are so spread out they leave plenty of room for this thick mascara to goop up between them which leads to an awful/hilarious application. I do not recommend this side at least at this point in time! But the lengthening side is great! The bristles are more evenly spread around the wand so they help to distribute the product better. This still is a mascara that will clump your lashes a bit which I used to hate until I tried this one - I actually kind of like the slightly clumped look this creates. It‚Äôs almost like a false eyelash look without all the work so I love that! Another bonus was this mascara does not flake on me even after a long day of wear which is so important to me as a contact lense wearer.

"I was immediately worried that this would be fragranced for some reason and I‚Äôm happy to report that it smells like any other mascara. I think the double-ended wand is a little gimmicky, but it works; I definitely see a difference when I layer the curling/lengthening formula over the volumizing formula. That said, it‚Äôs a tiny bit clumpy. I don‚Äôt mind a little clumping if the overall look is nice, so this effect isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker for me. The brushes aren‚Äôt too big and the formulas are on the drier side, which makes this ideal for my hooded eyes, as it minimizes transfer during application. I live in a humid climate, so I‚Äôve come to expect a little smudging under my eyes as the day progresses; this product met my expectations but was fairly easy to clean up. Of the two formulas, the curling/lengthening is the best and I wouldn‚Äôt mind having a full tube of that alone.",15 Jun 2020,Not bad!,plasticspark,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

The packaging is a little heavy and difficult to manuevar at times- so i wish it was a lil more movable. I didnt want ot use both sides together, so i stuck with the lengthening side (which is what im lacking the most of). It doesn't last all day, but enough for an 8 hr work day. I've never bought a Huda beauty product before, but i may reconsider that now that i actually like the mascara. Also to note I have very sensitive eyes even to the point that some concealers bug my eyes. This did not have any issues.",15 Jun 2020,New Fav?,breezyxm,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I don't think this is a bad mascara, it's just not my preferred type. I like the idea of two in one, but I would be more interested in one for top lashes and one for bottom. I'm not really sure if you're supposed to use both formulas at the same time... but other than for travel or to throw I'm your purse, I don't see a ton of appeal in having both in one.

Both formulas are pretty wet and have nylon type bristles, so if you don't like that kind of formula or brush, you won't be a fan. The length one is fine, it gives a very natural look and even though the formula was pretty wet (and gets messy super quickly), I was able to get a look I liked. I wear glasses a lot of the time, and this worked pretty well with them- meaning my lashes weren't constantly rubbing on my glasses and driving.me nuts. 

The volume one is even wetter and while it did add volume, it was too clumpy for my liking. It doesn't look terrible, but just not my style. 

I have a feeling a may like this more once the formula has dried out a bit more. I tend to prefer mascara that's had a few weeks exposed to air. 

Overall this reminded me of the Benefit BadGal Bang mascara, which also isn't bad, but not one I use often. The packaging is really nice and it's probably a fairly good deal to get both formulas in one. I also felt like this was blacker than other mascaras I've used, which looked nice. If you like really bold, dramatic mascara, you'll probably like the volume one and the length one is really good for a very natural look.",15 Jun 2020,"Formula not my favorite, but pretty good oversll",BuryMeinRoseGld,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I got the opportunity to try this free from influenster and I was so excited because I was already planning on eventually buying this item myself to try but I must say that I was slightly disappointed, I absolutely love her eyeliner and was hoping this would be the same quality but while I find that yes the mascara is both lengthening and volumising as it claims, it is also extremely clumpy for me, that is (I'll explain more on that further down) I am very fair and have light strawberry blonde hair which means my eyelashes are very fair/light. apparently I was double cursed because not only are my lashes so light they're almost invisible, but they are also almost non-existent as I have very short lashes with little volume; so you can imagine that I have very high standards for mascara. I feel like if my lashes were already a little longer, the mascara would be totally fine but it clumps my tiny stub lashes together and looks like I have even less lashes than I do. My thoughts here are not all negative though! I can without a doubt say that this is one of the darkest blackest mascaras I've tried and I have about ten different mascaras in my collection and have tried many more and this is absolutely the darkest of black color, I absolutely loooove the saturation of color its beautiful! I also thoroughly enjoy the look of the individual sides of the mascara by themselves but applied together it clumps too much for my liking (and I really don't mind a little clumping (I'm a huge fan of the 90s grunge look) but together it's a bit too much for my tiny lashes to handle. Again I think that if you have longer lashes and are mostly looking for volume with a little added length I think this mascara would be great for you! If you have tiny little stubs for lashes like I do then I'd say you'd probably be better off with a different choice.",15 Jun 2020,Mixed feelings to the max!,Superdork900,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
Runs off your eyes extremely easily and clumpy. Drugstore brands are better than this stuff.  Disappointed,15 Jun 2020,clumpy and NON waterproof,PrincesSindy90,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"All in all, this mascara is a good one! I enjoyed using both sides but felt partial to the brush included in the volume side so I felt myself reaching for that side only most of the time. I‚Äôm including a picture of my lashes with no mascara on top and with this mascara at bottom. Pros: I do see a noticeable increase in length and I really like that this mascara does seem to have a darker pigment than any of my drugstore ones. This mascara was also really good about not clumping when applied in moderation. When using both sides together, my lashes look so thick! Cons: Said darker pigment does make it more difficult to remove at night. I also found the thickness of the mascara tube unwieldy and hard to maneuver. It was difficult to reach my smaller lashes with this brush.",15 Jun 2020,,simplyiz,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I love HUDA beauty lip products and I wanted to love this. But it didn‚Äôt hold up to the claims. Volumizing .... where? Lengthening? None. You can literally wear maybelline mascara and it would look better than this. On to the next.,14 Jun 2020,Was disappointed,sln1234,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I really wanted to love this but as soon as I applied it my eyes started burning. It clumped up so much it began to smear under my eyes. The formula is not as it says and it is so much extra work having to use two different wands to get the lashes I want. Why can‚Äôt there just be one wand? Makes no sense.,14 Jun 2020,such a disappointment,rinavuitton,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"This is great, but it has to be used a particular way for the best results. First start with the volume wand and then if you want to more definition, more va-va-voom lashes, use the curl/lengthen side. When I first opened the mascara, I immediately used the curl/lengthen side and while I liked how it almost gave me an invisible eyeliner look, the lashes were clumpy and still straight, no curl in sight! The volume wand, however, was great and gave me the perfect fluttery eyelash look. I could have stopped there, but I then topped it off with the curl/lengthening wand and my lashes looked fantastic! So volume first and curl/lengthen second---that was my experience with this.",14 Jun 2020,Works well when used in the right order,psgr38,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I was really impressed by the Huda Beauty legit lashes. My eyelashes are already pretty long, so a mascara has to be pretty potent to have a noticeable effect. The legit lashes mascara, and in particular the lengthening formula, was amazing. I feel that it worked best with the lengthening end of the brush, but I like having the option to use either one.

"I felt like this mascara was just ok, not my favorite but not terrible. This formula did not flake or transfer on me and lasted all day. This mascara did give my lashes length and separation especially when using both sides wands & both formulas. I prefer fuller fluffy lashes and felt the volume was lacking in the mascaras performance. When I used this mascara I felt it gave my lashes a spider leg like appearance. I liked that the brand was trying to provide a two for one type of product and to appeal to more people but felt it fell short. I did find I favored one side the volume formula over the other.

I will start by saying this mascara is fantastic, if you don't have bad allergies that cause your eyes to water. I enjoy using this mascara, it looks great. Adds volume and length without looking too clumpy. Use a curler before to enhance the curl! The only thing that doesn't work for me, is that it is not waterproof, in the slightest. I have really bad allergies, causing my eyes to water with the smallest breeze. The mascara runs like crazy when it gets wet. It doesn't claim to be waterproof, so I can't knock it for that.

For what it advertises, I‚Äôd say the volume is great but the curling formula isn‚Äôt anything special. My lashes rarely hold a curl, so that‚Äôs not a big deal for me. 

There is just one bad thing, which is that this mascara smudges on my bottom lashes. But I like it so much, I just use a different mascara on the bottom.

1) It's two steps, and that is obnoxious. 
2) It falls out a little under my eye. I've tried it twice now, and each time I  was super careful to make sure it dried.

I'm very dissapointed in this mascara and I'm glad that I received it for free for testimg and didn't waste my own money on it! Both of the formulas are very thick which can lead to super clumpy lashes. The wands are also not great and the volumizing side is especially bad. The shape of the tube is also really hard to work with and cause some major slips is you don't have a really good grip on it.

"First off, the formula is way too chunky. You have to be very light handed to achieve evenness. After using both wands the lashes look bold and longer which is great! But not even 5 seconds after finishing the lashes just wilt down from the weight of the product. Also, the mascara runs like crazy, I wasn‚Äôt sweating nor caught in the rain and STILL within 2 hours I had to wipe the black smudges from my under eye. 
I used Thrive Cosmetics mascara before trying this because they use a similar fiber formula. 10000% recommend Thrive mascara compared to this!",11 Jun 2020,TERRIBLE. Returned after first use.,yolien,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"This is honestly the best mascara I have ever used! I am very picky when it comes to mascara. I do naturally have very long lashes, so using a mascara that doesn‚Äôt clump, flake or make my lashes look and feel too heavy is key. I really do love the formula, and how it feels on my lashes. Very light weight as if I have nothing on. The only thing I will say is that the actual unit is a bit chunky. Once you take a barrel out to use the wand, the component itself is not ergonomically ideal for applying to the lashes. Hits my cheek every time I try to use it. Other than that, I would definitely re-purchase. But maybe they could revisit changing the packaging.",11 Jun 2020,Yes please!,m8cupqween,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"This mascara is OK but my expectations were super high.  I followed the directions to use the volume side first then the curl side and vice versa and I really didn't see anything dramatic at all.  I usually use the Marc Jacobs primer and mascara and that combo really creates volume without any clumping.  I also use Dior Iconic as a base and YSL Faux cli as the finish and again, amazing results.  I wanted to love this especially since it is one tube for both bits, but I was very disappointed.  Nothing special.",11 Jun 2020,Meh,SuziRed22,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I gave this mascara several chances before I would write a review and unfortunately it is not good. The mascara is really thick and messy. The only side I could use was volume the other side made my lashes clumpy. The formula was too heavy and once dry it would easily flake off and run if my eyes got even a little wet. I found it to be really irritating to my eyes. I don‚Äôt know how this got good reviews because in addition to the above it did nothing for volume or lengthening.,11 Jun 2020,not worth the hype.

It didn't flake off after wearing it for for 5+ hours which is great but the worst part is when I tried removing it with my Neutrogena makeup wipe I noticed 3 lashes fell off from the left and 2 from the right. This was my second time trying it out and I noticed the same lash fall out first time too.

"First, I want to mention that this product was sent to me for free in an Influenster Voxbox. 
I've used it a few times now, and I love it. In fact, it's the first higher end mascara that I have thought was worth the money because it comes with a lot of product and it does what it claims.¬†
I have short lashes that grow downward and have absolutely 0 natural curl, because of this I always use a lash curler before any mascara and they still fall flat after only a few minutes. But not with this mascara. They stay up at attention the whole day. 
The shape of the applicators are perfect for each formula, but they are a bit big to use on lower lashes. (If she ever comes out with one for lower lashes with same formulas but smaller applicators, I will be ridiculously happy.) I recommend using the Curl and Length side first, and then the Volume side, otherwise it gets clumpy. Additionally, it's the blackest mascara I've ever seen, and it doesn't flake throughout the day. I even love the shape of the packaging. It takes a minute to figure out the right way to hold it, but once you do, it feels so secure in your hand. It's also really easy to remove with my Neutrogena wipes. I will most definitely purchase this again and again.",11 Jun 2020,Absolutely Love,ArielBrianna27,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I received this mascara free from Influenster. This has became one of my favorites. Its very handy to have 2 types in 1. It doesn‚Äôt clump or flake throughout the day. It looks amazing! The only downside is that it‚Äôs not waterproof.,11 Jun 2020,,tarac94,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"This was not my favorite mascara ever, but it was really good! It definitely volumized and didn't flake throughout the day which was a massive PRO. A couple cons were that a did find my eyes to look a bit racoony after a long day and it was kinda difficult to remove. Even with my best makeup remover (Banilla Co.) it took awhile and was hard because the mascara broke down into little particles that would get into my eye and were painful. Besides that, it looked amazing on!",11 Jun 2020,,Nicoleparkerrr,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I love how versatile this mascara is! The dual end makes it easy to use for different looks (Based on how dramatic or natural you went your lashes to look) and convenient to carry. I thought the volumizing side did a better job than the lengthening side and if you do more than 1 coat of each it can start a look a bit clumpy so be careful with that! It lasted all day and didn‚Äôt run, even in the heat and was pretty easy to take off with a micellar water.",11 Jun 2020,,juheeshah,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"To start off I was incentivized to review this product and I received it in a Vox Box from Influenster.

Not that all the nitty gritty is out of the way, let's talk about this mascara. 

Pros: double ended with a volume side and a length and curl side. Doesn't flake off. Stays pretty well all day. 

Cons: it isn't water proof. It is VERY black and very dark. It can be clumpy.

"It does what it says it does and makes lashes look longer. Despite this, the chunky and heavy wand leads to a lot of mistakes.

I found that both the lengthening and volumizing formulas were effective and did what they claimed to do. It washed off easily. However, I did find that it wore off some throughout the day, and left black marks around my eyes. Also, I thought shape of the brushes made it difficult to get to my lower lashes.

Having the separate volume, length and curl options is a serious game changer. You can choose one or use both depending on the mood- using both gives a serious falsies look.

"I received this product to test out from Influenster, and I was very pleased with the packaging of the product because it was a different design concept than other products I‚Äôve used before! I like that there are two brushes for application; one is for volume and the other for length to give that false eyelash look. I think the wands get enough product onto your lashes with one application; I found that there was minimal if any clumping and no smudging occurred, which allowed for better coverage. My overall opinion was that it made my eyes (which are blue) pop and it did kind of look like I applied false lashes without any of the hassle in application! Lastly, I was happy to have the addition of two applicator wands with different curvature, being that it was easier to use and it helped achieve the desired eyelash look! I would recommend trying out this product, it retails for 27$ which is a good price for the brand/experience of the product. (While I got this complimentary, I would purchase this product again).",9 Jun 2020,Great product!,ToniAnnMc,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I was super excited to try it out! I decided to try it with a natural look first. It goes on smoothly and the two wands make application easy and ensure that every lash is covered. I think my lashes looked quite voluminous and I did use both sides of the dual ended wands. I did notice quite a bit of flakiness after only wearing it for a couple hours.

"Ok, first off I'd like to say that I am not a full Huda Beauty fan. I've tried the concealers, baking powder and some shadows (ruby I love it) and was not enamored by any but the shadow. Anyway I was psyched for this because it looked like it would give me the length and volume I so desperately want on my almost non existent lashes.  Once I got it and put it to the heat test, it passed. This was using both ends, it was a little clumpy but I was able to smooth it out and it looked good. The only reason I dropped two stars is because I was watching dead to me and a few tears escaped, not full blown crying just a few tears. OMG not 5 minutes later I looked in the mirror and Racoon Heaven!! I know it isn't waterproof but come on! Like I have to wear this with a mask for how long? And now I'm gonna have to be checking myself all the time? I will try again, maybe just the lengthening side to see how it holds up but seriously Huda it's almost 30 bucks for a mascara and couldn't hold up to a few tears. Glad Sephora has a good return policy. KKW holds up better.",9 Jun 2020,I soooooo wanted this,marisol39,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"As someone who loves to layer different mascara formulas for a full false lash effect, this was great! It would be perfect if it were waterproof, but that's just a preference. Both sides are short rubber bristle brushes on the smaller side to avoid messy application. The Volume brush is flexible with a slight hourglass shape, best on bare lashes, while the Curl + Length is a harder brush for layering or bare lashes. On bare lashes, both brushes give a similar effect for the first layer, which is a lengthened lifted look with volume at the root. I suggest layering the Curl brush on top of Volume brush, since that gives a bold false lash effect that maintains separation. When starting with the Curl brush and layering on the Volume it results in clumpy lashes that aren't as flared and volume builds evenly from root to tip rather than fluttery ends. Overall a great choice!",9 Jun 2020,Great buildable mascara,reviewer155,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

My lashes looked all spidery so I added the length and curl side, which only made things worse. The mascara started getting all clumpy and my lashes started bunching together. I tried using the curl and length without the volume side and I barely noticed a change, still looked like I needed mascara. The curl side definitely did not help curl at all. The formulas used for this product aren‚Äôt very good. My lashes did look much better after the mascara dried, but the eye I used the ‚Äúvolume‚Äù on started to itch really bad.

I love that this mascara has two wands that you can use for either length and curl or volumizing. It has not clumped for me and goes on nicely.

I received this product from influenster and I am really liking it so far. I have been using this mascara for about 2 weeks now and it does last  for a pretty long time. It is extremely black which I love. The dual ended brush is great. I go in with the lengthening side first and then the volume side next and it does make my eyelashes look great. However I do not like this mascara for the bottom lashes as it transfers quite a bit. Overall it is a good mascara and I would definitely recommend it.,8 Jun 2020,,Kimmie1228,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"To be honest I was a bit scared when I opened the masacra as it was very thick! Not something I‚Äôm use to. However, it was very smooth to apply and left no clumps at all which was impressive.

"This is just another gimmick from Huda. Double ends are not needed. This is not waterproof, so if you have the slightest tears in your eyes, it will run a black river on your face. It also clumps. I get the same length and thickness on my lashes from Maybelline Stiletto. So, this is nothing special.  I've been using Maybelline Stiletto for years without any issues, and it's much, much cheaper. I would have returned this if the store was open.

"This mascara was 50/50 for me. The volume side works great. I really like the formula, it‚Äôs not heavy but it‚Äôs makes the lashes look really nice.

On its own it‚Äôs better, but I definitely like the volumizing formula more",7 Jun 2020,,cielocazador,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"While not my holy grail, it definitely fairs better than most. Both brushes are well made, doesn‚Äôt hurt when I apply so not too stiff. Doesn‚Äôt cause clumping or ‚Äúspider legs‚Äù. I liked the volume side more than the long and lengthening one. The volume side keeps the curl a bit better. For reference, I have very straight, sparse and stubborn asian lashes!

"I wish I had different thoughts on this product but it was a big no for me, on one side it was way to watery for my liking and on the other side the brush itself would not let me separate my lashes so it would clump up to much, within the hour of me wearing this mascara it smeared under my eye and in my inner corner ( which has never happened ) I don‚Äôt recommend this if your an oily person that sweats easily and doesn‚Äôt like a water consistency for a mascara",7 Jun 2020,Bummed,caguayo22,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I was looking forward to using Huda‚Äôs new mascara. It looked so promising in all her video‚Äôs and other people‚Äôs reviews. My lashes are long and dark, and of medium thickness. I tried the mascara as instructed by Huda; Volume and then Curl and Length. I even tried it vice versa. I‚Äôve tried the mascara with and without a Lash primer. For reference I use Dior‚Äôs Lash primer in the white tube. Volume did beef up my lashes a bit but not enough compared to previous mascara. Curl and Length helped define and bring out my lashes better, but still gave more of a natural finish. I was expecting more dramatic results. My lashes drooped through out the day, with the use of an Eye Lash curler. I always layer my mascaras and with layering, I found Legit Lashes made my eyelashes feel brittle and hard. The only positives I have, is Legit Lashes is an inky Black shade, Lengthening is substantial, and it is long-wearing. Sadly I Will be giving away or returning this. I get almost the same if not better results with Essence Lash Princess mascara. For reference I‚Äôve used a variety of mascaras from Charlotte Tilbury Legendary Lashes 2, Benefit They‚Äôre Real, a mascara from Sally‚Äôs Beauty, Essence that have provided me more beautiful and consistent results. This is another overhyped product for me.",6 Jun 2020,Sorely Dissapointed.,Shabxo,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I received this from influencer to try. I think the two sides is nice for everyone. Don‚Äôt have to debate which to get. It dried fast and has no weird smell.

"I was expecting a lot from this product because I watched a lot of great reviews...but it isn‚Äôt any better than drug store mascaras. I am pretty disappointed considering how expensive it was.

"I have always had a tough time finding the right mascara for me. Most mascaras clump up, lack volume, and don‚Äôt curl my lashes just right. However, this mascara exceeded my expectations. If you‚Äôre looking to buy a new mascara, this one is it!",6 Jun 2020,Exceeded Expectations!,rockindani11,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I absolutely love this mascara. It took me a little getting used to. I don't usually wear 2 coats of mascara because of clumping. I also wear glasses, so it can be a bit of a mess. These formulas dry really fast, so you have to apply them relatively quickly, but it's great for glasses wearers.

The 2 formulas work so well together, amplifying but not making a mess of my natural lashes. My favorite is the volumizing, I could wear it alone. 

There is a couple of minor downs. The wand is awkward to hold because of the shape and length, but you can get used to it. Also, these are great long-lasting formulas and ultra black, which means I had a harder time removing them. All this being said though, I would definitely get this mascara again. I was very impressed by it.",6 Jun 2020,,Jillyag,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I'm the type of person who needs to try all mascaras because she hasn't found the one that gives her the length and volume she needs while also not disappearing throughout the day or crusting underneath her lids. I was supper excited when my VoxBox arrived with a complimentary HUDA BEAUTY LEGIT LASHES Double-Ended Volumizing and Lengthening Mascara to test out because hey #alwaysonthesearch this mascara is pretty great, the shading on the product lasted me a full day without melting into my lashes or crumb around my lids. In regards to lengthening the product delivers, but didn't give me the volume I wanted or needed.

I would recommend this mascara to those who are really going after a lengthening feature.",6 Jun 2020,,TSAG,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I received this complimentary for testing in exchange for my honest opinion. Both brushes are too large to define my innner and outer lashes. The lengthening and curling side is clumpy if you don‚Äôt apply it just so, and I didn‚Äôt find it very curling or lengthening. I still found myself using my eyelash curler and lash primer because the mascara wasn‚Äôt doing much. I like the volumizing side, but wish they just called it ‚Äúdefining‚Äù since that‚Äôs closer to what it does. I do like that the formula is super black, but also found it flaky after a few hours.",6 Jun 2020,Meh,grilledchz,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"Wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but this product is actually fabulous! Have received so many compliments. The volume side was a tiny bit clumpy on its own, but the length and curl side defined the lashes and fanned them out perfectly. Together they layered so well and the final product was better even than some of my tried and true mascaras. Will likely use each formula in conjunction if I use it. Was very pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this mascara !",6 Jun 2020,Solid mascara,esharoy821,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I got this for free from Influenster to sample. I can‚Äôt say I was totally in love with this product. It did have a lot of pros like the curl+length side (it was really good), long wearing, fast drying, and it didn‚Äôt have a funky smell. But I didn‚Äôt like the volume side at all. It was thick, clumpy, and it weighed my lashes down. I did receive it complementary from Influenster though so I can complain too much.",5 Jun 2020,,amaliaburk,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I got this mascara a couple days ago, and upon opening the lengthening side, there were multiple little hairs on the wand. I removed them with tweezers, and stuck the wand back in the tube, but every time I would take it back out, there would be more hairs. I‚Äôve seen a few on the volumizing side, but that wand makes it harder to tell, so who knows if there‚Äôs more. I‚Äôm giving 3 stars because, while I was really excited to try this mascara, I was too nervous to do so, and can‚Äôt speak to the effectiveness or wear of the formula and cannot give a proper rating on those aspects. I‚Äôm not sure if I received a defective item or what happened, but I‚Äôm so disappointed this will probably be returned. Attached are a few photos for reference. Hopefully in the future this can be resolved and I can actually try this mascara and give a proper recommendation.",5 Jun 2020,,Alicksandruh,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I have very short and very straight lashes. I was excited to try out Huda Beauty's Legit Lashes Mascara due to the double-ended applicator mascara applicator wand that claims to curl and lengthen lashes while adding volume, something I also lack. After trying this multiple times, I can say honestly that although I like each end applied on its own, if you end up combining both formulas on your lashes, the clumping effect really starts. So I highly recommend either side but not both sides at once. The formulas don't seem to mix well.

I prefer the Curl and Lengthen side over the Volume side. The formula is non-clumpy and relatively easy to apply even for beginners. The wand applicator shape is also a lot more effective when it comes to pushing my lashes up and giving it a good length. On the other hand, I feel that it doesn't really effectively curl my very straight lashes even with the waxes and fibers included in the formula that is supposed to help with curling. I end up having to use an eyelash curler at the end to increase curl.

The Volume side is adds a fuller and more dramatic look, making my eyelashes look darker with more volume. The formula is also quite simple to apply, but I find that due to this mascara not being waterproof, I end up with black flecks and smudges the longer I get into the day. I think in the end, it's better to invest in a waterproof mascara if you tend to touch your eyes or face and don't have the time to touch-up during the day. 

Overall, this mascara was okay for me, but it's not one I would wear for long durations. The effects didn't wow me, but it did an acceptable job lengthening and adding volume to my lashes. The curl effect isn't as effective but not many mascaras can get my very straight lashes to hold a curl.",5 Jun 2020,Double-Ended Mascara for Different Effects,rcdeman,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"So first let me say that the product DOES do what it says . . . it creates insane volume, length and curl.  I have short, stumpy lashes after years of lash extensions. If you wiggle the volumizing side at the base of your lashes, you get crazy volume.  Then use the lengthening side to get them crazy long.  So why only the 2 stars??  Because within an hour after putting it on I had black smears under my eyes.  That's after using a setting powder.  And I was just sitting on my couch.  Not even out in the summer heat. I cannot imagine what I would look like after being outside in the heat.  So as much as I love the way the product performs on my lashes, I'm going to have to return it.  Which makes me sad because I really did love the way my lashes looked with this product.  Just didn't like the racoon eyes.",5 Jun 2020,"You get tons of volume + length, but . . .",babyd819,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This has done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for my eyelashes in terms of volume and length. I have very short eyelashes and i was VERY much looking forward for this adding length. It has NOT. Ive tried it on 2 different ABH eyeshadow looks and there is ABSOLUTELYno length added . i had to put eyeliner just to give SOMEWHAT of an eyelash look. Revlon mascara adds more length and volume then did. This is a HUGE disappointment Huda.

"I received this as a new product to test and am giving my honest opinion on it.  I love that there are two sides and one of them is a curved brush.  My eyelashes are short and thin and very blonde.  I need all the volume and length I can get.  I also have super sensitive eyes.  This mascara did not active my sensitivities which is AMAZING for me and when used individually with just one wand did not clump.  However when using both wands I was left with a clumpy mess.  Using a eyelash separator between coats helps.  I was very excited about the possibility to use both wands to help with my stumpy little lashes, but will probably not do so due to the clumping.  I did also experience some smearing as my eyes water a bit (although MUCH less with this product than with others I have tried) and this stuff is NOT waterproof.  Also I may be a bit of a dunce because i kept expecting the wand to be in the long part of the mascara and it was the opposite with the product the long part abd I kept getting mascara on my hand.  I guess other products I have used have been the opposite design so that kind of threw me off.  So long story short guys, it's a 50/50 for me.  I'll use it but only for short periods, not for long wearing and only use one side at a time.",5 Jun 2020,Guys it's a 50/50,DSuperawesome,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

For me when I used both sides it got super clumpy on me. I tried each side separately and it worked much better.

This mascara is great! I love that it has the two different sides for volume and then length and curl. I‚Äôve found that using them together gives me the best looking lashes! Specifically going in with the volume first and then curl and length. Something to keep in mind is this is a very ‚Äúwet‚Äù formula and it did get messy while I was applying it. So if you like a dryer formula mascara this is not going to be for you. But the result of the mascara is great!

I used the lengthening side first and then the curling side. I‚Äôd recommend using both sides for sure. It also made my eyelashes a bit clumpy but I think it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt brushed my eyelashes much during quarantine haha.

The pros: I loved the dual-ended packaging, it's a very interesting concept. The wands themselves are specifically made for volume and curl/length. My eyelashes are naturally long but straight, and the curl/length wand was able to curl my eyelashes pretty well! I also tried the volume wand and noticed a pretty big difference immediately!

I used it as was recommended (volume side first followed by length and curl side), and it really delivered. The volume is even more extreme when used with a lash primer first. $27 is a bit steep for a mascara and it does run a bit when it gets wet. For those reasons I bumped it down to 4/5, but overall highly recommend!",4 Jun 2020,"Great for volume and length, but a bit pricy",hanslovo,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"Well, to start off I have ok lashes and has been using Lanc√¥me hypnosis drama mainly.  To make a fair comparison I took 2 picture one with Lanc√¥me Mascara (3 coats) and another with Legit (2 volume and 1 length) and will post for you to compare.  In terms of length and volume, this mascara is not a lot better than Lanc√¥me. In the pic below, the top one is Legit.  My lashes look more separated and feel much lighter.  I always felt I am wearing Mascara but not with Legit.  It did not flake or smudge all 10 hours I wore it.  The price point is definitely competitive for quality since you get 2 full size mascaras. I dropped a star because it is not unique performance.  I would buy again because of the results and light weight.",4 Jun 2020,,vinaM,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I loved the effect of this mascara best when I used the volume side first and then layering with the length/curl side. The lengthening side alone didn‚Äôt give the kind of effect I personally go for in a mascara. The deal breaker for me is that it transferred and quickly.

"I was estastic to be picked to try this product. I had never tried this brand before. I love the double ended wands. I decided to try each end separately first. I really felt the curl and length side was easier to apply and less clumpy. It applied very easily to my lashes. The volume side had a bigger brush and was harder to apply. To me it kind of clumped a little. However, it did deliver on the volume part. It made my lashes appear fuller. Next, I tried both ends after one another. I started with the curl and length and followed with the volume. I don't normally put what seemed like a lot of product on my lashes. It really didn't turn out too bad. I did have to do some cleanup with makeup remover to tone down the clumpy bits. My only big complaint is the smudging under my eyes all day. Please make this waterproof.

"I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes in exchange for my honest opinion. So here is my opinion, I really like the packaging concept and that it has two different ends one for adding volume and one for making eyelashes longer (length) . Overall I wanted to like this product there were some aspects I liked such as having  two different wands the formula was kind of a flop for me very chunky and clumpy . I hope they update the formula . Very thick and when I pulled the wand it was clumpy like it was an old product.

"This definitely lengthened and defined my eyelashes, however I didn‚Äôt see any increase in volume.  Whatever you do, do not apply the volume side after the lengthen and curl side. It clumped so horribly that I looked like a Monster with 4 eyelashes total. Use each side separately or use volume side then curl and lengthen.

"I‚Äôve never used a mascara with two brushes and two formulas before, so this was an exciting mascara to try. The packaging is larger than my usual mascaras, but very sleek and comfortable in hand. I have short lashes and was impressed at how buildable the wax was without getting clumpy. I definitely see the difference in brushes as one adds the product evenly and the other volumizes/curls.

"I received this product from influenster for free to test. My natural lashes are straight and very short and sparse. The packaging felt really nice to hold and it felt like you really got a good grip on the mascara. This did make my lashes long and gave good volume, and the brush on the curl + length side really grabbed even my tiniest lashes. It didn‚Äôt seem to really curl my lashes though, but my lashes only curl when using a curler and waterproof mascara. When I curled my lashes, they went back to straight after applying the mascara so it didn‚Äôt seem super great for curling, but that‚Äôs just my stubborn lashes. I did experience a lot of smudging underneath my eyes but again that might be because my lashes point somewhat down.

"I love dual purpose products, more bang for your buck in my opinion. I really love the volume side, the brush does a great job of adding volume without clumping all the lashes together.

"This mascara is jet black, and the dual-ended feature gives you two plastic-bristled wand options. I use lash growth serum, so my lashes are long but can always use some extra oomph. I like the two options separately, but layering both is too heavy for my lashes, causing the curl to flatten after 20 minutes. I didn't notice any issues with flaking or smudging.

I received this mascara complementary from Influenster. I love this mascara. When purchasing a new mascara you usually have to pick between the two and I am someone who needs both. This mascara offers the best of both! This mascara is more of a wet formula so make sure it is fully dry before you spray any setting spray. Although this is a wet formula it does not clump when adding multiple layers. Once it dries this formula does not budge it will not flake or irritate the eyes.

The volume side gives fluttery volume in 2 coats and the curl side holds your lash curl well. I tried using both sides together and noticed it didn't wear as well and felt a little heavy so I'd recommend using one side or the other,  not both together. The only drawback is that both formulas are not smudge proof and do not wear well for all day wear while I'm at work. Hopefully they'll have a waterproof formula in the future.",31 May 2020,,KrissysMakeup,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I am blown away by this mascara! It is truly amazing. I do not review products too often mostly because I‚Äôm lazy but felt this mascara needed to be acknowledged.

Please excuse the no makeup look - still in lockdown ;) I have long lashes but they lay flat so one cannot see the length until I apply mascara or use a curler.

"A completely fine mascara. First, the shape of the tube is super cute but makes it so incredibly hard to apply this mascara easily. You cannot roll it at all, as it is a diamond shape, and I always roll my mascara when applying it. The lengthening side is fine (plastic wand), but the shape of the tube makes it weird to apply. And then the volumizing side doesn‚Äôt do a whole lot, and the wand is a traditional one. 

Also, this is the opposite of waterproof. Anytime my eyes watered at all I instantly had massive raccoon eyes, and I‚Äôve never gotten that from any other mascara.",31 May 2020,not worth the money,Annietheknitter,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I received this mascara for free in my Voxbox. I would give it 5 stars if it lasted better. Despite that, it's still one of best mascaras I've ever tried, and I tried many. 
I usually apply volume side first and then length and curle, as it was suggested on the card included in my Voxbox. The volume side works great for me, it gives my lashes lots of volume without major clamping. The curle and length side is also good and it does make my lashes longer, but it also makes them look a bit messier. Maybe it happens because I apply it after volume side.
That said, this mascara has one drawback, it transfers under my eyes after a few hours of wearing. I still like this mascara a lot, but it's definitely a big disadvantage.",31 May 2020,One of the best mascaras out there,MariaSt,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I was very much looking forward to this mascara as I have sparse, short lashes. The skin around my eye area is very sensitive so I was looking forward to an enhancement that didn't entail false lashes. I enjoyed watching Huda's description of how she came up with this product and her inspiration behind it. Her live, unedited demo encouraged me to buy the mascara the moment that it went on sale on Sephora Canada.
The mascara lives up to its marketing promises. I found that it volumized my lashes and made them appear longer. The color is the perfect shade of black. However, the formula isn't suitable for my lifestyle, which includes daily yoga practice and humid weather. I found that the mascara had always transferred to my lower eye line at the end of the day.

"Ok so I have heard a lot of things about this mascara but remained skeptical as I usually don‚Äôt but into the hype. I was very pleasantly surprised however when I put this on. I‚Äôll start by talking about the Volume side. This brush is shaped in a way to really give the appearance of significantly more lashes than you actually have. I didn‚Äôt notice any clumping however which is an issue I‚Äôve had previously with other volumizing mascaras. The bristles were soft and didn‚Äôt irritate my eyes at all. Now for the Curl&Length side. This is literally falsies in liquid form. My lashes instantly curled because of how the brush on that side is curved. This is amazing as I‚Äôm always afraid to use eyelash curlers too much as I‚Äôve heard that it weakens eyelashes over time. And the length that got added to my lashes is super impressive. This is due to the fibers that coat the lashes to give that dramatic effect. As for the mascara in general, it is super black which just further pulls attention to the eyes. The packaging is very sleek and easy to hold in my hand. It is thicker than a typical mascara bottle but that isn‚Äôt really an issue. As for removal of the mascara, it came off quite easily with micellar water without excessive rubbing. The only downside to this mascara is I did get some transfer to my upper lid with application but again, super easy to remove so that transfer wasn‚Äôt an issue. Throughout my wear of the mascara it never felt flaky and really just looked like I had put on a pair of falsies. It didn‚Äôt irritate my eyes at all and stayed put! I would strongly recommend this mascara to anyone that wants a dramatic eye look!!!",30 May 2020,Falsies look without the falsies,Sherouk101,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

Its decent. I wouldnt say it's the best I've used. & it does clump easily if using the volumizing side. So you really can't be heavy handed with it. The lengthening side is almost perfect. I'd say my only concern is the dry time. I also applied this in very hot humid climates. Could have been the culprit. Will continue to use. Unsure if I would repurchase at this point. Some drugstore mascaras work better. Giving 4 stars for the lengthening side of the mascara. It really made my lashes look much longer.,30 May 2020,Decent mascara..,chelseajay88,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This mascara is great. I love the versatility of this product. I prefer to use the lengthening and curling side best. I did find the volumizing side to be a little clumpy but I‚Äôm sure with a little work that could be easily resolved.

"very nice mascara if only it didn't clump but, not that bad that you can't  fix it.but, it is  really nice. I like the length and curl side the best. I did it the way they state do volume first then lengthen and curl side I didn't care for that. so everyone's lashes are different so it may look better on others which is a good thing. I have had better, also it does give lift and curl but on me the curl started flipping my lashes forward after about an hour so that is the reason for only 4 stars. I also found out when lashes do that the hair don't like the mascara where your lashes start forming to a forward curl instead of going towards your lid, this mascara made my lashes go outwards . this is a beautiful mascara wish it didn't make my lashes bend forward",30 May 2020,,jdlf,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"Let me preface that I received this as a free the Influenster. I've used the same mascara for years which has been Benefit Roller Lash. When I saw this one included one for dramatic curl it automatically peaked my attention.  Held up well without smearing under my eyes giving me raccoon eyes. Seeing as there are two sides, one for volume and one for curling and length this would be good for someone who can decided which they want more of on a daily basis or both.

"When opening the product it‚Äôs clumpy and you for sure have to be careful when applying. A little creates more of a before/after difference with this. The more layers you put on the more it becomes spider-eyes. I prefer 1-2 light layers with this to get similar results as in the ad. Your eyelashes stick together instead of feathering them out. Not sure if it will make a difference brushing them our first. The volume side has a thicker consistency than the lengthing and curl. The length/curl wand does what it needs to and looks beautiful - the volume gives extra drama. Make sure to wait for it to dry so it doesn‚Äôt smear your makeup or glasses. Fibers dont flake, no smudging, and lasts long. It‚Äôs very black and I like how its a 2 in 1 so that you can mix how you‚Äôd like to wear your lashes. I would personally choose different mascaras on my eyelashes.",29 May 2020,,glossykween,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I‚Äôm kind of surprised but I really liked it. I used it a few times before writing this. I‚Äôll start with the pros: 
No crumbling even though I put on like 4 coats (‚Äúcurl and length‚Äù on top of ‚Äúvolume‚Äù). I went out in rain with no streaking. It was no more difficult to remove than any other high end mascara. It was comfortable and not flaky. I do prefer one brush shape (volume) over the other because I constantly poke myself in the eye with the C&L style brushes lol. Both sides coated my lashes well. The volume one did make my lashes look fuller but be careful because you can look spidery if you put too much of that side. When I used the C&L side over it though, it sort of combed them out and helped with that. My lashes do not curl so I can‚Äôt speak to the curling claims. No mascara helps me with that lol. Also the wands are a bit clunky (short and wide) and it was difficult to get my inner and outer corners. That could defo be because of my eye shape/user error but I did want to warn people. Overall, I would probably not buy it myself, but it is a good mascara. Good formula, good brush.

"I was rooting for this mascara and I am sorry to say that it did not live up to my expectations. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it does what it says it will do, so it does a great job creating length and volume for your lashes, however, it is nothing we haven‚Äôt all probably used before. 

The packaging is great and you are able to get a great grip on the product while applying. I did notice some clumping at times and also would get flakes under my eyes after a few hours of wearing this mascara. 

also, this is a real pain to take off. i used two cleansers and makeup remover pads and i still was finding that their was mascara running from my eyes...so yeah, that was kinda annoying and one of the dealbreakers for me.

This mascara is absolutely amazing! I used the volume side fist then the curl & length. I only needed about 2 coats of each.

"A little goes a long way with this mascara. I played around with this mascara over a few days and found that less is more! I recommend letting the coats dry completely between to prevent clumping. This mascara offers the option for 3 different looks: volume, curl & length or Volume with curl and length. I love the diversity this product offers. I personally preferred using the volume side prior to using the curl and length when combining the two sides together. Otherwise I was pleased wearing both sides alone. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for more volume. I found the volume side to create a more dramatic effect than the curl & length side. I naturally have curly eyelashes and I did not find any dramatic change when using the curl side however Overall I was please with the added length.

"As someone who usually uses two mascaras to get my desired effect, I absolutely love this idea. One side lengthens and curls while the other creates volume and definition. Use them together to level up your look. I‚Äôve used both sides separately and also together but I personally prefer the length and curl side on its own. I find that the volume side makes my lashes clump together into a few ‚Äúmega lashes‚Äù. I‚Äôve had this happen with other mascaras in the past and this issue usually goes away once the formula dries up a bit more. This is definitely more of a wet formula. The length and curl side gives such a pretty effect and is also perfect for my lower lashes because of the slight curve and how thin the wand is. I can easily layer it up to create more natural volume. The actual volume side is a little too dramatic for me but you might like it if you prefer super dark dramatic lashes. I personally like separated and wispy, full looking lashes. My lashes also stayed curled the ENTIRE day. Overall, great idea, nice packaging, but I only see myself using one of the sides. I would recommend this if you want more of a dramatic, super dark, false lash effect.

"I wanted so badly to love this product. I‚Äôve been following Huda on her blog long before her makeup company started. I know she put 5 years into making this mascara and wanted it to be prefect. It might be for some, but for me it is just okay. I like the dual ended product to create different looks. I wore each separately and then together as Huda suggests in the product card. I like the length and curl side, better than the volume, but that is personal preference.  I felt like it left my lashes clumpy and I needed to comb my lashes with a separate wand to try and separate and see-clump. It also dries by the end of the day and leaves mascara flakes under my eyes. Again, I love Huda and wanted this to work so badly.

I love this mascara!! I usually use Chanel le volume and a lengthening one after but this does better than both combined!! Love it‚Äôs 2 for 1 because it‚Äôs saves space in my makeup bag.

"Never have I ever used a product and got the same results as the picture on the packaging shows, until NOW! My lashes looked identical to the picture on the box! At first, I was worried because I had never used a fiber formula mascara before, but it was so easy to apply. I love that there are two sides; one for volume and one for curl & length. The brushes are nicely shaped and silicone like in material. It‚Äôs a very clean mascara, meaning it doesn‚Äôt get all over your eyelids or the tube itself during application. It‚Äôs a little pricey at $27, but you do get two full size mascaras in one, so it‚Äôs not a bad value at all. The results were amazing; my lashes were full, long, slightly curled and oh so black! I‚Äôll definitely be purchasing this in the future!",28 May 2020,Legit Lashes is Legit,JessieJayyy,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I was pleasantly surprised by the Huda Beauty Legit Lashes mascara. I‚Äôm used to only using the TooFaced Better Than Sex mascara and I thought this was comparable. I used both the volume and curling sides of the mascara and found that I didn‚Äôt noticed a huge difference with the curling/lengthening side but I liked the overall look! Would purchase in the future.,28 May 2020,,mcw1322,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"Overall, this mascara does what a mascara should. Using both ends amplifies there dramatic effect (1st pic). The black color makes the eyes pop, and the formula isn‚Äôt sticky. However, because the result is that your lashes look more dramatic and not natural, this is not a mascara I will buy myself. I prefer the natural results that the Glossier Lash Slick or the Etude House Lash Curl Perm Fix give. However, if you want a dramatic look, this could be a good option for you. 

Pros:
- The color is not gray, and is a true black. 
- The formula dries pretty dry, so setting powder won‚Äôt stick to your lashes during touch ups. 
- The two types of formula are nice, and there is a considerable difference upon application between the two. The volumizing side makes your lashes much thicker; the curl + lengthening side really only lengthens but doesn‚Äôt add much volume (see 2nd pic).
- The formula does not smudge too much. After 12+ hours of wear, the smudging is minimal. 

Cons:
- The applicator for the curl + lengthen applies worse. The applicator picks up too much product, which makes it really easy to smudge the product on the skin around your eyes during application. 
- The formula for the curl + lengthen side lengthens about the same amount that the volumizing side does. Not a huge difference. 
- The formula is not ‚Äúclumpy,‚Äù but it does NOT leave your lashes looking natural. If you‚Äôre looking for a mascara that will give you a natural look, in which the tips of your eyelashes are pointed like natural hairs are, this is not your mascara. The ends of your lashes will be blunt if you use both formulas (see 1st pic). The curl + lengthen side used on its own gives comparatively more natural results (see 2nd pic). 
- NOT waterproof. This will definitely come off with a little water exposure. But, this means that removing the mascara at the end of the day is easy. I found that the best way is to use a good gel cleanser and massage gently around the eyes to remove.",28 May 2020,"Good mascara for dramatic looks, not natural looks",Jennifer227,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I received this mascara for free from Influenster to review. That being said, I was somewhat impressed with it in certain areas. The volume side works amazingly on my sparse lashes and makes them look full. The curl and lengthen side is very nice, but I feel the curl part is a little bit lack-luster. It lengthens well but even after curling my lashes myself, the mascara doesn‚Äôt seem to make it more curled looking at all. It‚Äôs super light on my lashes, doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wearing any mascara which I love! It also washes off easily so you don‚Äôt need to rub your eyes hard at all. The only downfalls I‚Äôve found are the curling didn‚Äôt meet expectations and there does seem to be a mild amount of flaking after a few hours. Personally, for the price, I wouldn‚Äôt expect to have any flaking that quickly. I‚Äôm definitely enjoying using this for quick trips out and about, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to wear it all day with the amount of flaking there is for me. I feel like I‚Äôd have raccoon eyes after a day of work wearing this mascara. Overall, it‚Äôs an alright product but I don‚Äôt think I would purchase it once this tube runs out.",28 May 2020,"Falls Below Expectations, Not Horrible",SavanahJay,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I  highly recommend using both ends, starting with the voluminous side, then the lengthening and curl.

"I received this product from Influenster to test out and review. I used it for several days to get a good solid opinion before leaving this review.
Alright, neat concept- 1 mascara, 3 looks. Its double sided- one side adds fantastic curl and leaves lashes incredibly thin. Perfect for more natural looks. The other side is for lengthening and volume. This was my favorite- adds decent length and thickens. The 3 rd option is using both sides together, the curl side first, LET IT DRY, then apply the lengthening side. The result is bold. However, its easy to make lashes far too think- be careful with how many layers you apply.
Useful information...(positives)
- after 12 hrs, my lashes looked almost the same as right after application.
- no smudging, even during 80 degree weather 
- I noticed no flakes under my eyes which is common with many lengthening mascaras.
- removal was simple. I used my daily cleansing balm and it melted away with barely any effort.
Negatives...
- you need to be extremely careful with how many layers you use or you will end up with spider leg lashes.
- takes some experimenting to get it figured out.
Would I buy this mascara? Probably not, as I'm a loyal user of another kind. Would i recommend this to others? In most circumstances, yes. For people who are extremely picky with their mascaras, I more than likely wouldnt recommend.
All in all, its a nice mascara. It took me a few days to figure out how I liked it and to be able to achieve the look I was after, but once I did I was pleased. I do love the options! Its nice having one tool that creates a few different lash looks. The price? Very fair and expected when it comes to nicer mascaras.",28 May 2020,"Hudas Clever New Mascara. 3 looks, 1 product.",KtBeauty87,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I really loved that this mascara came with two wands and two formulas! I used the volume first and seen the way it immediately darkened and lengthened my lashes then I used the curl and length for a better curl and length in my lashes! The only downfall of this product was that it dries fast so when switching from volume to curl and length you need to make it quick because your lashes will dry out quickly.

"There was a lot of hype for this mascara, between the advertisements, YouTube videos and social media content. I have straight, Asian lashes and curl is very important for me when it comes to the efficacy of a mascara. All of Huda's photos looked like they made her lashes curl, thicken, and lengthen but it definitely does not hold a curl (I do curl my lashes prior to application). It does a decent job at lengthening but it didn't really thicken my lashes either.

I really like the packaging a lot it's cute. regarding the mascara it's really nice to have a double sided one you can throw in you bag and go because if you want dramatic lashes use both sides together but if you want more simple easy going lash look only use ether or side.

If you‚Äôre looking for long, full lashes, this is the mascara for you! I‚Äôve worn both mascara sides separately and combined, whichever way you wear it, your lashes will be volumized! Also, a little goes a long way, I only used one coat of the volume side in the picture below. The only suggestion I have is to make the mascara waterproof, because my under eye would start to get dark toward the end of the day. I highly recommend it!

"I wore this the first time using both formulas together and after 8 hours there was no flaking. However my first thoughts on it was that this made my lashes very clumpy and bunched together.Despite all that it didn‚Äôt smudge,and when it came time to remove it, I found an oil based makeup remover worked best, otherwise you‚Äôll sit there for 15+ minutes.  The formulas alone are a complete different story, alone they didn‚Äôt clump my lashes. The volume side provides fullness needed for thin lashes like mine. The Curl & Length side was more impressive, the fibers in it lengthen the lashes without adding any weight and staying very natural. After 12 hrs some fibers did flake but nothing that couldn‚Äôt be brushed off. I‚Äôve added pictures of what this did for me. Final thoughts: This mascara does exactly what it says, it adds volume curl and length. I have lashes on the thinner side and tend to be very picky with my mascaras, but I love the two formulas Huda Beauty used and will continue to use this.

I love the packaging and the smoothly gliding formula (no flakes either!), but I found the performance pretty average on my difficult to work with lashes.

"I received this product free from Influenster and am not loving it. It has 2 sides which is a cool concept, but I was hoping for better results. I prefer the volume side over the curl & length side. I found the curl and length side made my lashes look too separated and didn‚Äôt really do much to curl them. The volume side coated them well, but I‚Äôve had better results with other products.",26 May 2020,Just OK,lisa3247,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I received this product from Influenster.

I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like this mascara as much as I would. I didn‚Äôt believe that the different formulas/brushes would work on my eyelashes and that it would all be the same for me. But, it worked for me! I‚Äôve been using it every day since I got it, I go more for the volumizing side since I like a more subtle look with my eyelashes, but the lengthening side does work too! It‚Äôs just not my preference.

I‚Äôll be buying this once I run out, I almost never spend more than $10 on mascara, but this one is truly worth it!",26 May 2020,,potsexuals,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This mascara honestly shocked me at how good it was! The dual end brush has one for length and one for volume and each one is awesome separately but when you use them both WOW my lashes have never looked so good. They were so long and voluminous I got compliments on them all day long. Definitely will be purchasing this once my tube is finished.

Great product! I must say I enjoy having the dual brush ends since it allows me to go for different looks! It I want only volume I can stick with one brush or if I want a lighter look and just want some length then I stick with the other brush! It‚Äôs an even better looking using both brushes.,26 May 2020,Great product!,victoriaasoares,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I genuinely enjoyed this product! I love how it made my lashes look after layering both products and I could tell that each side had different benefits. My lashes look thicker, fuller, and much more noticeable. My only issue is that the mascara itself is bulky and hard to hold because of its shape, and it takes up a ton of space in my makeup bag. That‚Äôs just my personal preference; it‚Äôs definitely unique, and there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with the formula, I love it!",26 May 2020,A great product to try!,aliciawala,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This is not a mascara that I would purchase again. The quality should be way better since it costs $27.,26 May 2020,,PreciousDragon,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
Y‚Äôall! This stuff is legit! I used to the length side first and with one coat it made such a difference. I used the volume side after and there was no clumping!! Also I apparently have very oily eyelids and that makes everything crease and smudge..not with this stuff! It stayed put almost 12 hours and would have stayed longer had I not washed my face. I usually think most mascaras are all the same but I was blown away with this one!,26 May 2020,,ahicks235,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

This mascara is amazing. I‚Äôm very picky about my mascara and I‚Äôve only been using this one for a few days but I love it! I use the volume side and then the curl and lengthen side. It makes my eyelashes super long and thick. There is also no need to curl them before as the mascara does that. It also stays on all day long and they look just as good right before bed as they did in the morning. The other day my mom even thought I was wearing fake lashes!

"Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm quite surprised how much I like this mascara. I‚Äôm super picky when choosing mascaras. This isn‚Äôt quite clumpy, but the right amount of length and volume. It‚Äôs very black, lasts awhile, no flakes. This is a super wet formula, which typically all new tubes are, so apply with caution till it dries out more. This is also a little hard to take off at night, which proves it‚Äôs staying power. It didn‚Äôt give me my favorite look of separation, nor did the two wands really stand out to me as being different. Overall, a good mascara.",26 May 2020,Pleasantly surprised,wiiah54,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I surprisingly really liked this product. Typically I do not care for the flexible plastic type brushes and prefer the bristles that are more like a traditional spooly. The mascara when paired together really do add quite a bit of volume and density to the lashes in appearance to where I no longer wear eyeliner. I will say I do not notice any curling from the lengthening and curling side of the mascara. I also use the curling side after the volume side while it is still wet on my lashes.,26 May 2020,,trustedresale,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I've personally never used any HudaBeauty products so was super excited to try the new mascara she came out with. At first, I was a little intimidated because of the wand being a bit on the bulky side but soon found no issues when applying the mascara. The formula is very well made and loving the matte black! I tried both the volume and length&curl side. Even just using the volume side, I was getting extreme length! Pairing the two together really gave me that falsies look we all love. I'm impressed!",26 May 2020,,TristinaLea,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This mascara is actually really great. I don‚Äôt typically go for two sided mascaras due to how clunky they tend to be but this one is worth it. The curl and length side is absolutely stunning and makes lashes look so long and defined. I‚Äôm not as big of a fan of the volume side but it still looks nice. Even combined they look great and don‚Äôt turn into spider lashes.,26 May 2020,,nickeldelancey,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I love the overall idea of this product. It‚Äôs nice to have multiple brush options in a streamlined format. Upon first application, I liked how black it was. I tried each brush on one eye to compare the differences. You can see a slight difference in volume/length between the two, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it is super significant. Both sides were pretty, separating, and didn‚Äôt seem to clump. Of the two, I felt like I was more drawn to the ‚Äúcurl and length‚Äù side, which is unusual because I typically focus more on volume and don‚Äôt typically love curved applicators. But the volume side brush was somewhat scratchy to my eye. I have sensitive eyes and it didn‚Äôt seem to irritate, but the plastic bristles are a bit harsh and you can definitely feel it at the base of your lashes when you apply, so use carefully. 

Overall, I am pleased with the product and will continue to use. If my opinions change as I do further testing, I will report back! I am interested to see how they layer over one another.

"WOW. It's like, false lashes in a tube. This is one of those mascaras that the moment I put it on, I was kind of afraid to blink because I might take flight! 
The formula is amaaazing. It isn't too dry that it immediately dries the moment you do one swipe, but it doesn't stay wet forever. It makes it very easy to do the two different coats/brushes without it clumping. I do have to be a little careful with the volume side and only apply one coat instead of brush sixteen times out of habit, to keep my lashes apart.

This product is amazing. You can definitely use either end or both together. I‚Äôve found myself using both. I typically wear lashes every day but I love this for days I decide not to. Its easily buildable. Definitely better than the Better Than Sex mascara.

I received this product in a complimentary Influenster VoxBox and it‚Äôs one of the best products I have ever used. I have been using products for both length and volume for a while and this is one of the only mascaras that I have found that genuinely leaves a nice look. It definitely makes your eyes pop! The only issue I found with it is that is incredibly difficult to remove even with eye makeup remover. While I‚Äôve found this to be great for long time wear but it is a pain for removal at the end of the day.,25 May 2020,,asleo117,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This product was very underwhelming. The curl & length did neither of what it was supposed to do and weighed my lashes down. All the volume side did was lengthen my lashes slightly. I haven‚Äôt used the curl & volume sides together just because I already know that it‚Äôs going to be clumpy and weigh my lashes down like crazy.

"Normally I don‚Äôt like double wand mascaras but this one actually works well together. You can build it up with either side.

The curl and lengthen side didn‚Äôt curl particularly much but lengthened nicely, and worked really well on my lower lashes. It imparted a very delicate look. However, it was a but clumpy. The volume side was much better for me, as it lengthened and volumized. It functioned just like a good standard mascara. Layering both brought good length and volume, but it was still too clumpy for me.

"My lashes are fairly long and not very curly. I tried every combination of this mascara, first trying out each end individually then a mix of them both, like shown in the video. The curl and length side is truly awful, clumps lashes like no other and adds NO length or curl to my lashes. The wand on the length and curl side is awful when used it barely gets in the lashes and just brushes over them making lashes very clumpy to the point where it is impossible to fix. The volume side is ok and makes my lashes look separated and significantly longer, however the same effect can be gained by using the Too Faced Better than sex mascara which is significantly cheaper and works way better. One other thing I noticed with the volume side is that the wand is bendy and therefore makes it incredibly hard to get to the base of my lashes. When I tried both ends of the mascara my lashes looked like clump city, ok to start off with when I just used the volume side then when I added the length and curl side everything went downhill, incredibly clumpy with no length nor curl. I do not recommend this product, try either the Too Faced Better than sex mascara or MILK mascara instead. Hated this mascara so very much!!",25 May 2020,Theres better out there,Pedikeens,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I tend to like a more natural mascara look and this product gives me the option for a more natural look with the lengthening and a more dramatic look with the volumizing!

"Let me preface this by saying I have VERY oily eyelids, so most non-waterproof and even waterproof formulas don‚Äôt work for me. For this review, I only curled my lashes but did not apply lash primer or use a setting spray.

This formula is very wet - both brushes came out covered in it which made it harder to manage on my lashes. That being said, even though it went on heavy, it still held my curl nicely - just beware it‚Äôll be a messy application so you‚Äôll need to be careful. After 8 hours, I was surprised I didn‚Äôt have that bad of raccoon eyes which is almost always inevitable for me, so that was great - I‚Äôve had worse raccoon eyes with waterproof formulas. For a fiber-based formula, this had very little flaking and did not get in my eyes at all. 

I did Length then Volume on my left eye, and Volume then Length on my right eye. The left came out infinitely better, so I suggest using Length first. Length‚Äôs brush is so nice to use, but take that with a grain of salt as I tend to like elongating mascaras better than volume.

Overall I‚Äôm really impressed considering my criteria. One star is knocked off considering how goopy my brushes were coming out, but that could just be a fluke.

"I love the overall concept and design of this mascara. It definitely gave good volume to my lashes when I used both sides, just beware of caking on too much because it can get clumpy fast. I preferred the curling side over the volume side because of the clumping issues, but I know many will enjoy the options it provides. There was no fallout by the end of the day, which was great.

I love this mascara. The product stayed on all day and didn't smudge at all. It also doesn't make my lashes feel crunchy and doesn't clump.

After seeing the type of brush each side has I didn't think I was going to like it, in the past spikey brushes would give me clumpy lashes. Not this one!! It separates my lashes and gives me insane length and a curl that lasts ALL DAY. I can say it doesnt give as much volume as others I've tried but it's the perfect amount for every day wear, it's also a more wet formula but give it a minute it dry down.

I use both ends of the mascara, starting with the lengthening one. If I'm going for a more natural look, I'll only use the lengthening one. My lashes are always hard to curl so I have to curl them before and after I apply the mascara. I think this mascara somewhat helps the lashes stay lifted. It also made my bottom lashes look amazing!

"Disappointed. I LOVE Huda and her products, and I was so excited to try this mascara! I am a mascara addict. I compare all mascaras to my HG Thrive Liquid Lash Extensions (the best out there). There was so much hype for Huda‚Äôs mascara, that I was certain I‚Äôd love it. I applied the mascara as instructed by Huda. Lashes looked decent. However, 30 min after applying, I had the WORST raccoon eyes possible. I wiped it away and went on with my dad. Another hour later, more raccoon eyes!! This stuff transfers so badly to the under eye area. Thank goodness I‚Äôm working from home because I looked hideous. I do not recommend this product, but I love all other Huda products.

When I first read that the ends were to be used together I was a bit nervous it would get super clumpy. I started with the volume side first and honestly I loved it as is! It gave my eyes a bit more pop! When I added the curl & length it did seem to feel more dry together so I wish it was a bit smoother. But overall the two would be totally fine on their own and I‚Äôll continue to use it especially for the volume!,24 May 2020,Loving the Volume,Kaylaen,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I received this mascara complimentary from @influenster for testing purposes. I found that if you get the volume side too close to your lash line the brush is very sharp and prickly on your eye lid. It was uncomfortable to apply close to the lash line which I like to do to get really defined and separated lashes. I tried both sides on their own, and wearing it combining both together. I found that while the mascara adds length & volume to make my lashes stand out more, when applying it, the mascara went on very clumpy making my lashes stick together rather than separating them. I did however like the brush on the curl side better - and found it worked well on my lower lashes, and caused less clumpiness there than on the top lid. 


I also liked that it barely flakes off. I have a lot of trouble with mascara as I will often find dark raccoon circles under my eyes within an hour of putting it on. But this one stayed in place really nicely. And was difficult to take off too - which to me is a sign of a mascara that will really stay in place. I found I had to wash my face and eyes with soap and water first, and then go over my eyes again with eye makeup remover on cotton to fully remove the mascara. 

Overall, from farther away I liked how it looked and how defined my lashes looked, but didn‚Äôt love the application itself.",24 May 2020,Like but didn‚Äôt love,Gidget28,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I first used the lengthening side and then the volume and my lashes looked so full and so long! I've never seen them like this. I like the dual ended packaging because you get two mascaras in one. I had it on for about 8 hours and my lashes did not budge or smudge! My only complaint is that it was a little hard to take off with micellar water but a little bit of an oil based makeup remover did the trick!",24 May 2020,,NoorHadi,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I was very skeptical about this mascara but after trying it I‚Äôm in love! The price is a bit high but if you think of it as getting 2 mascaras in one then it‚Äôs not that bad.

"I got this mascara from influenster, but I really enjoy it so far. The lengthening side is more natural while when I wore the volumizing side my mom said it looked like I had fake eyelashes on. The only downside is I feel there is not a lot of product and they‚Äôre sized like travel/mini mascaras. Also when I put it on the design makes it a little tricky to apply and it can get on my eyelids. Overall 4/5",23 May 2020,,Mairs21,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"After using this mascara my lashes looked so much more defined and longer! I like the dual-ended packaging and how you have both brushes at your fingertips. I love the darkness of the formula and how lightweight it feels on the lashes.

I believe that there is a bit of a learning curve with this mascara so I wouldn‚Äôt first try it on the day of a big event!

"I have been looking for a mascara to LOVE for a really long time. There are many formulas that I like (Milk Makeup Kush mascara, Lanc√¥me Hypnose, Marc Jacobs), but nothing that seriously wows me. I have very dark, think but stick straight lashes. I usually prefer getting lash lifts but haven‚Äôt been able to do that lately due to quarantine. I saw Huda post about this mascara and was intrigued and figured why not try it. I was definitely wowed by it. 

Per the instructions, you could use either formula alone or use the volumizing formula first when using both. The brushes are unique and very flexible which allowed you to get every lash. When trying this, I did not even curl my lashes because I wanted to see how it worked. Usually, I have to aggressively curl my lashes because of how straight they are. This mascara, while thick, did not clump at all. I followed the instructions and used the volumizing formula and applied the length and curl formula while the volumizing formula was still wet. My lashes looked amazing! The bonus was this formula really did work at curling my lashes and holding the curl all day. 

I think the bonus to this mascara is that there are 2 different formulas. Some people may see that as a flaw, but different looks call for different lashes and you have more of an ability to customize here. I definitely recommend this product!",23 May 2020,LEGIT!,luckynic13,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I‚Äôve played around with this mascara for a few days in order to give an accurate review and to see if there are any ways to make it wear better. There is a trick to it, which is that you first have to apply the curling and lengthening formula, and then you apply the volume formula. Any other combination, or just one of the formulas, produced sub par results. If done correctly, you get good looking lashes that last all day without raccoon eyes. However, it gets four stars because it‚Äôs definitely not the best mascara I‚Äôve used. I‚Äôm not sure why two formulas were necessary to achieve this look, either.

"I recently received this mascara in my influenster box. First impression of the mascara is the dual ended wand. Each wand to target a desired look. The one wand is targeted for ‚Äúvolume‚Äù and the other wand for ‚Äú curl & length‚Äù. * I did Curl my eyelashes before applying mascara, like I normally do before apply.* I first used the curl & length wand for my first coat starting from the base of my lashes. Immediately I did notice how the mascara coated every lash. Then I went in with ‚Äúvolume‚Äù wand and used it from the base to the end of my lashes and specifically targeted the base of my lashes, where I wanted the most volume. My overall first impression of the mascara was very pleasantly surprised with how well it worked when I first applied. 
By the end of the day I did have some flakes under my eyes and the mascara transferred/ran a tiny bit, but I somewhat expected that since today was a hot muggy day and I was outside a good amount.

I enjoy what both sides of this mascara do for my lashes individually. However, you have to be careful when combining them because it can get clumpy quite quickly.

"I received this mascara in the mail from Influenster and Immediately applied it!! 

Pros:
- it provided an amazing amount of both volume, curl, and length. It does exactly what it says it will in just one coat which is perfect for a dramatic look!
- it‚Äôs not clumpy whatsoever and you lashes remain spread out 

Cons:
- the mascara stays wet after you apply it, so you have to let it dry a few seconds before continuing. 
- the applicator on the volume end is thick (not pointy) so it can be difficult to reach the lashes near the inner eye without leaving a mess. 
- the packaging took some getting used to. The wand is in the center, so you have to hold the end of the side you want in your hand as you untwist from the center Otherwise you will pull the bottle of mascara instead of the wand. 

Overall this is a great mascara if you‚Äôre looking for volume and length. While I personally think it‚Äôs a bit dramatic for everyday wear, I love it for special events! Just use caution when you‚Äôre applying!!",22 May 2020,Great Mascara - Use Caution!,mfonseca20,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This mascara is my new favorite! I have almost no lashes and it does wonders!! Especially when you do the volume side then the curl/lengthen side. It is a wetter formula but omg it‚Äôs wonderful.,22 May 2020,,Mel15641,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

at first i didn‚Äôt think i was going to like this mascara but the more i used it the more i liked it! it was a little clumpy at first but the use of the second wand swiped them away. it made my natural lashes look long and full like falsies without the use of a million coats and the struggle of using a curler! my only complaint is that the wand handle (since there are two) is a little big and hard to maneuver but once you get past that it‚Äôs quite easy!,22 May 2020,like wearing falsies!,ashlyndearing,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I received this mascara as a free gift from Influenster to try out! I definitely love the packaging and the two sides different brushes to lengthen and volumize.

This mascara is great!! It wears all day long with no flakiness. I like how it has two different wands to use so you choose your preference. This makes it unique from other mascaras.

"I received this mascara for free from Influenster. I was super excited to try this mascara! Before even putting it on, I felt that it was going to be difficult to apply because of the long handle (whereas most mascaras have a short handle). That would be my only complaint about this. Aside from that, I absolutely love this mascara!! Pictures with nothing on my lashes, no curl and then with one coat of both sides of this mascara, also no curl. Excited to try a couple more coats for my next night out! This also didn‚Äôt flake during the day, and looked just as good at the end of the day!",22 May 2020,,chelsyy5678,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I finally received these in the mail from Influenstwr and put it on almost immediately. I have shoet eyelashes and hate having to buy so many different kinds to find the right one. I love the way it has two in one and especially love the curl and length part. It really did lengthen my short eyelashes and look and feel great. I really like their bristles too. All-around a good mascara.,22 May 2020,Great,weenyjong,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I want to start by saying I received this for free from influenster for reviewing purposes. The first picture is just with the curling and lengthening side and the second picture is with both formulas. I am the kind of person who needs a waterproof mascara or my lashes will immediately fall down. So I wasn‚Äôt really expecting anything from this but I love the brand and was excited to try this anyways. I also have what I refer to as a good eye and bad eye. Meaning one of my eyes has good lashes and the other I have to really work with. This was no different and I would say that I had to work a bit extra on both eyes to try to get this to work which was expected because it‚Äôs not waterproof. I did eventually kind of make it work which is why I gave it 3 stars. I could do without the volume side I didn‚Äôt think it gave me too much volume but I did notice the curl and lengthen side did exactly what it says. I also noticed that when I let the mascara dry and curled it that my lashes held better. But overall I wouldn‚Äôt purchase this personally it‚Äôs just not my cup of tea. But if your lashes already have a curl or can hold a curl well then I would absolutely recommend this for you!,22 May 2020,Not for pin straight lashes,Nickybee12,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I received this mascara as a free sample from Influenster. I loved the packaging , very sleek and interesting. The mascara was great. I tried it on, and from just one coat it has a pretty dramatic effect. I liked what it did to my lashes .",22 May 2020,,Catuli,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I really like this! I usually don‚Äôt believe lengthening mascaras do much but make your eyelashes look like little pins but this gave me a really nice look!

Didn‚Äôt transfer at all which I‚Äôm really happy about!,22 May 2020,PRETTY!,DiaT,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I got this product for free from Influenster to review. I was super excited to try this because I‚Äôve heard so many great things about HUDA beauty products. I thought that the mascara did a really good job of lengthening the lashes. However I don‚Äôt think it did anything for volume. I had to layer it with another mascara that i use most in order to get a good amount of volume.,22 May 2020,,ajrq,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I got this mascara in the mail today, and I immediately took it out of the box, swiped it onto my lashes using both sides. At first I was skeptical because I hadn‚Äôt curled my lashes before hand or anything. Let me tell you, I was not prepared for the volume, length AND curl it provides. Holy crap, and now I am upset I never knew this existed until now. I will definitely be a repeat customer and I 100% recommend this to anyone who feels like they just aren‚Äôt getting what they really want from their current mascara. You can also use each side independently for a lighter every day look, but uh, we all know we all secretly want those bombshell lashes no matter what time of day lol",22 May 2020,New favorite!,mslolafroufrou,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I was super excited when I received the new legit lashes mascara from Huda Beauty. I've never been one to use false lashes so when she came out with this I became intrigued. It really lengthens and curks the lashes as it says. The price is good since it's a 2 in 1, I used the volume side them applied lengthening and curl side. The only thing I hope they add to this is other colors as it's a really dark black and sometimes when I want a no makeup look I want just a tad lighter. Other than that I truly love it! Looks great, eyes pop and no need for falsies!!",22 May 2020,It's a great product that I will be reaching for,Sheli143,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I don‚Äôt know if I believe the other reviews on here. The brushes were not great, the formula was maybe okay, I do love Huda and her brand, but, this mascara will be going back. My eyes looked spidery, and smeared later in the day, and that‚Äôs not usually an issue with me.  I‚Äôm sad I didn‚Äôt love this",22 May 2020,,LeahB40,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
It's a great product especially if you want that falsies look. I already have thick eyelashes so I used the lengthen and curl most of the time. My eyelashes don't curl on there own and this made them look natural and separated. The volumizing side I used with this for when I new I was taking photos. I have had no problems with it running or transferring. You need a strong cleansing balm to get it off without irritating your eyes from rubbing. It is completely black. It is an almost perfect mascara,22 May 2020,Bold,Madedog4,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
Y‚Äôall.... I‚Äôm not one for luxury but this mascara is awesome! I am all for volume and length and this certainly doesn‚Äôt disappoint! There are two brushes two formulas and overall AMAZING!

I received this product for free but I would buy it for myself! I love the length and curl side normally and add the volume side when I want a little more dramatic look. The product doesn‚Äôt clump together and really makes my short lashes look MUCH different!,22 May 2020,,lucydm,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This mascara works great! I love that you get two options for brushes. Depending on how ‚Äòglam‚Äô you want your makeup you can go all out with your lashes!

"Thank you #Hudabeauty!! This mascara makes me want to cheat on my falsies as the box says. Literally, makes me feel as glamorous and I do when I put falsies on. The dual ended brush is a MUST. I have long lashes but they are not curly and they are not thick, this mascara definitely lives up to its name. My lashes looked fuller, curled, and lengthened because.. WHO DOESN‚ÄôT WANT LONGER LASHES? I absolutely recommend everyone try this!! I‚Äôm already thinking of purchasing one to have enough and not run out. The color too is impeccable. It‚Äôs dark dark so it really eventuates your lashes and your eyes all together. Really makes even the simplest face beat look ready for a night out. Out of a 10 id give this mascara a 100!!!

this is simply the BEST mascara i have ever used. my eyelashes are so defined and curled! the two different brushes truly makes such a difference and creates a lot of volume for my eyelashes. they look like they have to be extensions but they‚Äôre just my natural eyelashes. it‚Äôs also great because my eyelashes don‚Äôt feel stiff or crusty.,22 May 2020,the very best!!!,toric1822,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I love the volume and depth that this mascara gave me. I applied both sides, doing volume first, and absolutely was amazed by the length and darkness of my eyelashes. I loved them so much! And then I learned that it was not waterproof. If you know it will rain, be in the pool, or cry during the day be warned! Other than that, it was fantastic and I love how my eyelashes look when I wear it.",22 May 2020,,Kristen35,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"Overall, I was satisfied with the final look of my lashes. I used the curl and lengthening side first, then went back over with the volumizing side. I normally prefer bristle mascara brushes, but these did a nice job depositing the product. Some issues I had with the mascara were that the dual brush design and the shape of the mascara tube were a little clunky and it made application a little difficult. It held up nicely through the day and I didn‚Äôt notice any smudges or flaking off. I don‚Äôt think I would purchase this on my own, but I will use it up! Definitely a product for Huda Beauty fans.",22 May 2020,"Good mascara, but not for me",alexells,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This mascara is AMAZING! I received it as a free sample and tried it for the first time and I was amazed. Live the fact that you get two different wands that give you great results. I used the curling one first for some definition and then did the volume one on top and my lashes looked really good.,22 May 2020,Love everything about it,wilotiago,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
This mascara is one of kind and a great idea. Having a double ended brush this way is unique and I love it. The wants are attached it‚Äôs the tubes you remove which is very different from most double mascaras. You have a Volumizing Side and a lengthening side. If you want to make your lashes dramatic and look like false lashes this is a great mascara to use. It gives you that extra fullness while making your lashes appear longer and fuller at the same time. I like that it has the two sides so you can make your eyes look dramatic or look natural. I am a major fan of Huda beauty products and this is another great item. I highly recommend it.,22 May 2020,Such a great mascara to finish your look!,clarckson,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

Im always on the hunt for a good mascara as it is the item I use the most - I use it every day. 
I like that after I curl my lashes the curl holds up with this mascara on and I think it did add volume to my lashes. 
I have light eyelashes and this was a true blackout black. Love it. It did not smudge and was easy to take off in the shower with my face wash. 
I would definitely give it a go.",21 May 2020,Great volume,EllieAT,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I applied the volume side then the lengthening side. I noticed a dramatic difference in how my eyelashes looked. One caveat is that too much of the product comes out on the brush, so it does require some maneuvering and brushing the clumps out. I like that it gives you two options - volume and lengthening.",21 May 2020,,cathyyy,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I am extremely impressed with this mascara! I have a hard time finding the perfect mascara that gives length and volume and especially for my short lashes. I put on the volume side first and I liked it, but it looked to be about the same result as I get with my current mascara. Then I added the length and curl and...WOW!!!! Both sides together completely changed my mind.
I currently use a primer and mascara so I am having to spend over $45 for both. This mascara gives even better results for $27. The formula of this mascara is also really good and doesn‚Äôt clump. Definitely worth trying!",21 May 2020,,LT102004,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I really love this product. It definitely defines my lashes. I already have fairly long lashes so I‚Äôve been looking for something to give it volume. I used it today and it really does the job.

"I have never found a mascara that works better for me. I feel that both ends live up to their promise and deliver what they say they will. When I combine the lengthening and volumizing sides, I almost feel as if I‚Äôm wearing false lashes due to the results. I have not had any problems with this mascara budging throughout the day. The only problem with this mascara for me is the price, but the results that it delivers makes the price much more bearable.",21 May 2020,,simple4182,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I‚Äôve always had trouble finding a mascara that can lengthen my lashes and curl my lashes and feel light but I haven‚Äôt had any luck till now! This is by far the darkest mascara I‚Äôve ever had as well! With the double side applicator it makes things so much easier and you can choose how exactly you want your mascara to look that day.

‚Ä¢The curl & lengthen end might be my favorite. It definitely gave more of a natural look, that I‚Äôm a big fan of. 
‚Ä¢Together they were the best of both worlds!!! I would definitely recommend applying the lengthen end first and then the volume for the best results.

"First off the packaging on this mascara is sleek and luxurious.  This to me makes it extremely worth the price if aesthetically pleasing things make you happy.

Second I was at first skeptical of the double sided mascara and was honestly questioning why one would need two brushes but after using it my opinion changed.  The length and curl is perfect for an everyday look because it separates and adds volume to the lashes without looking overdone. The  Legit Volume side is perfect for some night looks or days when you feel like a boss.  

The formula is great and does not flake so its an excellent candidate for whatever purpose you might need it.",21 May 2020,Life Changing,juliahuth77,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
I recieved this mascara for free from Influenster to try and give my opinion. I was so impressed after applying to just 1 eye!! I used the Volume first followed by a coat of Curl and Lenghten. My lashes are full and have great definition and volume. I really like that you have two formulas in one tube and you can layer to see which works best for you. It dried nicely and doesn't feel cakey or dry. I am excited about this mascara and will definitely purchase it when mine is gone!!,21 May 2020,,gigigirl86,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

I‚Äôve prob tried almost all mascaras from Sephora since thats the only thing I never leave my house without. This is one of THE worst! This clumps so bad and my drugstore mascara works better at lengthening than this. The double ended wands are more of a hassle tbh. After 3 days of using it the the mascara go so sticky. These other reviews seem fake. I had to send it back. The only reason I gave is 2 star is b/c the mascara was super pigmented but nonetheless the worst mascara I‚Äôve tried from Sephora so far.

"After looking the mascara I was super impressed with the design, sleekness, and overall packaging. The triangle style tube makes it easy to grip and use. My eyelashes are in the longer side already but the curl and length side made them the longest I‚Äôve seen. Only issue is that a lot comes out on the wand so it was hard for me to figure out when enough was enough. The volume side definitely works and I could tell a difference in the formulas not just wand design. Volumizing mascara always tends to make my lashes clumpy and this was not an exception. However after playing with how much I apply, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that less is more and you don‚Äôt need a lot to make your lashes look amazing. I do prefer the lengthening and curl side over the volumizing side. I‚Äôm not totally sold on the volume wand just based on my past experiences with volumizing mascara so that is why I went with 4 stars.",21 May 2020,,Stepherlac,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I would like to start by saying I received this product for free from Influenster to test and give my honest feedback. I would like to start by saying I am ecstatic that this mascara does not have a fragrance to it. I have had issues with last Huda products having a strong fragrance to them. 

I tested this mascara on four different people with difference types of lashes and of course sanitizing the wands in between.
I have long dense and eyelashes with a natural curl. For my lashes, they clumped together and made it look like I didn‚Äôt have as many eyelashes as I actually do. I will say that it did lengthen quite a lot and it was the blackest mascara I‚Äôve ever used. Unfortunately, I had to cut my wear test short because my eyes were sensitive to something in the formula.

My mom has shorter less dense lashes and this worked wonders on here it lengthened, volumized and curled, and lasted all day without smudging or changing at all. She had no complaints.

My sister also has long dense eyelashes but no natural curl. She experienced the same issues as me. They were clumped together, but they did lengthen quite a bit. She was not a fan of the fibers.

My sister in law tried it as well, and she had short medium density eyelashes. She loved it and is going to be purchasing it in the future. It added a lot of volume, length and curl and it looked stunning on her! 

They all said it wore well and stayed looking exactly the same by the end of the day. I was the only one that had to cut the wear test short. 

My final thoughts are that this is a great mascara for someone with shorter, light to medium density lashes who want a lot of volume, length, and curl to their lashes. I would not recommend this to anyone with already long or dense lashes. By dense I mean you have a lot of lashes.",21 May 2020,Influenster Free Mascara Review,MaleMua,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No

"I received this product for free for testing purposes. I have been looking for a mascara since I have run out of all of my go-to‚Äôs and this could not have come at a more perfect time. The mascara is amazing. It is like having 2 in 1. One big wand is used for volumizing and a small wand is used for lengthening. You can use them together too which gives a very beautiful look. If you love to wear falsies, forget about them! This mascara is much easier and faster to use. I also love using the small lengthening wand on my bottom lashes. I love this formula because it does not make my lashes dry or give them a ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù feeling which i have problems with many different mascaras.

Then I did one coat of the curl and length side and omg the two together literally made it look as if I have false lashes on. The best part is that I didn‚Äôt even curl my lashes with an eyelash curler!  Absolutely amazing!!!",20 May 2020,,Norali2,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"I received this to try in exchange for a review and I'm so happy I did.This mascara is wonderful! Its such a clever idea to have a duel ended tube with different formulas & brushes on either side. Both formulas are great and glide on easy without clumping. The volumizing side noticeably thickened my lashes without clumping them together and the lengthening side nicely separated them while adding a subtle curl. This mascara stays on all day without flaking off. The price point is such an amazing deal as you get 0.28 oz on each side (Better Than Sex is 0.27 oz for $25) for $27. If you're in the market for new mascara, I would definitely recommend giving this a try.",20 May 2020,Amazing!,Blou22,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"First of all, it‚Äôs basically 2 mascaras in 1, which is awesome. Personally, because of that I found the length to be a little awkward when applying, but I will get used to that. When using both sides together, my lashes have never looked so long and dark. A great dramatic mascara if you use both, but if you just want a natural look, just for curl and length side.",20 May 2020,,jklolz,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
One of the best mascaras ive tried in a very long time. You can build layers if you want. Made my lashes look fake!!,20 May 2020,Best mascara lately,jenlouise1985,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
"Things I do Like:
Smooth formula
Very very pigmented 
Has a good weight to it/feels luxury 

That being said, I didn't really get the false lash effect. It curled well, but the finished look was pretty natural on me. No matter how many layers I applied, I couldn't get any volume. I'm hoping that will change as the mascara dries out. I do like the natural look, so I'll keep using this. Mascara always reacts differently for everyone, so I do think it's worth a try even though it didn't work as desired with my personal chemistry.",20 May 2020,Luxe Smooth Formula,Madduw,Huda Mascara,Mascara,No
