"It‚Äôs overall a good product but, INSANELY difficult to blend. The pigment is spot on though. The packaging is okay but it leaks into the cap.",15 Jan 2025,Read before you buy,preppy777,Tilbury,Blush,No
"The tube only consists half of the product, rest is air that gets squeezed out. The applicator isn‚Äôt practical on its own and you would need a beauty blender or brush. It‚Äôs not as pigmented as I hoped, as it took many taps to see the color on my cheek. Otherwise the shade is really pretty and texture is creamy.",5 Jan 2025,Almost Just Air,Cantarella,Tilbury,Blush,No
"The MOST underhyped blush imo. Not only is it beautiful creamy, not too matte, but it STAYS. Don‚Äôt be intimidated by the ‚Äúmatte‚Äù description. Blends out beautifully too. Also, my wand lasted me a YEAR.",5 Jan 2025,Buy it. Try it. Love it.,danik8718,Tilbury,Blush,No
Love this color on me worked so well. Easy to blend out. The price tho‚Ä¶ I just wish it wasn‚Äôt so expensive. The wand it great. just make sure not to squeeze so hard or to much will come out.,4 Jan 2025,Great color! Not so bad.,Lunacuttie3,Tilbury,Blush,No
Love this blush!Easy to blend and beautiful packaging!But the colour on the packaging doesn‚Äôt match what it looks like on skin.,28 Dec 2024,,bkahhj,Tilbury,Blush,No
"bad bad bad. this product is such a waste of your money! first of all, it comes with less than half of the tube filled up and not only that, it exploded everywhere after a week I got it. blush feels oily and doesn‚Äôt look matte at all. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY",8 Dec 2024,HORRIBLE,queengirl198,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I like the pigment but can‚Äôt recommend you spend money on something that‚Äôs going to goop out all over the place. The way the packaging is, makes it very difficult to save your product. It leaks out inside the cap and outside because it has a twist too. It also looses a LOT of product if you decide to take it on the plane because of the pressure. There will be nothing you can do other than maybe save it in a different container but risk for contamination. Overall I‚Äôd love to see the formula in a different packaging because it‚Äôs pigmented and lasts but it also needs to be applied over maybe not liquid foundation because I found it took some of it off as I tried blending it in and it left patches on my amface.",29 Nov 2024,Like the formula but packaging wastes product!,,Tilbury,Blush,No
The perfect shade of pink. I can‚Äôt stop using this daily!,20 Nov 2024,Perfect color for light to medium skin,itssjazminn,Tilbury,Blush,No
"You can sheer out the pigment a lot and get a really natural look--this shade is actually really close to my natural flush. It's a bit unforgiving in terms of how soon after applying that you need to blend it out, though, otherwise it will look patchy, but the application is mostly great",12 Nov 2024,,viiiix,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I didn't care for the performance of this product.  It doesn't blend out very well on the skin, a bit streaky.   Also, the packaging seems cheap and the product leaks.  I would not repurchase.  There are many better products out there.",11 Nov 2024,,colormepharose,Tilbury,Blush,No

I used this product consecutively for a couple weeks because I was that obsessed with this cream blush. I even used it on my eyes as well. It‚Äôs a multi use product. I get compliments on it all the time!,17 Sep 2024,Yall! Buy this must have product,beaurevu,Tilbury,Blush,No
If I could give less than 1 star I would. THIS CRAP IS HORRIBLE. Packaging 0/10 hate the puff ball. Product 0/10 doesn't blend well and ends up patchy. Formula 0/10 NO BLENDABILITY and DRIED OUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,12 Sep 2024,DO NOT BUY,MarieWhite,Tilbury,Blush,No
While I love the color and formula of this product I absolutely hate the packaging. Messy and desperately in need of an update.,1 Sep 2024,,LexiBeautyRouge,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I have sworn by this product for i think over a year now? And i‚Äôve had the same one for 6 months, use it almost daily. The applicator is so soft and stays intact and you don‚Äôt need much product. A little goes a long way with this blush. Charlotte Tilbury does it every time.",21 Aug 2024,,alyssaross1,Tilbury,Blush,No
It was great in the first few months but then it dried up and it‚Äôs a mess! It‚Äôs a battle to get some product off the tube. Very disappointing: (,18 Aug 2024,Great until it dries up,AlexTx,Tilbury,Blush,No

It‚Äôs a nice blush but has its flaws. I have fair cool skin and can look orange on my skin. You also have to use a lot of product or it disappears on the skin. The packaging is also really messy. It is a noce color and feels nice on the skin.,5 Aug 2024,,LilacAlora,Tilbury,Blush,No
"Much alike to the  contour, this product is very patchy with little product for its price. Sure, it is pigmented, but there are other blushes that will perform better.",30 Jul 2024,Not worth the splurge.,Ally2026,Tilbury,Blush,No
Wanted to love this because the contour wand is amazing however the colour is way to pigmented and doesn‚Äôt go on as nicely as the contour wand product. Patchy. Just not a fan at all.,25 Jul 2024,,melania21,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I see many negative reviews on this product, but I absolutely love it. The color is sheer and beautiful and blends nicely. A little goes a long way, so don‚Äôt overuse. I carefully unlock the applicator sponge, then, then squeeze just enough to moisten the sponge, then lock it again. That amount will last me several days with no leaking asqueeze just enough to moisten the sponge and then lock the applicator and that amount of blush will last me several days without leaking.",16 Jul 2024,Beautiful Product!,kmcis,Tilbury,Blush,No
When I bought this blush I loved it. As the weeks passed it became more patchy on my cheeks and it separated at the skin. Definitely a skip for me which is a bummer given the fact of the price point and the beautiful color. In my opinion you can skip this blush.,14 Jul 2024,Sadly a skip for me,Isabelli12,Tilbury,Blush,No
"The color is great, the feel and blendability is great but the packaging is atrocious. The locking mechanism does not stay locked so you never know what you‚Äôre gonna get when you take the top off. I have ruined two blouses and a brand new make up case because the creamy blush got all over the place and it‚Äôs impossible to get out once you get it on your clothes - threw mine just the trash in fear of ruining another favorite top!",12 Jul 2024,,Oceans22,Tilbury,Blush,No

"First of all, the packaging on this product is beautiful! I love the applicator, and spills and leaks aren't common at all. The pigment is on point, and the blush stays on all day, which is convenient for me. Aside from the high price point, I have no complaints. There's so much product for the price, so it's very convenient. It blends seamlessly into my skin and looks absolutely stunning! Overall, the only way to describe this product is amazing! Charlotte Tilbury brings it's A game to the table, or in this case, the vanity.",8 Jul 2024,Must have blush!,Sophia101118,Tilbury,Blush,No
After using this for a while I actually liked the color and the formula wasn‚Äôt bad. The reason I gave 3 stars was for the packaging. After I would squeeze more product out it became so messy with the product all over the inside of the tube and outside of the tube. I would recommend but the packaging was just a let down.,6 Jul 2024,Just beware of the packaging !,laurasophiaa29,Tilbury,Blush,No

application is simple if you gently dab the product! colour is so beautiful on my light neutral olive skin (as per the review before stated). buildable and overall great if you‚Äôre willing to spend $$. I just wish the lid twisted shut instead of the simple pull off.,7 Jun 2024,pricey but great,wildefairy,Tilbury,Blush,No

"I treated myself with this one but for me it did not live up to the hype.

"Like o there‚Äôs have mentioned the packaging almost makes you want to hate it. The doing applicator twist to open thing is not doing it for me, just so messy. Pay off is cute, very blendable, nice sheen/texture. Definitely use a brush to blend this, do not use a beauty blender it just eats this product right up!

"I tried to love and make this blush on work, but unfortunately it didn't work for me. Too patchy and I had to remove it using makeup remover and change into another blush on! So disappointed and this is too expensive!",26 Apr 2024,No. Don't buy this,Alian15,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I‚Äôve been looking for a pink shade cream blush and I like Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks and setting powder so I decided to give this blush a try. It has a low pigment, it is buildable but it just didn‚Äôt look natural looking, so I returned it right away.",24 Apr 2024,Not so much pigment,zibaghasemi,Tilbury,Blush,No
I put two small dots on my cheek and blend it out with a brush.  On the occasion that I get too much on my cheek I just dab it with a wet beauty blender and that does the trick. I have every color Charlotte Tillbury blush and this is my new favorite with the pillow talk highlighter.,22 Apr 2024,A little goes a long way,FranDeSantiago,Tilbury,Blush,No
It‚Äôs really hard to blend it No worth it! It‚Äôs really messy,19 Apr 2024,waste of money,jennysgm03,Tilbury,Blush,No
Perfect everyday blush. The formula is matte but not drying. Blends out easily and has medium pigment level. Easier for this novice to work with vs the rare beauty which are VERY pigmented. I have all the colors!,18 Apr 2024,Best liquid blush for all levels,blushing4days,Tilbury,Blush,No
"Separates on skin, goes on patchy and doesn‚Äôt last. Not worth the money. I would expect way better for the price point.",16 Apr 2024,Just no,ksheah,Tilbury,Blush,No
I have used this product every day but one for the last week and I regretted the day I didn't use it. The formula is amazing - I was worried it would be too pigmented (looking at you Rare Beauty) but it blended out so easily and stayed put all day. The color is also perfect for my very fair muted olive tone skin. I didn't want to love this product because it's a bit pricey but I use only a few dots each day so I feel like the tube will last me quite a while. I can't wait to use this more!,12 Apr 2024,A new daily favorite,AshBol,Tilbury,Blush,No
I wanted to love it so bad but I just find it really hard to apply. It freezez immediately and it gets so hard to blend. Does anyone have that problem if not please advice me on how to use it because i may be wrong.,12 Apr 2024,,Fionacobo,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I've been using this for almost a year now, and I actually love it! At first I was blending it out with a beauty blender, so it seemed like there was no color payoff. however I've learnt that it's best to blend it out with a brush, and mostly on the outer edges. I do layer it with powder blush but it is an extremely long lasting combo. and a little goes a long way if you blend it out right and mostly at the edges. yes it is pricy, and it doesn't take long for it to seem like the tube is mostly finished, but that's deceiving. Pink pop is my favorite, but I also like Peach pop and the contour shade.",12 Apr 2024,,ZSahar,Tilbury,Blush,No
"The initial color is bright and beautiful but once you blend or brush it out, the color completely dissipates. You have to layer with a powder blush to even bring out any color. This isn‚Äôt the pop of pink I was expecting. Maybe perfect for a natural beat or very very light makeup, but not for a soft glam or full makeup look",31 Mar 2024,Not nearly as pigmented as advertised!,ChristisLord1,Tilbury,Blush,No
i love this blush!!! it is so pigmented and the perfect shade!,21 Mar 2024,,Anna1040,Tilbury,Blush,No
"Eh, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs worth the money. It has a shimmery finish which some people love but I don‚Äôt particularly like it and the color pay off isn‚Äôt anything near what I would have expected with that price tag. If you are looking for a good blush I personally love the Marit blushes in any color, my favorite is cheecky.",21 Mar 2024,Not worth the money,makennakopriva,Tilbury,Blush,No
"Pink pop is gorgeous. The wand more expensive than other liquid blushes because there‚Äôs more product in the tube - about 86% more than Rare Beauty‚Äôs standard size. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre getting almost twice as much product, because the packaging is so much lighter. My brain irrationally wants to believe that it‚Äôs overpriced, even though that‚Äôs apparently not the case. TBD if I‚Äôd buy again.",19 Mar 2024,"Good, but the packaging undermines the value",HeyItsAlexandra,Tilbury,Blush,No

This is a beautiful color while it last on your skin! The blush didn't seem to stay on for long! It blends beautifully and pigmented but you better be quick cause it dries so fast! I suggest you use a damp beauty blender! Got this from influencer and Charlotte Tilbury for my honest review!,6 Mar 2024,It's pretty,bobbi7202,Tilbury,Blush,No
"Going to be real honest here‚Ä¶.it dries entirely too fast. When you dabble it on, you better blend quickly. It‚Äôs best to use a damp beauty blender. I have an obsession with blushes & these are my least favorites.",5 Mar 2024,Not worth the money.,KeKeCrow19,Tilbury,Blush,No

"no. Just no. I'm sorry but what? I'm paying 42$ for something that has a huge percentage of the product gone? Now, don't get me wrong or even start with me but the formula could be better but it could work. Here, whats bothering me is the packaging. number one it absorb an ABSURD amount of product leaving you with less then half the original amount of product and ngl if it was elf that's not too much money I wouldn't be upset about it but 42$ for a blush that you don't even get half of the product and makes a HUGE mess leaving you with about 25% of the original product. I'm sorry but isn't worth it will never be but the formula could use work but it okay its just the fact I'm left with 25% of the product at the end that I've spent 42$ on I'll pass take it down or upgrade the packaging by removing the applicator and add in something that doesn't absorb like a pump or something like that.

"I love this blush formula, especially the pink and mauve (Pillow Talk) colors with my red hair and cool-tone fair skin. The formula is long-lasting and doesn‚Äôt budge in the humid summer. It‚Äôs also fragrance free. I can‚Äôt stand the sponge applicator and also found applying the product directly to my face was too much. Instead, I put a dot on my hand, evenly coat a dense brush and apply before powder. This allows me to blend out easier with foundation leftover on my sponge if it goes on too heavy. Also, since I don‚Äôt apply it directly to my face, I bought little jars and just emptied the tube into a small jar. So much cleaner and nicer than the sponge. The pink is my favorite. I tried the peach but found it a little much for my complexion. I also like mixing the matte mauve PT wand with the Pinkgasm wand for a little something extra. They mix beautifully together.",30 Dec 2023,"Pink, Mauve/Pillow Talk, and Peach",g1ngerg1l79,Tilbury,Blush,No

"For reference, I have oily, eczema prone skin with an olive undertone. I have a personal criteria for cream blushes to appease my eczema. 3 stars for the performance of the formula. This formula blends well with a brush and it is buildable. You have to blend quickly because this blush sets. It's a beautiful soft matte finish that doesn't feel dry!

Minus 2 stars in terms of limited color range and for the packaging. There is little accessibility for skin tones in the matte wands. I have to adjust the rest of my makeup in order to make the slightly bluey cherry undertone of Dream Pop work with my olive undertone. The formula alone works well and lasts a while, it just needs more shades so others can enjoy it.

Cleaning the sponge is a bit of a hassle. I have to lock the tip, wipe off the excess and then wash the entire sponge until the water runs clear. It feels like a waste of product, but this is the only way I can truly clean it. I have to frequently clean my makeup and tools to minimize eczema flare ups, so I don't usually reach for this for sanitary reasons.",8 Jun 2023,"Cute, but not for me",sumlem,Tilbury,Blush,No

"I got to try the NEW Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand -  Dream Pop! If you like liquid blushes, I think you‚Äôll really like this one. It is VERY concentrated so you only need a tiny (and I mean tiny) bit for your cheeks. I‚Äôm wearing Dream Pop which is a vibrant, deep, cool cherry. After you twist off the cap, make sure the arrow is pointed to the ON position then give it a little squeeze so it floats up to the sponge tip. I didn‚Äôt read the directions carefully and kept trying to squeeze it in the OFF position. This blends very easily without feeling or looking greasy or dewy. I like the convenience of the tube because it easily fits into your makeup bag and it‚Äôs secure. This is long wearing, cruelty free and free of Sulfates SLS and SLES.

"I received Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand Peach Pop #complimentary from @Influenster & @CharlotteTilbury for my honest review #CTBlushWandsxInfluenster 

The packaging was good looking yet simple and easy to identify what was inside. The wand itself was a perfect size for hand control and I like that the applicator tip is twist to open/close so that there is no spillage. The one caution I would say is use a light hand when ‚Äúdobbing‚Äù the sponge tip to your cheek or only put one dot as a little goes a long way. It was nice to be able to blend it in with the applicator tip instead of a separate sponge too. I found the coverage was good and I liked the color. I did like the color with my complexion and if you‚Äôre looking for a quick, easy pop of color to your cheeks I recommend giving this wand by Charlotte Tilbury a try.",14 Apr 2023,"Compact, easy to use & my new go to!",jobell2355,Tilbury,Blush,No

"This blush looked very densely pigmented when I first dotted it on and felt the thickness of the cream formula on skin. I think it is crucial to get to blending right away once you apply this. Their formula isn‚Äôt one where you can map out all your highlight contour blush conceal/colorful correct zones and then get to blending. You want to blend before you‚Äôre stuck with dots or streaks because the formula is already drying 
Was this blush easy to use? Sorta. I‚Äôm used to powder format for blush but also the other cream formulas I use like my wax based foundation are much more blendable and less of a drying cream. 

This blush is subtle on me, but does seem to stay long lasting as long as you set it with spray and/or powder.",13 Apr 2023,Use it often but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a favorite yet,jenninsocal,Tilbury,Blush,No

The charlotte tilbury matte blush wand has a very fluid texture and blends out quite easily to give a natural finish (not a flat matte). It‚Äôs a powerhouse when it comes to lasting power and last well upto 10 hours on me when I took it off. The colour I picked was Pink Pop. Right out of the tube it does look more peachy but as you can see on the skin  and once blended it‚Äôs a neutral bright pink colour.

I have three colors of the matte blush wands and love all of them. The only one I don‚Äôt have is pop so I can‚Äôt speak for that one. I think these are so covenant to use and great for a quick 10 minute everyday look. As well as for a full glam look when I layer it with a powder blush. I never have a problem with them looking patchy or disturbing the foundation underneath regardless of the foundation. They can be a light wash of color or built up. They are long lasting even if I don‚Äôt apply a powder blush on top. And as long as you lock the top I never have a problem with it leaking out product. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even push out more product and leave it locked while using product on the sponge from the day prior. Which helps the sponge not get too much buildup on it. I know people complain that there‚Äôs a lot of air in the tube but I use mine often and still don‚Äôt run through them quickly and feel they are worth the price because I love them so much.

I've really been in a liquid/cream blush kick and this would be my favourite out of my collection.

"If you are looking for a soft pale rose pink shade that looks like you just came off the metaphorical ski slopes and saw cute baby bunnies running through the snow on the way making you blush with sweetness, look no further than Pink Pop.
I am a light medium olive undertone with slight yellow over tones and I always love how this shade of pink cancels out the sallowness and makes me look refreshed. The formula blurs your skin and reminds me of the effect a foundation would have but in a blush form, but it doesn't feel heavy like a foundation at all.
Just remember to turn the end to on to squeeze out a little and then turn it to the ""OFF"" setting once you have enough product out.
I would even recommend keeping it off for the next few uses until you need more product on the tip, that's what has worked for me in using the other Charlotte Tilbury highlight and contour wands.",19 Mar 2023,Sweet petal pink blush,sweetpea377,Tilbury,Blush,No

"I received this item free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. 

Let me get this out there first, I know cream/liquid blushes are the trendy thing this past year, but I‚Äôm a powder blush person through and through. So take whatever I say with this in mind because I know this has gotten positive reviews from influencers and makeup artists that I‚Äôve seen.

For starters, I just don‚Äôt love this packaging. I know it‚Äôs the same as the contour and light wands that were a big hit, but it‚Äôs messy to me. It does have a twist lock so it doesn‚Äôt all come out through the sponge if it gets squeezed in your makeup bag. I just mean that it‚Äôs messy because I have to put it on my hand first to pick up with a stippling brush or pick it up off the tip with my finger and dab it on. When I wiped it on my hand and used a stippling brush to pick it up, it applied and blended flawlessly without disturbing my foundation. 
It felt somewhat heavy on my cheeks and like it may have smeared or transferred to everything if I hadn‚Äôt set it down with translucent powder. One perk of the tackiness I mentioned is that it seemed to really last with no fading even after a heavy sweat filled workout. 

This name of this product is Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush which is a bit misleading. I don‚Äôt feel like it is truly matte other than the fact that there is no shimmer or glitter in the formula. The tackiness ended up giving me a glossy glowy look even after applying translucent powder. With the word matte in the product name, i was expecting something with some type of silicone or dimethicone base. 

Take from this what you will because it is not a bad product, but just different than what I was expecting from the name. I just wanted to give an idea about the consistency for anyone considering purchasing this item so they would know what they were getting. I can definitely see someone with drier skin or even someone who loves cream products enjoying this.",12 Mar 2023,Sort of tacky/heavy feeling,lucy062,Tilbury,Blush,No

"I really wanted to love this blush and to be honest it‚Äôs great, sadly it‚Äôs less pros than cons. The color is so pretty on my light skin and just works for me, but also it lasts incredibly well which I wasn‚Äôt expecting. Seriously all day long! And it blends so buttery. The things that make me probably not repurchase is the packaging, the lid didn‚Äôt stay on very well so the product hardened on the tip of the applicator so it couldn‚Äôt squeeze out anymore product. It did have a open/close feature but that didn‚Äôt help so sadly after a couple uses I can‚Äôt anymore. Then on top of that there is not a good amount of product.",11 Mar 2023,Pretty but disappointing,balienlabs,Tilbury,Blush,No

"I recently had the opportunity to try the Charlotte Tilbury Matte Beauty Blush Wand, which I received complimentary in exchange for an honest review. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the results. As someone who has had mixed experiences with liquid blushes in the past, I was initially skeptical of this product. However, after trying it out, I can confidently say that it is a game-changer.

One of the standout features of this blush is its blendability. It glides on smoothly and is easy to blend in, without leaving any harsh lines or uneven patches. Additionally, it feels incredibly lightweight on the skin, which is a major plus for those who prefer a more natural look.

The shade of the blush that I tried was also stunning. It was the perfect balance of pigmented and subtle, giving me a healthy, natural-looking flush. I also appreciate that it comes in a wand format, which makes it incredibly easy to apply and control the amount of product used.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Charlotte Tilbury Matte Beauty Blush Wand to anyone looking for a high-quality liquid blush.

"The new Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand in Peach Pop is easy to apply and feels lightweight on my skin and dries quickly without transferring to other things like clothes. For the photos I only did one application and it was enough to give a slight flushed look to add color to my face. The Peach Pop shade looked more reddish on my skin tone and it is buildable if you want the color to really be obvious on your skin in two or three applications. My skin did not feel irritated by the product and there was no fragrance that I could detect from the liquid blush. I would be open to trying their other shades since I did not have an itchiness or irritation occur when using this product. It has a pull off cap and then you twist it to the right for the ‚Äúon‚Äù position and squeeze gently to get the liquid blush out. The cushiony tip feels gentle on the skin as you are applying it. When you are done applying the blush, remember to turn it to the ‚Äúoff‚Äù position to avoid having extra product come out when its in a makeup bag or any other method of storage.",8 Mar 2023,Feels lightweight and doesn‚Äôt transfer,intriceblog,Tilbury,Blush,No
"Charlotte Tilbury‚Äôs Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand is supposed to have a ‚Äúsoft silky warmth for a youthful, beautiful glow.‚Äù It looked slightly more satin than matte. The fluffy applicator felt soft, but it had a tendency to apply to much blush. It would also be hard to clean the applicator, so eventually your foundation and sunscreen will get on the applicator. I didn‚Äôt have any issue with the reddish, slightly pinky coral color of Dream Pop, but it could easily be built up into a very pigmented color. Perfect for those with a complexion darker than a cappuccino!

I found the consistency to be very sticky and tacky, so the blush itself would sometimes pull up while I was trying to blend it. (See my hand for an example.) I had to pick small pills of blush off my face today when applying the blush just over sunscreen. I had better luck applying with my ring finger (as opposed to a foundation sponge or cream blush brush) and slowly building the color up to my preferred vibrancy on top of foundation and powder. It never built up enough coverage to cover freckles, but did get to a nice flushed blush look quickly. I only had one instance where I thought the blush faded prematurely.

Given the texture and tendency to smear, drag, and sit on top of my cheeks, I would not recommend this blush to makeup newbies. If you wanted to try a liquid blush with a locking cap for travel and soft applicator, but didn‚Äôt want an in your face color, Dream Pop may not be the color for you- try the other shades of this product.

"I really like this blush as far as the color, blendabolity, finish, and value for the money. A little goes a really long way. All you need is one little dot for each cheek for a beautiful, natural finish. That said, it‚Äôs easy to get from 0 to clown in seconds. I recommend putting it on the back of your hand before blending onto your cheeks, so you can better control the amount you apply. The finish is matte, even for oily skin. However, I dont think drier skinned people would have issues with it being too dry.  I don‚Äôt think the sponge applicator is ideal, as over time it would be unsanitary. I suppose it could be washed, but this should really be a squeeze tube opening. Turning it does lock it in the off position, but the product that is already on the sponge tip stays there. Plus, the applicator isn‚Äôt practical for blending. I thought I would also try this I‚Äôm on my lips, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the right consistency for that. I appreciate Influenster providing this for my honest review.",8 Mar 2023,Beautiful but use a light hand.,Mamagirl7,Tilbury,Blush,No
"This Charlotte Tilbury matte blush wand was unlike any blush I‚Äôve tried before. It was extremely pigmented; a very little goes a long way. I needed only a tiny dot. I probably needed a different shade, a lighter pink would do better for my complexion and make up style. I found it easy to apply (just a tiny dab) and I liked the applicator quite a bit. The top was tricky to get off the first time, but I figured it out. This blush wand really gives my winter skin a nice healthy glow. I recommend, but make sure you get the right shade. Start small; you can always add more. You don‚Äôt want to have to redo your entire face because you put on too much!",8 Mar 2023,Super pigmented!,theresarg,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I am loving this blush! I have the pink pop and will definitely be trying the other colors. I really love the ease of being able to add as much or as little to my cheeks as I want - having that control is great. The pink is matte but also very fresh but being pigmented enough to add impact.

The only con is not knowing how much is in the tube.",8 Mar 2023,Pink pop really POPS!,RebeccaJune,Tilbury,Blush,No
"The CT Matte Beauty Blush Wand is the easiest way to apply blush on the go! You just dial up the dots for an effortless glow of color. I use typically two dots and blend them out using my blush 
brush or fingers. The color is super pigmented and lasting. As in it lasts all day! The applicator is super soft and I love the packaging. #complimentary #CTBlushWandsxInfluenster @Influenster @CharlotteTilbury",8 Mar 2023,,MagnoliaBlooms,Tilbury,Blush,No
Great liquid blush. It is highly pigmented so a little goes a long way. Make sure to twist to close.,8 Mar 2023,Great blush,dmcdona2,Tilbury,Blush,No
Gorgeous color! You have to work very quickly with this product though. One cheek at a time and slowly build to your desired color. It is truly a matte finish and it‚Äôs buildable so you can do a wash of color or a bold cheek. It does not lift foundation or other cheek products underneath. The piece you can use to close it is so clever and helps keep from wasting product.,8 Mar 2023,Beautiful color and finish!,sneakysnam,Tilbury,Blush,No
This new Pillow Talk blush wand has to be one of the best beauty products I‚Äôve tried recently! I‚Äôm loving how easy this cream blush applies and how buildable it is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hoping it lasts a while but I‚Äôm not positive at .4 oz - would need to compare to other liquid blushes. I also love that it‚Äôs not easy to accidentally apply too much on the first go around because of how blendable it is and the pigment seems to melt into the skin while not overpowering with too much color right off the bat. I‚Äôm not trying to look like a clown here. I really want to get another because I‚Äôve been into to using multiple shades of blush at the same time to create a custom look with more dimension. 10/10 would recommend.,8 Mar 2023,Loving this buildable dream blush!,CarrieWM,Tilbury,Blush,No
I love Charlotte Tilbury products in general so I was thrilled to sample this product in Peach Pop via Influenster.  The Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand in Peach Pop is very easy to use... for me one dot on each check is just the right amount of color.

"Charlotte Tilbury‚Äôs Beauty Blush Wand in Peach Pop- Described as a NUDE peach color but once I pressed the tube, a vibrant peach & very summery shade appeared on the white cushion applicator‚Ä¶ 
¬†
Tbh, I don‚Äôt usually wear a ton of ‚Äúcolor‚Äù and always reach for more muted and neutral colors. I thought this blush wand would end up in a pile to collect dust, but surprisingly I‚Äôve been reaching for it ever since I received it.

One dot at a time! The blush is highly pigmented, blendable, and buildable. Dot, but don‚Äôt drag, the cushiony applicator across the skin. One dot is all you need on each side to add a bit of color to your cheeks. Once blended into the skin, Peach Pop looks very natural and ‚Äúnude peach‚Äù would be an accurate description of the color.
¬†
The packaging is gorgeous. The sleek, peach colored tube combined with the golden cap, makes the blush wand look high end. The only thing that would have made it better is a screw on cap. The cap is a little bit hard to press onto the tube and if it isn‚Äôt complete secured to the tube, it easily falls off and you‚Äôll end up with dried up blush on the applicator.",8 Mar 2023,,SMolina1175,Tilbury,Blush,No

I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I was a little hesitant about the color but I actually ended up loving it! It served two purposes for me as a cheek and lip tint! I think I may have actually loved it on my lips the most! I questioned the applicator at first because it didn‚Äôt apply the way I would have wanted and I ended up rubbing it in with my fingers.

"A really lovely product! I received the shade Dream Pop, which is a fun cherry red with a gorgeous pop of color. The product is super pigmented, so a little goes a long way, and I love that it will last a long time! The matte finish is very pretty, but I‚Äôve found you have to work quickly to blend it after applying a dot or two. So I suggest applying one cheek at a time and working to blend one side before applying to the other. My cheek had a few little bumps after the first few times I wore this product, but I have sensitive skin and they eventually went away after a week. I would definitely recommend this product!",7 Mar 2023,,rachsebas1,Tilbury,Blush,No

"It‚Äôs ok. I think I just don‚Äôt rock with liquid blush. I find cream blush easier to work with. 

With that in mind, here‚Äôs what I liked and disliked about this particular product: 

Likes:
- The packaging is great. I love the ability to switch it to the ‚Äúoff‚Äù position so that if you keep it in a bag and it gets squished, it won‚Äôt end up causing spills
- That it‚Äôs buildable from sheer to opaque even if I had some trouble trying to find the right amount of color pay off

Dislikes:
- The peach was just too orange for me
- i found it hard to blend without blending it away ‚Äî and then applying more would end up being too much blush. It was hard to get the right amount for the color pay off I wanted.",7 Mar 2023,"It‚Äôs alright, I guess",egl17,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I was very excited to try this matte blush because I had heard so much about beauty light wand, but those were too shimmery for me. The first time I tried it I looked like a clown because I used way too much. A little goes a long way! Small dab and then blended with a beauty blender. It blended easily and dried down nicely! The packaging takes getting used to because of the way the blush comes out of the sponge applicator. The second time I used it, I opened the cap and there was blush all over the inside. Try not to squeeze the tube unless you are using it. Overall, I really liked it, and ai would purchase again.",7 Mar 2023,A little goes a long way,ChloeMe,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I haven‚Äôt used this brand too much in the past but thought this product was really great quality. I loved the packaging as well as the cute pink/gold combo on the blush wand itself. I was able to use this a few times but I personally have really oily skin and use a lot of setting powders to control oil which I didn‚Äôt find this to work super well with. I‚Äôm definitely holding onto this for warmer weather and hopefully some more dewy, less powder-forward looks but if that‚Äôs you‚Äôre regular makeup look then definitely give this one a try!",7 Mar 2023,,KelMag,Tilbury,Blush,No

"I had high hopes for this as it was my first CT product, sadly I was pretty underwhelmed. The formula is decent, long-lasting with good color payoff but the applicator is useless. I ended up applying with the wand and blending with my fingers. I also really dislike applicators that can't be cleaned. One can only imagine the bacteria that accumulates on this over time.

"I recieved the Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Matte Blush Wand in Pink Pop from Influenster and CT for my honest review. I was EXTREMELY excited to get this, but I would not let me getting it for free sway my review, so I made sure to try it several different ways to make sure I loved it just as much as my other favorite liquid and cream blushes regardless of price. 
I have really dry skin and I live in Las Vegas, so I was fearful that a matte blush was not going to do well on my skin, but I worried for nothing! Regardless of how I applied this, whether it was on my bare dry skin (as shown in the picture), over a Tinted Moisturizer/BB Cream, or on a foundation with more coverage this applied easily and wore well. I like that it just seemed to look like a natural flush and had a skin like finish, it didn't dry down too matte or powdery, and it felt like nothing on the skin. It also lasted well without getting patchy as it wore. I found the best way to apply it was dotting it directly on one cheek at a time, and then lightly blending it out with a beauty blender. It is easy to work with, didn't dry down too quickly but did dry down completely once I got it to where I liked it, and it didn't lift my base with this method. One layer left it looking very natural like in the picture shown, or I could easily apply multiple layers to build it up. 
I gave it 4 stars because of the price and color. While I do love this product, I think you could dupe it with something cheaper, but you are paying for the ease of use because I find this easier to apply than a lot of the similar blushes at least with the way I applied it. I also liked that the packaging, but I do think that the sponge top may get really dirty especially for those that wear a more full coverage foundation. Also, I got the shade Pink Pop which was a bit more peachy than I expected. It's still a pink shade and I like it, but I could imagine people expecting a true pink shade being disappointed.",7 Mar 2023,Great! Even for Super Dry Skin!,JeanJean84,Tilbury,Blush,No
"Thank you Influenster & Charlotte Tilbury for your gift of Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand in exchange for my honest review! It is truly PINK POP PERFECTION in a tube!!! This is seriously gorgeous! The color is a perfect peachy-pink shade that gives you a pop of natural color. It's highly pigmented, blends effortlessly, plus a tiny bit goes a long way! I like applying it to my fingers first then blending it out with a blush brush (focusing on the apples of the cheek then back towards the hairline). My mom was equally obsessed so I'm going to have to buy a replacement tube now! It's kind of pricy at $42 but I imagine this will last me for forever! It also seems to be very resistant to water & long-wearing... the swatch I made on the back of my hand lasted all day through several hand-washings so I love its longevity!

This is a very nice liquid blush product that applies and blends out beautifully. It is easy to layer to get a bit more pigment. Don‚Äôt be alarmed by the initial shade since it does blend out and isn‚Äôt as pigmented as it seems.

"Mixed feelings on this one. I'm not a big fan of sponge type applicators because they either drag my base around (if I'm wearing one) or get kind of dirty after awhile. This one dispensed a good amount of product though, and I was able to tap it on rather than dragging it across my face. However... I had a really hard time blending the color out, both over a foundation and on bare skin. I see a lot of reviewers DIDN'T have this problem so maybe it's an issue with my body chemistry. But after trying my fingers and 3 different brushes, I just couldn't get it to be anything but patchy on me. Oh well!

"Overall I really nice liquid blush! It blends well and can be as subtle or as bold as you want depending on how much you add.

First I tried it over my makeup which included powder already just because I was so excited when I got it but I already had a full face of makeup on, I tried blending it with my fingers, a beauty blender, and a brush and nothing prevented it from looking super spotty.

I hadn't tried a CT wand before so I was a little apprehensive that it would be messy or difficult and it does have a learning curve but it's not as bad as I was expecting. Make sure you turn the dial when you're not dispensing and blend quickly. With that being said, this shade on my skin tone seemed to blend away to nothing so I needed to build it up with a few applications and this formula does build easily without getting streaky.

I was really surprised at how much I liked this blush. I had never used a liquid or cream blush before and was a bit intimidated. However I gave it a shot and am so happy I did! It blends beautifully for a natural flush. And it's easily buildable if I wanted a more bold look. I will continue to use this and can't wait to try other colors!,4 Mar 2023,Beautiful and easily blendable blush,DKW929,Tilbury,Blush,No

"Thank you Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury for gifting me this Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand-Pink Pop in exchange for my honest review.

This is my first time using Charlotte Tilbury's cosmetic product. I have known that they are a great brand with great cosmetic products and that's why I was so excited when I was chosen. I received the pink pop shade and I really like this liquid blush matte. The texture looks creamy but actually it's lightweighted. It is very easy to use and with the built-in applicator,  you can control how much you want to use. Just 1 dot for a natural flush and 2-3 dots for an intensified blushing look. I use a brush to help spread the color and it blends easily and evenly on my skin, it gives a flawless color and lasts throughout the day. It's a very good price for the quality of the product you get. Highly recommend!!",4 Mar 2023,A must have one!!,adamsdewi,Tilbury,Blush,No
Really pigmented! Blends out really nicely with a sponge or brush. When used under powder blush lasts all day. Better than powder alone.,4 Mar 2023,Very pretty,CathyRN84,Tilbury,Blush,No
I really enjoyed this product. It was my first time using a cream blush (used mostly powder before) and I think I had a bit of a learning curve with how much to put on. I blended with my sponge and got a good color payoff. The formula is smooth and didn't feel heavy on the skin. I'd be open to trying other colors.,3 Mar 2023,Good color payoff,ycornejo,Tilbury,Blush,No

I was given this product complimentary from influencer to try out and exchange for a review. I love the Charlotte Tilbury brand and the only reason I gave this three stars is because I'm not a fan of the liquid blush I guess I prefer a powder blush because I'm used to it.

I received this product for free in exchange for my review. All my thoughts are my own and my honest feelings about the product. I really enjoy Charlotte Tilbury products and was very excited to receive this blush. I'm over 40 with dry skin and have really been into cream/liquid products especially during the winter so this blush came at the perfect time! It's a very pretty peachy pink that complimented my fair cool/neutral skin well. It's matte and very pigmented. You only need a small dot. I found the best way to apply was putting a dot on the back of my hand and using a medium density fluffy blush brush. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is the spongy tip (like the Maybelline age rewind concealer tip). They aren't my favorite as I feel they get very messy and if you try to wash them it seems you lose a lot of product. Otherwise another great product from Charlotte!,3 Mar 2023,Beautiful,sjianniney,Tilbury,Blush,No

"It had an easy-to-use applicator that had an on/off turn twist dispenser which I could control the amount squeezed for the look I wanted to achieve. I just dotted the amount I wanted and blended it with a blush brush. I thought with it being matte that it wouldn't work for my dry/mature skin, but this highly pigmented blush gave me a naturally flushed look. I'm not very advanced when it comes to makeup, and this was my first liquid blush. I am so happy with my results. I can see why it's sold every 6 seconds globally.

"Blush is not my strong point.  I like it, but it‚Äôs not the make up I ask most comfortable with.  And I never know what color/shade to get, so I usually have to ask someone.  When I received the Charlotte Tilbury blush wand in Peach Pop and saw the color, I was apprehensive.  The color looked so bright and awesome, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how it would look on me.  So, of course, I tried it and was very surprised.  I love it and it is definitely not something I would‚Äôve picked out in the store.  But, now I wear it several times a week especially since my skin seems so dull from winter and moving back up north.  It‚Äôs a nice pop of color!",2 Mar 2023,Won Me Over!,Tasia570,Tilbury,Blush,No
This is the blush I will be wearing when the sun is out. It is a beautiful peachy nude shade that is buildable and easily blends into the skin. I love the creamy formula and the packaging.

"Surprisingly, my very first Charlotte Tilbury product, and I have to say I was nervous to try this out. Blush but make it liquid!

I received the shade Dream Pop from Charlotte Tilbury & Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. I was so intrigued when I saw I was going to receive this -- I've always been so weary of cream blushes. I'm someone with pale skin so I thought a cream would be overwhelming. So to discover that this blush went on beautifully - better than all my powder blushes combined lol!!! And it blended so easily and nicely!! I was so happy and impressed to find out I was wrong about cream blushes. I have been wearing it every day - even though I work from home. It gives me a lil confidence boost because it looks and feels that nice!! I plan to buy the other shades they have as well because I just love the one I received so much!,2 Mar 2023,"Applies beautifully, immediate confidence boost!",katiemb007,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I really love this blush! It's so soft and creamy. The color is very vibrant with some peachy/coral in it too. It‚Äôs a really pretty color but I think but it is a little dark on my skin tone. I have to use it very lightly. I absolutely LOVE the sponge applicator and it blended out easily using my makeup brush. I would definitely try this again, just in a lighter tone. The only con is the sticker price, for the quality of the product, I expected to be a little more over the clouds with that cost.",2 Mar 2023,Blushing beauty,tblushingbeauty,Tilbury,Blush,No

"I received this product free from Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This is my new favorite blush! It looks alarmingly bright when first applied but once blended has a very natural, matte finish that is buildable if you want a more noticeable look. It does dry pretty quickly, so don‚Äôt wait to blend. I love the design of blush wand as well, you can turn the top to close it so no worries if leaks if you throw it in your bag.

I have a preference for cream face products, and I'm impressed by both the packaging and the formulation. I love that the wand allows you to squeeze just the amount of product you need out onto the applicator, and then close it - it really helps reduce the amount of wasted product.

"Charlotte Tilbury‚Äôs products have always worked for me, and the Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand is no exception.

This blush is very pigmented. So much so that if you‚Äôre a pale gal like me you should probably pass on this blush. A little bit goes a long way so I could easily see this product lasting forever. It dries quickly & lasts all day so blend quickly to avoid the clown look. It layers easily over liquid foundation. I docked a star because it applies super patchy which can make it easy to overdo wether blending with brush or fingers. Beautiful packaging but I didn‚Äôt love the applicator because it‚Äôs really hard to tell how much is on it. The peach pop color is beautiful but is too rich for my pale skin.,2 Mar 2023,Decent Liquid Blush,iheartsephora95,Tilbury,Blush,No
I received this product from Charlotte Tilbury and Influenster for free in exchange for my honest review. I absolutely ADORE this blush as it‚Äôs a gorgeous deep color that applies and blends in very well. I‚Äôve even used it as a lip tint with good results because I love the pigment of the dream pop wand.

"I really liked this cream blush from Charlotte Tilbury. It comes in a wand  with a pillow-like applicator, which is similar to a make-up blending sponge. The shade I received (Dream Pop) is a saturated red which could be worn sheer and well blended, but was also buildable for more saturated color. The swatches shown are straight from the applicator and the right one is after very light blending. With this saturated color I liked to use a brush to blend the color, but I imagine with a lighter shade the blending could be accomplished using the applicator alone.  I would recommend this product!",28 Feb 2023,"Buildable cream blush, innovative application",lifebynicole,Tilbury,Blush,No

I like Charlotte Tilbury products and this blush was no different. Is very pigmented and the color is buildable. I think it will last you a long time for the same reason.

I love the texture and the way this blush lasted all day for me. It doesn‚Äôt take much product to get a full face of blush (a little goes a long way) so it‚Äôs definitely worth the price.

"I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review. 

The Charlotte Tilbury wand is a liquid matte formula blush in a sponge applicator tube. It is available in four shades: Pink Pop, Peach Pop, Pillow Talk, and Dream Pop. I received the Dream Pop blush wand for my independent review. 

The wands are user-friendly. You dab the sponge applicator directly onto your skin and blend out the product with either your fingers, beauty sponge, or makeup brush. The formula is creamy, and thick and blends easily and seamlessly.¬† I found the pigments to be rich so it didn't take much of the product to create an airbrushed skin finish. 

Using the product was a little awkward at first because it said to twist it to open it but failed to mention the ""on/off"" twist on the wand. After removing the cap, make sure the wand is switched from ""off"" to ""on."" From there, squeeze the tube until a small amount of product can be seen on the cushion applicator. Next, dab the blush onto the apple of your cheeks to add a bit of color. (One dab is enough for a lighter skin tone to get the desired pigmented finish.) The final step is to blend everything upward and outward for a lifted look. When you're finished, make sure to switch the wand ""off"" to avoid any spillage or leaking in your makeup bag or vanity. 

PROS: The natural glow and lightweight formula won me over. The color can be blended to perfect dewy flush without looking too overdone. The formula states to be long-lasting and I found this to be so. I never found myself needing to reapply throughout the day. I've honestly never come across another product that melts onto my skin in such a buttery-soft way. 

CONS: The cap was a little hard to get back on the tube. I could foresee myself forgetting to switch the applicator to ""off"" before attempting to cap the product, and accidentally getting a bunch of blush everywhere.",25 Feb 2023,Deep Matte Color that POPS!,H3Ranch,Tilbury,Blush,No
This is a super pigmented blush. A little goes a long way. I dab once on my cheeks and blend with my fingers. I love the color and think it‚Äôs going to last a long time. My only con is that if you use more than a dab it is waaaay too much.,25 Feb 2023,,Brittany22207,Tilbury,Blush,No

"I can‚Äôt say I love or hate this product, I fall somewhere in the middle.  The outer packaging was very nice with a luxe look. The wand is a bit tricky, I did like the fact that underneath the lid you have to twist it to open or close. I had a bit of hard time determining exactly how much product was needed due to the fact that you squeeze the bottom and you cannot see how much product came out.  The blush itself was a nice consistency and blended in easily but I found the color, Pink Pop, to be peach/coral for me.   For the right skin tone, it‚Äôs a beautiful color and the pigment of the color is great! I found the blush to be long wearing as it stayed put for over 10 hours.   As long as you are cautious with the wand and sponge applicator I‚Äôd recommend giving this product a try.",24 Feb 2023,,EAP12,Tilbury,Blush,No

"Wow... this blush really surpassed all my expectations. Everything about it is A+.

"I received this in exchange for my honest review from Influenster. I'm giving 3 stars because for the price, the payoff isn't great.

I lovecthe highlighter wands she has and maybe the other shades in these have more pigment,  but this one ain't it for me.

"This cream blush is lovely as it is very hydrating and leaves a beautiful natural finish on the skin. Unlike most charlotte tilbury products it leaves a matte finish which is great for people prone to oily skin.

I love the formula of these, they‚Äôre a luminous matte finish that blend out beautifully - very creamy. No patchiness, just even colour and pigmentation.  The color I received, Dream Pop, was a little too red/intense for my very fair skin. It would probably work better for someone with a slightly darker skin tone.

I am legit impressed though because this product does what it's supposed to (which it SHOULD for $42!) I'm not prone to hyperbole in reviews.

"As part of an incentivized campaign I received a #complimentary  #CTBlushWandsxInfluenster from  @Influenster and @CharlotteTilbury. I was sent the color Peach Pop. Inspired by Charlotte's best-selling beauty lights wand, this long wearing formula actually surprised me quite a bit! Other products I've tried like this have left me rolling my eyes and throwing it promptly away. Not this one! Not only is the color beautiful, not only does it have a very nice wand that can be turned on and off, eliminating the typical mess or drying out of  product (see the photos) but it blends out so easily! It does dry down super fast so I'd suggest doing one side at a time. I put 2 small dots on each side. Not allowing product to fill the whole tip. Then I used my fingers tips to lightly tap to blend. Then I added a little bit (emphasis on little) to the tip of a beauty sponge and blended some more on towards my nose to make a ""W"". I then took one of my @rephr.to brushes to lightly continue the blend so it blended out the color as you see in the pictures. It may sound like a lot of work, but it isn't once you do it. I just broke it down into words to make it more understandable. And it is buildable. You can have a flush of color or continue to add and lighting blend (just don't overblend or you will blend it away) until you get it to the color you desire. This one is definitely a 4 out of 5 for me. And only a  4 because of the fact it dries down so quickly.

"I received this Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand in peach pop as a complimentary sample. From first look, I was a bit confused as to how I would feel about this. It is a squeeze tube with a white, pillowy, soft brush applicator. You squeeze the blush product out and it comes out from behind the brush applicator. The color is very vibrant at first glance, similar to a coral hue. The blush consistency is oily and thin. I decided to dab the brush onto the backside of my hand and then apply it either with my finger or beauty blender (both worked out well to be honest although I usually don‚Äôt make a habit of applying any makeup with my fingers). The blush surprisingly had a matte finish although it definitely did not look like this at first, being that it was oily and shiny on my hand. Ultimately, I was concerned this would not work for me as I have oily skin and oily products usually just wear off quickly. However to the contrary, this was exactly the opposite. Not only did it not look oily or feel oily once applied onto my face, it felt hydrating and lasted very long. It didn‚Äôt even budge throughout the day! I actually am very impressed by how light this felt and how it was matte but not drying. It blended so well with my make up and looked very natural. The shade worked well with my medium skin tone. It was definitely more subtle than it first looked, and just gave the right hint of color. I am very pleased with this overall and do recommend this blush.",19 Feb 2023,Long lasting,msosa61890j,Tilbury,Blush,No

I genuinely wanted to love this, as I do all my Charlotte Tilbury products but I don‚Äôt.

"This is a good cream blush product with a lot of payoff and color. It lasts on the skin and is easy to blend out. It comes on a dab applicator that is plush and easy to use. 

I am giving it a 4 out of 5 because of the color. The dream pop is a cherry red that will work on medium to darker skin tones as a good flush of color. On someone who is extremely fair like me, it is a little overpowering.

I have never used any Charlotte, Tilbury products, and as far as blush goes It‚Äôs usually hard for me to find one that matches my skin tone without looking washed out. It‚Äôs highly pigmented and offers a nice rosy flush. Start with a little and blend out. You can continue to build on it for a more vibrant color.  It feels lightweight on the skin.

I‚Äôm really enjoying th formula and I love the color. It stays on a long time and the shimmer is lovely. I‚Äôm just struggling with the applicator end ending up with too much product.

I do love the shade and it blends out well (when I don‚Äôt have too much that is!) I have really sensitive skin and have no complaints there! It‚Äôs possible the brush issue is user error.

I can not get enough of this product. At first I thought it was a liquid but later found out that it turns into a powder like blush once you put it on. This product is so easy to use.

"This blush is amazing! Super natural look and so easy to apply no matter what your skill level is. Just twist the applicator tip to the on (open) position, just it a gentle squeeze, dab on and blend. If you apply to much, like I did the first time, just keep blending. It blends like a dream! I also love that it is buildable. So if you didn't put enough on, add a bit more and continue to blend. It has a gorgeous matte finish and lasts all day. Definitely recommend.

"This blush is nice, but it does dry down rather quickly so you have to work fast to blend it out. I‚Äôve found blending with my fingers works best for me, rather than using a sponge or brush like I usually would.  A little goes a long way, but you can build it up if you want even more intensity. It definitely lasts all day, so don‚Äôt over-apply thinking it‚Äôll fade, because it won‚Äôt.

If you want less intensity, apply to your hand then prime your brush with it and use circular motions to apply onto the cheeks. I love it on the lips too!  I want to try the Peach pop and hopefully Sephora gets the Pillow Talk Pop!",14 Feb 2023,POP of color that lasts,Sonia311,Tilbury,Blush,No

I love the wand concept! If you‚Äôve tried the bronzer or highlighter wand from Charlotte Tilbury it is the same. I also like that it clicks open and close to help not waste any extra product. The color pay off is amazing! I was a little scared at first because I‚Äôm very fair skinned and the color I received is a cherry color that looked way too dark for me but with just a dab or two it blended out perfectly and looks so nice on the skin. I‚Äôm excited to try the other shades! So glad I was chose for this vox box!! I definitely recommend! #complimentary #CTBlushWandsxInfluenster @Influenster @CharlotteTilbury,14 Feb 2023,Sweet Cheeks,honeychai,Tilbury,Blush,No

"I absolutely love this product. I don't typically wear blush, but since trying this one I've been wearing it every day! I love the color and also like that it's not over the top.

"(Incentivized) I am enjoying the CT Peach Pop blush wand in my makeup routine. I was a bit worried that it might look flat due to it being matte, but it really doesn‚Äôt!

I‚Äôm so happy that I got to try this blush. I love to use both liquid and powder blush. The pink color gives a natural flush and it‚Äôs one of the easiest liquid blushes to blend that I‚Äôve come across. This is my new favorite.,14 Feb 2023,i‚Äôm in love,jammymcj,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I was super excited to get this from Influenster because A) I love blush and B) I haven't tried anything by Charlotte Tilbury yet! First off the matte packaging is stunning, and I love how the applicator twists open/closed to avoid excess product coming out. the puff is super soft and applies just enough product; the formula itself has a moussey, gel-like consistency that dries down fully but not quickly enough to where you can't blend it out. also the shade I got, Dream Pop, is STUNNING and is totally the shade I would've chosen myself! super pleased with this product!",14 Feb 2023,stunning packaging and product,Katewalsh4383,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I have never bought a liquid blush that I liked. I have tried several well known brands and just never felt like it settled on my face. I also found that a plane could smudge my foundation. This product is literally a game changer. The blush is liquid, but still 
Powdery enough to be blended in  by blush brush.
Like a lot of make up from this brand, these colors work on almost any skin tone. If you‚Äôre familiar with the highlighter that comes in the same container, you are absolutely love the blush. I will definitely be checking out the other shades.",14 Feb 2023,Never liked liquid blush until ‚Ä¶,aeddy12,Tilbury,Blush,No

I received this complimentary and it definitely isn‚Äôt my favorite product. The price point is quite high for such a small amount of product. I believe the color is ‚Äúbuildable‚Äù but it is rather sheer. The color is nice and it blends out alright as long as you don‚Äôt let it sit too long.

I found that this matte version was actually much easier to blend in then the original ones; this new formula is much more pliable whereas sometimes if I don‚Äôt apply the original in the right spot it can be a bit trickier to blend out. I would recommend these to CT current fans as well as those who have maybe wanted to try a beauty wand but have been hesitant too.

I recently picked this blush up in 2 shades - pink pop and peach pop. I‚Äôve really enjoyed wearing pink pop. It gives such a beautiful light flush to the skin and is buildable to your liking.

"Overall I like this product. I got the color Pink Pop and it reminds me of glossier cloud paint in puff. The color is pretty, it blends easily, and it lasts all day. My only complaint is the tube is misleading. You‚Äôd think you get a lot more product based on the size of the tube but it‚Äôs maybe half full.

"Okay, here‚Äôs me wearing the blush on two different days. As marketed, this blush definitely gives off the ‚Äúglow from within‚Äù vibe, instead of piling it on top (if that makes sense).

"Also received free product to write a review. The formula is ok as a liquid/cream blush. Nothing too revolutionary compared to everything else in my collection. The colour is good...

"I am a fan of the formula of this product but the packaging leaves something to be desired. 

The blush goes on smooth and is really easy to blend. The color is beautiful and super buildable. It lasts all day and I have not noticed any transfer at all. 

The tube that the product comes in is made out of a lower quality plastic and feels a bit cheap. I would compare it to the expected quality of a drug store brand. The applicator tip while super soft is a bit small for the intended use. I have found myself needing to use a separate brush or sponge in order to properly blend the blush in.

I recieved this product free from Influenster and Charlotte Tillbury in exchange for my honest opinion. I absolutely love the dream pop color of the Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand. I loved that it twists to lock so no product leaks out. The sponge tip allowed for easy application  and is controlled by how much you squeeze.

"I had heard such great things about Charlotte Tilbury, so I was super excited to try this blush!
Being 57 years old, I have been trying to mainly purchase cream or liquid blush, and the Charlotte Tilbury formula is terrific...not too dry and not too runny. It blends perfectly with my finger, and looks very natural. 
I received the peach color, and when I first saw how it looked when I went to apply it, I was worried that it might be too orange, but I was wrong. I love the color on me!! It looks so youthful, pretty and natural, and feels amazing! 
I am definitely a Charlotte fan for sure now!",11 Feb 2023,Amazing!,BarbJWSD,Tilbury,Blush,No

"This is brand new so I‚Äôm glad I got to try it! If you like liquid blushes, I think you‚Äôll really like this one. It is VERY concentrated so you only need a tiny (and I mean tiny) bit for your cheeks. I‚Äôm wearing Dream Pop which is a vibrant, deep, cool cherry. After you twist off the cap, make sure the arrow is pointed to the ON position then give it a little squeeze so it floats up to the sponge tip. I didn‚Äôt read the directions carefully and kept trying to squeeze it in the OFF position üòÇ. What can I say? It‚Äôs been a long week! This blends very easily without feeling or looking greasy or dewy. I like the convenience of the tube because it easily fits into your makeup bag and it‚Äôs secure. This is long wearing, cruelty free and free of Sulfates SLS and SLES. As of right now, there are only three colors in the line but I‚Äôm sure as time goes by, there will be more added depending on its popularity.

"When I first dabbed on the blush I thought, ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs bright!‚Äù Then I began blending it in. It blends really well with my existing makeup and adds a subtle pop without looking unnatural. I used my fingers to blend in as supposed to a brush. The ‚Äúon/off‚Äù dial is a nice feature so the product doesn‚Äôt get squeezed out, especially with air travel.

I bought this shade as well as the peachy pop. I love them ! I put them on top of my foundation while the foundation is still wet. I just do three dots and blend out with a damp beauty blender.

"Ok, I'm not a blush person but this is nice. So easy to apply, the formula isn't too thick or thin. The applicator is a genius idea and able to leave just enough product. The formula blends so easily into the skin and is easily buildable. The only thing I think that's giving the four stars is the price, but if you wear blush a lot, this might be worth it.

I was skeptical because of the shade and the it being a matte blush due to being a chocolate girl but the shade showed up beautifully! It didn‚Äôt try out my skin and it lasted all day.

"A little bit goes a long way. Unfortunately I found that out when I went to put some on the back of my hand and made a huge mess. It seemed more like a peachy pink.

"Idk the product maybe wasnt for me.

"I wasn‚Äôt sure how I would like this blush since I typically use cream sticks or shimmery pressed powders for my blush formulations. While the packaging is beautiful, I was a bit skeptical of how this would apply with a sponge wand tip. I thought for sure too much product would end up on my face especially since the product came out of the tube and was incredibly pigmented. Well I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised! Only a few light taps with the applicator on my cheekbones, followed by some tapping with my fingers to gently spread out and blend the product, and my blush looks just gorgeous on my cheeks. I think I actually prefer the formulation to cream sticks just because of how beautifully and seamlessly it blended out. The matte formulation isn‚Äôt too dry or flat at all, and the peach color is the most gorgeous coral hue on my light neutral skin tone. Lasted all day on me too without fading, which can happen when I use cream based. Such little product was used this will last a while. While the tub doesn‚Äôt feel like it was filled full, I still believe I will get months of daily use out of this.

I received this to try from Influenster and let me tell you I love this so much. It‚Äôs matte but still has a glowy look. it blends so well with fingers and brush. I will probably be purchasing  the other colors.,6 Feb 2023,The perfect liquid blush,samairah915,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I'm very inexperienced with liquid blush products since I'm a matte powder foundation kinda girl; so I was nervous about trying this one. I needn't have been! It blended beautifully and still shows up quite well under my pressed powder. The shade ""Pink Pop"" was perfect for my pale neutral  skin. Before I blended it out a bit with my damp beauty blender I looked like I had either been drinking a bit too much wine or had been outside in the cold wind. It was cute but a bit much for my taste. After blending it's perfect. I look forward to using it every day.",6 Feb 2023,,Isis669,Tilbury,Blush,No
The pigmentation of this matte blush is amazing.  I love the application tip but I do use a blending brush to finish it off. The on and off twist is genius so it doesn't dry out.,6 Feb 2023,Gorgeous,eddy96,Tilbury,Blush,No
So easy to blend. So pigmented. I love wearing it. A new must have!!,6 Feb 2023,,1annabanana1,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I usually use powder blushes, but I did enjoy this product! My only complaint is that if you press too hard, it‚Äôs hard to control the amount of liquid that comes out on the dabber. The closure feature on the top is great, so it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt dry out!",6 Feb 2023,Great closing feature!,ntvnyer11,Tilbury,Blush,No
Just received my Charlotte tilbury pillow talk matte blush. In shade dream pop. All you you need is the tiniest dab and use a beauty blender to blend it out. It's such a pretty shade. The packaging I really liked. The wand has a twist to lock the product in. Overall would recommend and looking forward in tryin out other softer shades,6 Feb 2023,Pretty pink shade,letti03,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I was sent this product from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury for my honest review. The packaging is smart. Easy to use applicator keeps air out of product.  The cream is pigmented, so just apply a little at first. And blend quickly as it sets quickly - do one cheek then the next.  It‚Äôs buildable so using a little first , you can add as needed.  Only three colors at this time.",6 Feb 2023,Easy application.,lys007,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I am loving this blush wand. It goes on smoothly, blends well, and is a subtle but gorgeous color. I am definitely making this one of my go to products!",6 Feb 2023,You need this blush wand!,talzy7,Tilbury,Blush,No
This blush can go from natural to glam and still blend so seamlessly that it makes you second guess if you are wearing makeup. When I dotted my cheekbones with peach pop I got a little nervous because it was much more pigmented than I had anticipated but it blended in the most beautiful natural flush. I added a couple more layers to see how the formula builds and I was able to create a dramatic look but because the formula is a softer matte it still looked light and skin-like. This stayed out and didn‚Äôt break down my skin tint for the 10 hours I had it on. This will be a staple in my makeup bag especially for this summer. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.,6 Feb 2023,From natural to glam,jaylee,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I received this product from Influenster for free in exchange for my honest opinion. 
I gravitate toward cream face products. Bronzer, highlight, blush, etc so this is right up my alley. When I first received it, I thought that the amount of product was sparse. BUT after trying it, I realize this will go a long way because you just need the tiniest dab. It looks intense when you first apply, but it blends out nicely. You do need to move quickly when blending otherwise it dries down and doesn‚Äôt budge. Staying power is excellent. Love the matte color. The wand twists to lock the product in. I didn‚Äôt notice that at first and kept squeezing with no result. Thought my wand was broken. Lol. I do appreciate that you can lock the wand so product doesn‚Äôt spill while traveling, etc. I would like to try another color in this and may purchase others. I like the convenience and ease of using these.",6 Feb 2023,Easy to Use & Apply,sylsbag,Tilbury,Blush,No
Okay so this was actually my first time trying a liquid blush. I have to admit i had mixed feeling and was a bit skeptical to be completely honest. I was shocked by how smooth and matified the blush actually turned out to be. I love how simple the applicator is and that it has an open amd close action so you can adjust the amount of blush you want to use. It dries instantly and is completely matte just as a powder blush would be.,6 Feb 2023,Love the applicator,johnnalyn91,Tilbury,Blush,No
"Tried and tested! After a full shift, my blush still looks great without any re-application. It truly lasts all day! 

I also loved the ease of using Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Matte Beauty Blush Wand. The Dream Pop color is gorgeous! It‚Äôs highly pigmented so a little goes a long way.",6 Feb 2023,Must have!,coffeegirlhere,Tilbury,Blush,No
"This is an amazing blush. But will say a little bit goes a long way with a splash. Just needed a tiny bit on the apples of my cheeks and use a beauty sponge to blend it. I tried blending it with my fingers, and it was very hard to get the pigment off. This is a very highly pigmented cream blush, but will blend with a little bit of work.",6 Feb 2023,High pigmented blush,ytink,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I enjoyed this product for the most part. It blends really well, and applies nicely. I didn‚Äôt notice that it moved my foundation, or caused any shifting. My only issue is that I am very fair, so this color is a bit too deep for me. That isn‚Äôt to say that you can‚Äôt make it work, but it does take a lot of blending. Another note is that because it is a matte formula, it dries down quickly, so I would work on one side of the face at a time.",6 Feb 2023,"Beautiful blending, dries quickly.",tcreativeblonde,Tilbury,Blush,No
I received this product as a free sample and absolutely fell in love with it! The initial color seems a bit bold but it blends out seamlessly! I will definitely repurchase once mine is gone,6 Feb 2023,Perfect creamy blush!,mmhmmcake,Tilbury,Blush,No
Excellent wear and last forever! Went on really smooth and didn‚Äôt break my sensitive skin out at all! I received for free from Charlotte and Influenster for testing purposes!,6 Feb 2023,A must have,desireeh96,Tilbury,Blush,No

I absolutely love this blush! It is so easy to put on and convenient in a one step applicator. The color is beautiful and complements my skin tone. I recommend this to anyone.,6 Feb 2023,,Suesean,Tilbury,Blush,No
My first time trying a liquid blush and I‚Äôm so pleased! This Peach Pop gives me such a beautiful glow! You can use the applicator to apply to apples of cheeks or usd fingertips as I did. The color stays put and has a nice matte finish. Love this new product I was fortunate to try!,6 Feb 2023,New favorite!!,AmySed,Tilbury,Blush,No
"On initial packaging. I thought this was adorable. Very consistent with all those Charlotte Tillberry products. However, when I went to go use it, I‚Äôm not used to a applicator like this, so I was not able to spread the blush like I normally do with a brush. It has good pigmentation, but I wasn‚Äôt really into the applicator.",6 Feb 2023,,Vgwoo,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I've been wanting to try a liquid blush after seeing them all over social so I was very excited to receive this from Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. 
The color is beautiful and so easy to apply and blend with a BeautyBlender. However the color was subtle, even on my pale skin, so some users might want to build up the tone with layers. Feels like nothing on the skin. Would be perfect for ""no makeup-makeup"" looks. 
Also the tube leaked a little bit which is odd considering the design allows you to turn it ""off.""",6 Feb 2023,Gorgeous but Subtle,MLalexis,Tilbury,Blush,No
Wow! That was my first word when trying this blush. This blush has definitely made it into my daily makeup routine. I was so excited to receive this from Influenster for an honest review. I love Charlotte Tilbury and she did not fail us on this blush. I want all the colors!,6 Feb 2023,Beautiful Color Payoff,DramaQu33n,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I absolutely adore this blush! It‚Äôs so pigmented and easy to use. It really feels like a cloud on my face. It‚Äôs perfect, because soft matte is in for 2023. I added it to my everyday essentials bag immediately after trying it. It was super easy to use, just a simple twist and gentle squeeze and the product came to the applicator. I placed three dots on each cheek and blended with a brush as it gave me best results in the past with liquid blush. I‚Äôm convinced this shade is perfect for every single skin tone, It gave me the most perfect natural flush to my cheeks, which I was pleasantly surprised with as I had been using pink/ peach toned blush‚Äôs for years. It lasted me all day long and even showed up on camera in all my zoom meetings where I got lots of compliments from peers. Didn‚Äôt need any touch ups throughout the day. If you are looking for something new to try and want a new blush, this shade is absolutely killer.",6 Feb 2023,A must have in your everyday routine!,Dinak2697,Tilbury,Blush,No
This blush was such a pleasant surprise! The shade I got was a raspberry kind of shade and complemented neutral olive skin tones so well! It also applied very easily and stayed put all day!,6 Feb 2023,,tiffanysam,Tilbury,Blush,No
I received this product for free to test out. I received the shade ‚Äúdream pop‚Äù which is a bright matte red color. I am pretty fair skinned so I was a bit scared before I tried it out. The product is very pigmented and I was very nervous upon initial application. I was able to blend it out eventually but it took a lot of time. I also don‚Äôt feel that the product wore too well.,6 Feb 2023,Decent product,EricaMaurer,Tilbury,Blush,No
"For the textured skin girls I highly recommend this product! Not only are they pigmented enough for medium to deep skin tones, which is amazing but they blend so well into the skin and honestly they blend so much better than her highlighter ones. When these come back in stock, I highly recommend purchasing them because they‚Äôre great.",6 Feb 2023,Peach Perfect,AmbiiAlexa,Tilbury,Blush,No
I love this blush. It‚Äôs my first time using a Charlotte Tilbury product and it really lives up to the hype. The color is very pigmented but blends to a beautiful blush. The product design is amazing and the application tip makes it way easier to apply the right amount. Just a little goes a long way.,6 Feb 2023,Beautiful color,JennyPernia9092,Tilbury,Blush,No
I love how this peach pop color looks on my cheeks. Glides on smooth with the brush applicator and easy to blend out. Peach pop is a coral that is perfect on any skin tone. I love how versatile this is.,6 Feb 2023,Beautiful pop of color,Xopi11,Tilbury,Blush,No
This is one of the best blushes I‚Äôve ever used! The applicator applies the product using just the right amount - and it blends beautifully. The color is perfect for a fair complexion but I imagine would look great with any skin tone.,6 Feb 2023,,Charlotz,Tilbury,Blush,No
"I have been using Charlotte Tilbury products for over a year now and have been loving them. I am also a makeup artist in Idaho and most products I use seem to dry up my clientes skin even more. When I started using Charlotte Tilbury products, my clientes immediately noticed a difference in their skin. I am so happy that this has worked for me and my clientes. These blushes are so beautiful and blend in amazing. I thought it was going to be to pink on myself since I am Mexican, but it actually looked amazing on my skin! They definitely are for everyone not just for lighter skin!",6 Feb 2023,Blends amazing on skin,Yurianachavez,Tilbury,Blush,No
"New blush. Goes on flawless, blends and builds easily. Wasn't a huge fan of the color they sent (for me) but would definitely purchase it in a different color.

I really like the shimmer wands but these are just okay. The color I got doesn‚Äôt really show up on my skin without lots of layers. It‚Äôs a bit drying. If you have oily skin you‚Äôll like this but for dry skin you really need a good dewy base to keep it from looking dry.
