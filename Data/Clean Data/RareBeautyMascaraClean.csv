This is the worst mascara I have ever purchased. It clumps in the container after one week. I was influenced by Wirecutter‚Äôs review to purchase it. Celebrities should be held to higher standards in their beauty lines. Do not waste your money. I‚Äôm thinking of  using it as polish for my boots.,Crap in a pretty container,31 Jan 2025,ck1ck1,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I like that this is created with cleaner ingredients. However for me, it clumps a bit too much. The formula is pretty thick and wet, so maybe it just doesn‚Äôt dry quite fast enough.

"I wanted to love this mascara, but it falls really short for me. First coat was barely visible on my lashes. I went in for a second, then a third‚Äîsame thing. My the fourth coat the product was visible, but now looked like a lumpy clumpy spider. I think this likely works best if you already have long voluminous lashes and simply want them to be darker, but if you have short straight lashes like me, this isn‚Äôt for you.

so the only thing that makes it not a 5 star is that it does seem to melt a little bit and if you want to have the long lash effect you need to go over quite a few times. i do like that it‚Äôs lasted me a while but i wish it didn‚Äôt melt.,Nice but i wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to buy it,30 Oct 2024,Channinggs,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

My favourite. volumizing doesn't give me racoon eyes. Tubing is usually my go to to prevent smudging but I can never find one that still gives volume. While this is not a Tubing mascara the ingredients are in the spirit of Tubing with high polymers while giving great volume. On my 2nd tube. I feel like it's the mascara that never ends. it's got 15mL in it while most have 10 mL! it's great cost wise and gives great results.,my favourite just wish it came in brown too,29 Oct 2024,AliLynnd,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I got this as a free sample with a purchase and I had to go and buy the full size. My face and eyelids are so oily and I always struggle with eyeliner and mascara flaking and smearing. This mascara did neither. It feels lightweight and comes off easily with an oil cleanser. The first thing I noticed is how volumizing and lengthening it is. Every mascara says that, but this is the first one I‚Äôve actually said ‚Äúwow‚Äù out loud about, after applying one coat. I love the boar bristle wand too, makes it easier to apply for me. Absolutely worth it! I will say maybe it doesn't hold a curl long because I can usually feel my lashes on the top of my brow bone and I cannot feel them after a couple hours wearing this mascara. That leads me to believe the curl drops after a while. It's still a stunning product though, and worth 5 stars.",Stunning,6 Oct 2024,AbbeyH37,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"The best way I could describe this is that it reminds me of the Wet n‚Äô Wild formula of the late 1980s (have not tried it since) that my mother would get when I had sleepovers so that a bunch of nine year olds would not ruin her makeup goving makeouvers.  It somehow manages to be both watery and dry at the same time, is absolutely clumpy and gives major tarantula lash.  Instead of keeping your lashes hydrated is dried out and starts flaking off in those spider like clumps, making it look even worse.  I admit I am particular about my mascara as I expect it to perform, not make me look like an arachnid.  This is a huge miss.",Trash in a tube,29 Sep 2024,jbh79,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

It helps you achieve a volumized look, but  it tended to transfer from my lower lashes to my under eye and I'd forget, so by the end of a work day I looked like I was crying or sweating off my mascara. I don't know if that's my anatomy or the formula of the product. Never found a way to stop it, just had to remember to wipe under my eyes a few times during the day. It's a shame because I really like Selena Gomez and want to believe she makes quality products. It could be that I purchased a weird batch or waited to long to use it after purchasing it. It has pros and cons (not just cons).",B- mascara,23 Sep 2024,sonyaelena,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"This is my holy grail! Not only does it extend and curl my lashes, but it also makes them much more prominent. I have deep set eyes and this makes my eyes pop. I usually only need one coat.

"**Product Review: Mascara That Irritates Eyes**

Unfortunately, this mascara was a huge disappointment. After applying it, I noticed small particles flaking off throughout the day, and they would often get into my eyes. As someone who wears contacts, this was especially irritating. The mascara caused constant discomfort and left my eyes red and watery, making it impossible to wear comfortably for more than a few hours. It didn‚Äôt hold up well either, smudging and flaking after only a short time. Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this mascara, particularly for contact lens wearers or anyone with sensitive eyes.",Irritates eyes,21 Sep 2024,DSG10,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"Out of all the Rare Beauty products I've tried and returned, Perfect Strokes stands out. It has an excellent formula that doesn't flake or smudge, and it holds a curl well while also providing volume and lengthening lashes. The black shade is rich and dark; one coat is enough for a natural look. The formula doesn't clump or make lashes look spikey when applying a second coat.   Considering most luxury beauty brands' mascaras cost between $30 and $50 these days and don't work nearly as well, Perfect Strokes is a bargain.

"This is the worst mascara I have used in a long time.  What a mess!  It is thick, clumpy and gets everywhere.... the only way I can make it work is to almost completely wipe off the wand  before applying (waste of product) or go back in with a clean spoolie to make it look normal and then clean up my eyelids afterwards (waste of time).

Maybe it gets better as the formula dries out, but after 2 weeks of opening it is still almost unusable.  I'm going back to Tower 28 which never disappoints from Day 1.

"I recently tried this mascara, and I couldn't be happier with my experience! Applying it to my eyelashes is a breeze, and the results are fantastic. The formula gives my lashes great length and volume without clumping, which is something I truly appreciate.

The price is incredibly reasonable, especially considering the quality of the product. I've already purchased it twice, and I even received a sample that I took with me while traveling. It was perfect for on-the-go touch-ups and just as effective as the full-size version.

"I have hooded lids and puffy undereyes, so product transfer is a real issue for me.

"This might be the worst mascara to ever exist. It certainly is the worst one I have ever used. I have long black lashes, and usually any mascara makes them look more defined and lifted. This one requires a million coats to build up, looks clumpy and flaky simultaneously, and does not do anything good for the lashes. My lashes looked better curled and without anything else on them, than with this. Not sure what the hype is? I am usually a makeup hoarder, but this has gotta go straight in the trash. Any drugstore mascara will  be better. I like Lash paradise by Loreal for drug store, and the OneSize one for higher end!!",Quite possibly the worst,29 Mar 2024,KM1231,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"Easy to build upon, very dark, lengthening and thickening. I will say, if you have temperamental eyelashes like me, and they want to stick out straight and not curl, this mascara is a little heavy.

It has no lift at all",Would rather buy drugstore,10 Mar 2024,missbliss1,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"This mascara was a total disappointment. Comparing it to the drug store mascaras, they beat this by a mile. First off, the wand. The wand of this mascara is way too big, causing your lashes to clump together. It takes in way too much mascara at once, and also weighs down your lashes instead of lifting them.
Next is just the formula itself. The mascara is very very clumpy and thick. My lashes droop from
this and feel heavy, even after one coat. It doesn‚Äôt lengthen or curl. The mascara has bits in it that also cause it to clump together, so you only have like 5 lashes. This was a total disappointment, I‚Äôll go back to using cheaper mascaras. The mini was also a. rip off, it was tiny. Overall, I do not recommend this mascara at all. It doesn‚Äôt give my lashes a boost at all and was very heavy. Do not buy.",Not good,9 Mar 2024,icanhelppp,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
I expected this Mascara to be less heavy on the wand. I had to wipe off the excess each time I used it. It needed to be separated once applied with a spooling.

"This mascara gives awesome volume and length to your lashes without clumping them together or covering them in product. I always get compliments when I use this product and I think it universally enhances lash length and fullness.

I have used this mascara for about a year and it just ran out on me, so that shows how much use you can get out of it! I wish the brush were a little more hourglass shaped to help with separation of lashes, but overall this is an awesome product. One of my favorite mascaras and one of my favorite rare beauty products.

It isn't water proof but honestly I've cried with this on and it stays put. I do like that when you use cleansing balm, it comes off quite easily without damaging lashes.

Well, all the others had cons that outweighed the pros. Then, I finally opened Perfect Strokes and I have never been happier with a mascara! The brush is fat and bristly, which allows it to grab every one of my lashes (mine are sparse, short and flat). The formula is creamy, but not thick.

"Look. I never leave reviews ever for makeup products because no. But this mascara has changed my life. It does dry up pretty quickly like max 4 months but within those 3-4 months I get the best results. It‚Äôs buildable. It‚Äôs dark. It‚Äôs silky. It smells like nothing (unlike other brands that smell chemically). It doesn‚Äôt flake, and it comes off in the shower nicely. I have short and thin lashes and use a very thin thin eyeliner to put emphasis on the mascara and often times it doesn‚Äôt matter for other mascara brands how thin the line is. The mascara is bad. But Rare Beauty has it together. It‚Äôs fabulous. I know it isn‚Äôt for everyone but my goddddddddd it‚Äôs amazing for me. I will never buy another brand of mascara and I‚Äôve tried at least a dozen if not more. It makes my lashes pop. I use three layers on the top lashes and two on the bottom and it never clumps. I am so glad she decided to make a makeup brand because I was so defeated with mascaras and Sephora had a sample size for their point system so I decided to try it for free. Y‚Äôall. If you have thin lashes, this is it for you. It‚Äôs so refreshing to feel seen for my lashes. It isn‚Äôt going to add length but because of how it goes on, it feels like it‚Äôs added length. I cannot rave enough for this mascara. Buy it. If you don‚Äôt like it, return it.

"I really wanted to like this, and gave it so many chances, but it consistently disappointed time and time again. It's somehow clumpier than every single cheap drugstore mascara I've ever tried, it doesn't lengthen at all---whether or not you separate the lashes out, apply more pressure, or layer it---and I often found myself trying to rescue it by using another mascara's more defining applicator to clean up the appearance. All in all, heavy, clumpy, and too expensive to be so bad. Maybe I got a bad formula?

"i have been using this mascara for the last couple of weeks now. i absolutely adore it. love the ease of application, it makes my lashes look amazing and i think it is reasonably priced. plus.. it doesn‚Äôt smudge/flake! i have recently been struggling with my eyes randomly getting incredibly watery/itchy & red. i honestly thought this was just due to seasonal allergies. eye drops didn‚Äôt help. allergy medicines didn‚Äôt help. i figured it had to be something i was putting on my fave no? at first i blamed it on a new sunscreen i really liked but i have worn it on no-makeup days and zero issue. i realized everytime i put this mascara on, my eyes would start getting irritated at some point in the day. the second i removed the mascara? issue gone. so yeah‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt think it works for me. :( lowkey sad but it looks amazing so i would definitely recommend trying it. #biebersucks","looks great, love it, doesn‚Äôt work for me :(",26 Jun 2023,lizzyybethhe,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I even took a nap and no smudges. My lashes still look full after all day wear and the formula is light but still noticeable.

2. Dries out really quickly/does not last long at all

It‚Äôs literally $20 for an average mascara. I‚Äôm a stickler for branding (aka I spend way too much money on here) but mascara is just one of those products that you‚Äôre better off saving on if you have decent natural lashes or extensions.

Otherwise, go buy yourself some Lanc√¥me Lash Idole, Hourglass (either), or Ilia mascara and call it a day. I have tried every mascara out there. This ain‚Äôt my first rodeo.

They look like light, feathery false lashes. They create the effect of a dark line along the base of the top lid, which I like (like where the glued on part of falsies would be) and the mascara lengthens the lashes to the eyebrows (for me).

So difficult to apply without creating a a clumpy mess of overly exaggerated eyelashes.

Wiggle and swoop up.  When I do this I get no clumps.  This mascara can be layered when doing it like that as well.  

My other favorite is Lancome, I wear it for more natural look.  However, this mascara is drama.  The good kind.  Almost every time I wear it people ask if I'm wearing false lashes.

Idk if I got a bad stopper or what but the way it gunks up on the wand makes it impossible to not give you basically one giant clump of lashes. Go to comb through the mess? More clump and also flakes. I tried everything. Let it dry for a couple weeks? Still the same problems. 

The one time (and I seriously mean one) I got this to comb through decently, my lashes looked pretty good! It was voluminous and very black. But it's not worth all the effort and extra time it would take to use a lash comb to do something that the mascara itself should do. 

I wanted so badly to love this but it's a no from me. Save your money. I'm back with my Tower28 mascara and I'm never abandoning it again.",The One Time Rare Beauty Let Me Down,13 Feb 2023,iflores1025,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"This is truly a great mascara. I don‚Äôt notice the flakyness that I‚Äôve experienced with other popular mascaras. I‚Äôm also sensitive to the mascaras that have a weird odor, and this one does not have that. It accentuates my lashes and I‚Äôm so happy it‚Äôs become a staple in my routine!",,13 Feb 2023,brittcerv14,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

It's an amazing mascara!!!!! loved it!!!! makes your eyelashes looks so good and full üòç And the best thing i like about it is that it comes off easily. Not like other mascaras which stay stuck in your lashes or creates clumps.,,11 Feb 2023,navjk,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I‚Äôve never had such a hard time applying as mascara as I do with this one. It is extremely hard to apply and not get all over your eyelid. I‚Äôve never ever gotten mascara all over my lid like this mascara causes but it is so (the wand) bulky that it‚Äôs hard not to get everywhere. On top of that the formula is dry as heck and flakes off like crazy throughout the day. Big waste of $20.,Messy & Flakey,8 Feb 2023,AshleyCMartin,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I bought this mascara because I wanted to stop using a ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù mascara, as I noticed they made my eyelashes fall out once I got all of it off. So, I looked up washable mascaras and Rare Beauty seemed generally well liked among mascara lovers. I got the last full size at my local Sephora, and I was lucky because I love this mascara now. It applies so nicely, although it does clump a little, but nothing that a spoolie can‚Äôt fix easily. It lengthens my lashes so much and adds a good amount of volume too. Overall one of my favorite washable mascaras that last all day.",Love love love!,3 Feb 2023,byrdye,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"The best mascara I've ever used. It goes on smoothly. No clumps or flaking. I don't like any of my eyelashes stuck together so I run through them after application with a dry wand. I love that I can ""brush out"" my lashes after application to get great separation and volume without it flaking or reapplication necessary. It comes off the skin really easily as well.

Wow!! I was shocked at how much volume my lashes got after only one coat. The price is pretty close to my drugstore one but way better in quality.

"Okay, so I love having long extension looking lashes, but because I‚Äôm allergic to eyelash extension glue, I‚Äôve been trying out tons of different mascaras. The result? Selena doesn‚Äôt play around. This mascara beats roller ball, better than sex, legit lashes, hypnose, idole, and several of the yves  saint Laurent mascaras. Perfect strokes makes my eyelashes look so long and gorgeous. With one layer, they lengthen my eyelashes noticeably without clumping. I haven‚Äôt noticed any issues with flaking or smudging throughout the day, and while it‚Äôs not waterproof, I prefer that since I don‚Äôt have to be rough when removing it.","Best mascara, hands down, ever",17 Jan 2023,adriask,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"I LOVE rare beauty, but this mascara just wasn't for me. The formula is very wet (one blink and it was on my eyelid), the wand collects alot of product (too much where I had to wipe some off the wand to avoid a large clump), and the wand is very large (hard to get into the low inner corner lashes).

"Oh man I wanted to love this mascara so badly, but I was sadly let down. I have been a lancome mascara girlie for four years now and I decided to try this because of all of the hype I have seen online. I have straightish lashes and I use a curler then apply the mascara with two coats. I dont HATE it but I don't love it. It doesn't seem to hold the curl throughout the day and the formula reminds me of Maybelline Great Lash mascara.. you know, the one with the pink and green bottle that you most likely owned at one point in your life. Maybe it works better for people with fuller lashes that have some curl? I don't know. But for me, I don't think I will repurchase.",Didn't live up to the hype imo,14 Jan 2023,bfav91,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"Was really excited to give this a try but it‚Äôs a painfully average mascara. You can definitely find better in the drugstore. It didn‚Äôt do anything magical for me, didn‚Äôt lengthen or provide any volume but I will give it this, it did a terrific job at not smudging.

"I actually love this mascara. I‚Äôll be honest- I‚Äôm 43 years old and it‚Äôs a Selena Gomez product, so I was feeling a bit too mature for this one. Then, I read an article where the young lady was rating products by their staying power after she wore them on a summer day at Disney World. As a Floridian, I was intrigued to know what made it through the humidity riddled, pouring rain in the afternoon, oppressively hot day and this mascara got high marks. And the price was right to give it a shot. Boy, I am glad I did. This stuff stays on through my most grueling work shifts (operating room RN), followed by intense workouts and still doesn‚Äôt smear all over the place. And, it‚Äôs pretty easy to remove when I am ready for that. Selena, girl, sorry I had my doubts- but I‚Äôm on board now.",I ‚ù§Ô∏è this mascara,30 Dec 2022,rn23563,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
This is the best mascara I have ever used.  My mascara typically transfers everywhere no matter what I do.  However this mascara stays put and it is not hard to take off.  I no longer get racoon eyes after only a couple hours of wear.  Only thing I recommend is to get the excess product off of the wand before applying or else a lot of clumps will appear.

This a clumpy mascara that does a poor job at separating and lengthening lashes. Its volumizing abilities come down to coating lashes in a ton of product and clumping them together.

"This mascara is very clumpy, glues the eyelashes together, so that I need to use another clean brush to brush out the clumps and unstick the eyelashes from one another.

"I love Miss Selena, but I'm not impressed with this mascara. :( This is the only Rare Beauty Product I've tried, so I can't attest to the rest of the brand, but I'm very picky about my mascaras. I have long lashes, but they are thin and I need lots of volume. But, this mascara pretty much from day one was very clumpy for me and I have to manipulate it a lot to get it to look good. It's also very hard to wash off for a mascara that claims it isn't waterproof. Like, my oil cleansing balm doesn't get all of this mascara off and there's always black smudges under my eyes which I only comes off from the second part of double cleanse, which hasn't been an issue with any other mascaras ever. I was really looking forward to trying this mascara out but I guess it just isn't for me.","Eh, don't understand the hype",21 Nov 2022,cerins,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I really love this mascara! It took me some time to get used to because you have to wipe a bit off the brush to avoid clumping but it‚Äôs a phenomenal mascara! No smudging, easy to apply, and gives great definition and fullness to lashes. I haven‚Äôt figured out how to apply it without getting it on my eye lid and I have never had that issue with other mascaras. Just requires some clean-up after application but it‚Äôs a great product.",Great mascara! Requires a bit of clean-up,2 Nov 2022,NolitaBella,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I love this mascara! It lengthens and makes my lashes look so good. My only issue is it dries out after a bit. I guess that makes you need to purchase a new tube before it expires.

"I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.  I have barely there lashes and was shocked at how thick it made my lashes look after one coat. It also didn‚Äôt weigh my lashes down like some mascara formulas do which I love and held the curl from the eyelash curler.  Overall, I really like this mascara and will probably be purchasing it again.",Really ended up liking it,30 Sep 2022,SportyGirly125,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I was so surprised by this mascara! I got a sample size with my rewards points. It does give really good volume and lift - 2 coats gives me the dramatic volume I am looking for! I wish it gave more length to my short lashes. Also because my lashes are short the ""eye hugging brush"" tends to get mascara on my top lid if I'm not super careful - usually only in the places I put my liquid liner, so not a huge deal, but it's gotten crazy at times. I notice very minimal running/smudging onto my lower lash line (could be me- I often tear up at work) But stays put otherwise. Easy to remove at night with micellar water. Overall a really good mascara! I wouldn't repurchase because the brush shape doesn't work for me, but I definitely recommend it if you have longer lashes!",A really good mascara!,23 Sep 2022,Joreyslays,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"I didn‚Äôt expect to love this mascara as much as I do so I bought the sample size. I have long lashes but they‚Äôre very straight. I normally don‚Äôt like volumizing mascara formulas or bristle brushes hence why my expectations were low here. My biggest issue with mascaras though is my eye area is very oily so everything smudges on me and turns me into a raccoon, even tubing mascaras. This is the first mascara that somehow doesn‚Äôt smudge. At. All. Never in all my makeup wearing years have I experienced not looking like a panda at the end of the day. It‚Äôs also beautifully lengthening, gives some volume AND doesn‚Äôt weigh down my curl at all. Unexpected holy grail.",Obsessed.,22 Sep 2022,VictoriaJ5,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I constantly have to wipe it off and reapply which is so time consuming. Once I have it on it looks so clumpy. I‚Äôve also noticed it makes my eyes burn throughout the day, which has never happened to me before. My eyes water so badly when I wear this one. I‚Äôm not sure why that is.

"This mascara is very hard to work with in my opinion. Bought it due to all the amazing reviews on YouTube, but for me it clumps so badly and I definitely cannot start applying it to my lashes straight from the tube. The only way it doesn‚Äôt look clumpy is when I scrape the wand on the side of the tube several times. It does look good if wipe off the wand several times and use a light hand, and it lasts well on my lashes.

This mascara clumps. The product is difficult to use because the mascara formula seems quite thick and the wand is really bushy. I can achieve the look I want about 33% of the time but it takes a lot of patience and a really delicate hand.

The formula is thin for me. I have average lashes all around. But I have found mascaras that make my lashes look great. I have to stick with what works. This just did not give me any volume or thickness. Only plus is that is does not give me racoon eyes and seems to come off easily when washed. I'm going back to the Lancome line.,Doesn't do much for me.,18 Jul 2022,nearmissy,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"I was using the Ilia mascara for the longest time, I decided to try this one since there was a lot of hype about it and omg... the hype is REAL! Or should I say Rare... lol.

Anyways, this mascara makes me look like I have false lashes, it evenly coats and separates the lashes so they look fuller and longer (after 2 coats, that is)! No clumping whatsoever, and they feel light/feathery on the eyes as if I'm not wearing anything on them. Once it completely dries down it doesn't transfer or flake off, which is a big plus because I like to play with/touch my lashes throughout the day to push them upward. 

All I can say is thank you miss Selena!! Another great product to add to my collection (:",thank you miss Selena,17 Jul 2022,Monikuuhhh,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I'm so impressed with this product and it will definitely replace my current mascara. Really happy I tried this.",You Need This,3 Jun 2022,natalie33,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
Very disappointed. It‚Äôs very clumpy and not volumizing at all. Hard to wash off as well.,,3 Jun 2022,MrsSparks87,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"Really great formula, without being cloyingly thick or sticky. I love it for a no makeup look when I only wear SPF, blush and mascara. However, the product keeps collecting when you reach to push the wand in to close the mascara tube. Because of this, a lot of the ink spills and stains the sides of the tube. Me no likey. Please change the design! Fantastic product otherwise","Amazing product, bad design",3 Jun 2022,crisook,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"It seems as though I have been looking forever for a mascara that gives my lashes volume and length but doesn‚Äôt flake or smudge.  I‚Äôd given up hope to the point that I stopped even wearing mascara at all the last couple of years.  Along came a recommendation from a Sephora sales associate for Rare Beauty.  It has everything I want in a mascara including being LONG wearing without flakes or residue under my eyes.  Like other reviewers have said, it can clump.  All I do is a quick swipe with my steel eyelash comb and the clumps are gone.  I‚Äôve worn the mascara for 18+ hours with no problem.  It washes off easily with my regular cleanser and wash cloth.  This stuff is great!",Best I have found in YEARS!,2 Jun 2022,alison961,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
I went to Sephora a few months back and the sales lady turned me onto this mascara and I have been buying it ever sense. They were promoting this mascara and the price was right and still is. I‚Äôve tried many different mascaras and so far this is one of the best. I will continue to buy rare beauty by Selena Gomez. Thank you so much,Love some rare beauty,1 Jun 2022,guittar1,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
Omg when I tell you this is the Number 1 best mascara ever used!Then it‚Äôs the best.First of all it Lengthen and curly my eyelashes very beautifully.It is a really black mascara which is a stand! And will SEPARATE YOUR EYELASHES ! Which is a big advantage for some people who have a problem with clumpy lashes.I personally don‚Äôt like too clumpy mascara but I don‚Äôt mind a little bit clumpy.But I HIGHLY recommend this mascara and for all those people who said ‚Äúthis is the best mascara‚Äù for drug store mascaras and others.

"Literally one of the best mascaras I‚Äôve ever used! Doesn‚Äôt bleed onto eyelids after a full day of wear, it isn‚Äôt clumpy at all, and the brush lengthens and volumizes your lashes all in one!

"I'm really impressed! 

I came in wanting my favorite Monsieur Big Waterproof mascara, but it was sold out. I needed something long-wearing and good for stubbornly straight lashes, so the associate recommended this! I was skeptical, but I really love it! It's a very rich black, it's long wearing, and it holds a curl so well! One star off because it is difficult to remove (even with an oil based cleanser and a double cleanse) and tends to be a little bit clumpy, but you can circumvent that by wiping the wand off before applying. I think that that makes the experience of using this a little bit inelegant, but I do think I'd purchase it again because it's good at all that it claims to do!",,22 May 2022,AvaEmily,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"Let me say I was surprised! I now keep a travel size in my makeup pouch. This mascara is so good it‚Äôs not even waterproof & it does not smudge!!

My favorite mascara of all time. I‚Äôm on my 2nd tube and I‚Äôm truly in love. It‚Äôs very long lasting and keeps my lashes lifted. I love how it‚Äôs a dry formula but it‚Äôs not flaky AT ALL. So easy to use and build up. Doesn‚Äôt irritate my sensitive eyes. Just the best.,The Goat.,21 May 2022,sydddxo,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"One of the best mascaras I‚Äôve ever tried, not only does it make my lashes voluminous but this is the best mascara to cry in. I‚Äôve ugly cried with this mascara various times and not once did the mascara start running all over the place, it always stayed put. Best part about it is that it‚Äôs not waterproof and easily to remove.",One of the best,20 May 2022,Judithgarciaax6,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"Received this in an Allure Beauty Box and, while it is a great, straight-forward volumizing mascara, I‚Äôm surprised to see almost no reviews mention how WET it is. Even with wiping off excess from the spoolie and applying carefully, I get a speck dripping onto my cheek or eyelid every single time. That said, it really is a good mascara and it‚Äôs become my go-to on days I do my eyes first so I know I‚Äôll be able to wipe off any drops.",,19 May 2022,LibbyJS,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"I've tried over 50 mascaras in my life and this one is by far the best. The mascara is long lasting and does not ""melt"" or create dark spots around the eye. I stopped using mascara for years because it would make my lashes fall out. This one doesn't. I've seen alot of negative comments on the excessive amount of mascara on the brush. I am just being gentle when applying and haven't had any issue with the excess amount of product.",,18 May 2022,Joliejoly,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"So, I absolutely love this mascara but it definitely does have some faults. I love that my eyes don‚Äôt become irritated by it throughout the day and that it doesn‚Äôt leave me with darkness on my under eye. The faults being that: It does pick up ALOT of product so beware of it clumping. A spoolie could easily solve the issue. Overall, a pretty great mascara!",,18 May 2022,mamarisa,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"This mascara is amazing. I stopped wearing mascara because it made my lashes fall out, but I tried using Selena's mascara and it is the best. My only issue is is that the brush picks up a lot of the actual mascara, so I have to wipe off some of it from the brush because it tends to clump on it. Otherwise, this mascara gives your lashes a clean look and does not leave a smokey look under your eyes after wearing it for a while.",,16 May 2022,paulagjoka,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"I bought this mascara looking for something natural for everyday, and did not expect to love it this much!!! I have such issues with mascara running all over my face, and this one does not.

It dries so well and makes my lashes look the longest and gives the most volume out of all the ones I‚Äôve tried.

Very clumpy and gives you short spider lashes. Probably works if you have fake lashes but it‚Äôs terrible on natural lashes.,,2 May 2022,amdrx,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
Idk if I got a bad one but part of the wand had little strings [I don‚Äôt know the correct word to use] sticking out it wasn‚Äôt how it‚Äôs supposed to look. This mascara made my eyelashes stick together.  They looked like those spider eyelashes from back in the day. I‚Äôm really upset because everyone says this is the best mascara. 20 dollars down the drain. Worst mascara I‚Äôve ever used. Also a ton of product comes out when you open it.,Disappointed,1 May 2022,beccadeee,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"As someone with a carmine allergy it's extremely difficult to find a good mascara that doesn't irritate my eyes. This is fantastic!! Dark, inky black lashes instantly. Gives a full volume effect & lengthens. Lasts all day through hectic hospital and clinic days. Looks as close to false lashes as possible. This is not for those looking for a barely there lash or are not used to wearing make-up. Some comments say this is ""clumpy"", but it most definitely is not. Plenty of time to apply full coats before drying.

This product had a high star rating so I thought I'd give it a go. I will be returning: this mascara is clumpy on the brush and does not add length: it goes on thick and leaves flakes. My lashes look straight and covered in product. It feels like it's drying? I have trouble getting it off and find that it's still coating my lashing the next day. I have to use a much stronger makeup remover instead of my usual cleansers and I don't love that.,,10 Apr 2022,katyharding,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I wanted to love it. I wanted to so badly, especially based off the reviews. Maybe I had a faulty batch. Mine clumped which was not what I was expecting. I fixed it by running a clean spool. I thought that was the end. It wasn‚Äôt. This mascara flakes and does it throughout the day. Very disappointed. On top of this, my naturally semi to long curly lashes were BLEH. Even if I took the time to curl(made the exception).

"I just had my lash extensions taken off and this was one of the mascaras friends had recommended! I got the trial size first and it worked so well I got the full size. I find it adds length but also helps with volume a bit as well, the only thing is that after being open for a bit it feels like it gets dry quite easily. I‚Äôve been using it almost everyday so maybe the air is getting trapped in the tube, but otherwise no complaints!",Perfect for post-lash extensions,8 Apr 2022,cwittur,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I don‚Äôt typically repurchase mascaras. After I use one up, I‚Äôm off to find a completely new one because I never really find one that ‚Äúwows‚Äù me. BUT this one did. Love the thickness and volume it creates!

The ONE con is that I can‚Äôt put too much of this product at the very end of my lashes. If I do, it will cause the tips to curl back and look strange (if you know, you know). So I have to use a lengthening mascara to coat the very ends. I usually would use two mascaras anyway, so this wasn‚Äôt a big deal to me.",LOVE,2 Apr 2022,Clairebear2525,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"It is a great mascara - gives volume to my lashes, is super black and it doesn't smudge through out the day",love it,2 Apr 2022,VanessaSharma,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"This is absolutely my new favourite mascara. I was looking around for something that would give me a ‚Äòfalse lash look‚Äô and an associate suggested this. I‚Äôm not in particular a Selena Gomez fan, not that I dislike her, but I had never really thought about her make up line and probably wouldn‚Äôt have if it wouldn‚Äôt have been suggested! So happy it was because it‚Äôs amazing.",If You Like Them Big,1 Apr 2022,MegannB86,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"This mascara lifts and holds my straight, downward-pointing lashes like no other. It hasn't clumped after 2 months of use and coats evenly, giving plenty of volume. But the lift! It does smudge a bit by the end of the day, but I've yet to find a mascara that doesn't. Worth it!",Honestly so good,1 Apr 2022,loralotus,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"I have struggled my whole adult life (and I'm 41 so that's a loooooong time) to find the perfect mascara. For whatever reason, I am massively prone to raccoon eyes despite having normal to dry skin. And I am a natural redhead, so anything clumpy or thick legit makes me look like a corpse. For the longest time, I had one drugstore mascara that was decent for me, but they changed the formula and I started getting raccoon eyes, so with a heavy heart (and with black circles that made me look like I was ready to play quarterback for the Rams or something), I went back to the drawing board. This mascara  is IT. It is everything. It is life. It curls your lashes, it never clumps, and I swear it elongates them, too. This mascara is the holiest of holy grails. I am half tempted to erect a temple to celebrate and worship its greatness.","I look like a goddess, not a trash panda",1 Apr 2022,tiffytoufans,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I LOVE this mascara! This is my second purchase of it and it has yet to disappoint me.

"I cannot say enough about this mascara. I have tried a lot in different price ranges. No burning, very very little flaking if at all, it doesn‚Äôt smear, you don‚Äôt need a lot and the consistency is great for shaping, lengthening and thickening. It comes off easily.",,31 Mar 2022,Godblessall,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
I‚Äôve used almost every mascara out there and this is one of the best! I have long lashes but I like some volume and this provides exactly that. The formula is great and goes on smoothly and it doesn‚Äôt dry up and flake off throughout the day. The brush is nicely shaped to help cover the lashes and provide volume. Highly recommend!,Great mascara and doesn‚Äôt flake!,31 Mar 2022,laceydc,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
One of the best mascaras that I have used in the past year. Doesn‚Äôt transfer to bottom lashes. Provides me with length & volume.,,31 Mar 2022,jen101,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"Honestly, I didn‚Äôt know what to expect with this, it‚Äôs claims aren‚Äôt anything crazy. It‚Äôs not guaranteeing you mega volume or an alternative to lash extension lengthiness. 

I‚Äôve tried all sorts of mascaras in different price ranges, and I have to say I‚Äôm impressed. It‚Äôs not an ultra wet formula, which I prefer. It doesn‚Äôt clump the more you build with it. It lengthens my lashes nicely, and gives me the right amount of volume. It doesn‚Äôt smudge, or flake off throughout the day. I feel like even while wearing my glasses my lashes look nice and full. 

Will be repurchasing.","Honestly, this mascara pleasantly surprised me.",31 Mar 2022,kennedyyrenee,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"This is the one for me, thank you so MUCH SELENA GOMEZ. It‚Äôs the ONLY non-waterproof mascara I‚Äôve bought that doesn‚Äôt leave me looking like a raccoon at the end of the day. Literally no smudges, no giant flakes under my eyes, the perfect length and volume. It looks absolutely amazing, I do wish it held my curl up for longer but honestly no mascara I‚Äôve ever tried was able to hold my curls up for more than 10mins. This one can for about an hour if I curl it after it‚Äôs all dry. Speaking of dry, the formula is the perfect amount of wet and dry. It‚Äôs not too wet that it clumps immediately and brings down your lashes but it‚Äôs only not that dry that it won‚Äôt do anything and you have to struggle to get the product on.

This is absolutely perfect. DONT EVER CHANGE THIS FORMULA. 

The only mascara that has come close to this is the Lash Princess by essence which is still nice and inexpensive but always leaves me with black under eyes. A close combo is also the L‚ÄôOr√©al voluminous curved brushed + Maybelline Sky High BUT that combo I save for big day events because it is a pain to wipe off.

Speaking of brushes and wiping off- my god this mascara is so easy to take off, I use the makeup eraser with water and that‚Äôs all it needs. Reminds me of the simplicity of the EmCosmetics mascara. ALSO I struggled with the wand at first because it‚Äôs so fluffy but after the third day I finally got the hang of these bristles. SO HAPPY, I absolutely LOVEEEEE Rare Beauty, it‚Äôs an honor to live in an era where one of my favorite people on the planet has a makeup brand!

Too Long to read:

Pros
-doesn‚Äôt smudge one bit even after a 9 hour wear day, or a humid sweaty day
-lengthens the curls and fills up gaps very nicely
-separates lashes nicely
-easy to take off 
-dries down fairly quickly 
-layering it only makes it better

"Alright.......... 
So I really didn't believe the hype around this product and essentially refused to buy it for quite some time. I haven't had one issue with any Rare Beauty item and I've purchased a LOT of their products so I was expecting at least one thing to be a dud. I typically wear the Monsieur Big, but have to opt out for waterproof since I have a leaky right eye and that mascara is IMPOSSIBLE to get out completely, and always rips out lashes even with a gel remover. On the other hand, this mascara isn't waterproof but does not, and I repeat, NOT leave marks under my eyes and it also doesn't flake off on my face. It's also super easy to remove. This mascara both voluminizes and lenghtens my lashes and makes them look so great. And to top it all off, 26$ (CAD) for a mascara is really inexpensive for a Non-Sephora Sephora brand. And the cherry on top is the amazing things that this brand does for mental health awareness.",This might even take the win for best mascara!,13 Mar 2022,Amalia3,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I used to think I didnt like mascaras until I tried this, every other mascara i tried only lasted a few hours, were super hard to remove and just weren't great. But the rare beauty mascara is my new holy grail!

it lengths, and curls my lashes which are very straight and short, it completly transforms them!

-Lengths lashes
-Curls lashes
-Easy to remove
-Long lasting Length & Curl

I am truly obsessed with this mascara. I have been using too faced for YEARS and never thought I would switch. I tried the small size out of curiosity as I have been loving all Rare's other products.

"Racoon eyes are the bane of my existence.  I have very dark circles naturally, and every mascara I have tried (so so many!) runs and smudges on me, leaving me with racoon eyes.  So I have racoon eyes naturally and then even with makeup on because of mascara.  (Bobbi Brown No Smudge has worked in the past for me but good luck trying to get any.  Always out.)  So I tried this and it's been GREAT.  I love the length it adds to my lashes. I even like what it does to my uncurled lashes.  And it barely smudges even without finishing powder under my eyes to lock in corrector and concealer.

I don‚Äôt get the hype behind this mascara‚Ä¶. Sure it‚Äôs bold with a few coats and it‚Äôs lengthening but it‚Äôs also a sticky and dry formula. With most mascaras it starts to be sticky and spidery after a few coats but with this one it is spidery with the very first swipe. There are also little ball clumps that stick on to my lashes and I have to use ky fingers to pick them off. I guess I prefer a more smooth formula that may take a bit longer to dry than this one because I can swipe the formula through my lashes without worrying they will stick together or be left with black clumps all over.

The lashes on the outer corners of my eyes started locking together, and honestly, it looked like my eyelashes weren't even there.

And then, after that while, flakes start happening.

"This is honestly probably the best mascara I have ever used for my sparse almost non-existent lashes. It‚Äôs almost like a miracle product. I usually use Lanc√¥me Hypnose Drama and recently started using Upgraded Lashes by Wander Beauty and those have been by far the best for my type of lashes but this Rare Beauty mascara is probably going to be the one I used the most now. First of all, I have very thin slick lashes that nothing sticks to. Most mascara just slides over them leaving nothing behind. All the mascaras people rave about do nothing for me. But this stuff makes them instantly black and without much effort and you can actually SEE it for a change! It is thick and may be clumpy to people with thicker or longer lashes but for someone like me who has almost none, it‚Äôs nothing short of a miracle product. With this being a celebrity brand I hope it doesn‚Äôt fade away too soon because this mascara is hoard worthy. I also love the thick feeling tube it comes in. I‚Äôm so thankful my Allure box introduced me to this!! Same way I found the Upgraded Lashes mascara also. OH! This mascara also seems semi-waterproof. Not completely but it takes a little more effort to get it off. But none of that crumbling you usually get with waterproof mascara. Okay I will shut up now.

I‚Äôm very picky when it comes to most of the things, but mascara is especially tough, I shop at least once a month hunting for new product because I‚Äôm blonde and my lashes are not the greatest, they are very short and fine. So mascara is crucial for my look and holds very important place in my make up bag. 
I normally try to stay away from celebrity brands as I have a feeling it‚Äôs more of a hype based around the person themselves rather than actual quality of products, but this one got me rethink that.

"I've tried so many mascaras, and have never found a holy Grail. They've either been slightly too clumpy, flake out rub off, or just don't do enough. But this one is beautiful. It's volumizing but still keeps great definition of each lash, giving me a full but wispy look. If I accidentally rub my eyes it doesn't smudge. And I have super oily eyelids that typically deteriorate my mascara after a few hours, and this one doesn't do that!",Perfect balance between full and wispy,10 Jan 2022,EliseLundy,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
I like a subtle mascara look. I have long but thin lashes. I used to do multiple (& I mean multiple) coats of mascara but when it came time to take off I had to wipe and wipe. I love this mascara for its wand and formula. I have  Asian eyes ( you know it get full of product) and thankfully this mascara doesn‚Äôt rub on my lid. With a few more coats I‚Äôm positive you can achieve the FULL VOLUME look. I use one dip to coat both lashes and with some to spare on the wand. It is affordable I believe it is done with no harm to animals. For those reason and because Selena made it: is why this will be my forever mascara. It washes off with ease. I also love that you can hear a slight click when it is closed. I have tried many because I thought it was closed.

I absolutely loved this mascara. Not waterproof but it never leaves me with raccoon eyes after crying or even being rubbed. No fall out either! It‚Äôs just like any mascara but this for some reason makes my eyes look awake and lovely! It definitely has a curling effect too!!

The mascara performs beautifully. The only downside is when you apply the fallout is bad. No matter how easy I apply I still have mascara bits falling all over my face.,fallout.. but great length and volume.,8 Jan 2022,Apessie84,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
I wanted to love it but it was not smooth sailing to apply the mascara. It left little chunks at the end of my lashes. My lashes were not lifted like I expected. The brush is not as it appears online. The only reason I will continue to use it is because it makes my lashes dark how I like them. I will stick to Milk mascara.,Disappointed tbh,7 Jan 2022,KennyLynn,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"I saw how highly rated this was and that reviews consistently praised it for not flaking/smudging so I had to try it. For reference my last two mascaras were Better Than Sex and Bobbi Brown's Smokey Eye. Both transfered A LOT, Better Than Sex's was worse between the two. I have very oily skin and a flatter face so it's super difficult to find a mascara that doesn't end up smudging after an hour or so. I need both length and thickness, but a lot of mascaras don't deliver on thickness and my last two were amazing for it with moderate lengthening (which is fine for me I don't want a falsie look with mascara). This one does beautifully with lengthening and pretty well with thickening, although I do wish it did just a tad more thickening. As for smudging/flaking, it's freaking amazing! I've worn it for hours, even took a nap in it and if it does smudge/flake it's barely at all. I'm willing to sacrifice a little thickness for this level of staying power.",Barely smudges/flakes at all,7 Jan 2022,xxcapricious,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I had high hopes because the wand is a cross between hourglass and oval (the ones that compliment my lashes and eye shape the most) but all it did was make my lashes spidery while also clumping every other lash together.

"***This is my personal experience with this product.***

I have oily skin and my face sweats throughout the day as I work. This mascara will spread around my eyes giving me the raccoon eyes.

I always use better than sex and it‚Äôs usually the best mascara on the market but this one I wash shocked to find volumized my lashes like crazy And it costs less. As soon as I‚Äôm done with my current bottle of better than sex I‚Äôm buying this one. I tried it twice already at the store and it stayed on for so many hours and gave me so much length.

Y‚Äôall this is the BEST mascara I have ever tried. No other mascara has kept my lashes up and disappeared off my lashes which was a problem I had with every mascara I‚Äôve used. High end and drugstore. I was a bit skeptical because it honestly looked ordinary to me but nope this is my forever mascara. It holds up all day!!

This is my every day mascara, as I‚Äôd like something more dramatic for fun, colorful, glam looks. I didn‚Äôt experience any flaking with this mascara and it sat comfortably on my eyes. No irritation at all! The brush is kind of thick, so it‚Äôs a bit hard to get into the inner corners.

"So for the most part I LOVE this mascara - the brush is awesome, lashes get well coated and the look it provides is awesome.
I had no complaints and was raving about it to one of my friends, and then I had to back track.
I live in California, where, let‚Äôs face it, the temp barely drops below 70. So out wearing with or without a mask is no issue and you‚Äôre walking around with nothing to complain about.
Add in any type of moisture (in my case, wearing a mask in a cold climate where my breath was escaping from the top the mask and creating moisture on my eyelashes) and you‚Äôre asking for major issues. I have never had a mascara that clumps off like this did - I had to run in to the nearest bathroom and wash all of it off as it looked horrendous.

It has a bigger wand so it's not great for the lower lashes unless I use a lash guard. It builds up really nicely, and I generally have an issue with mascaras transferring to my brow bone this is the only one besides Thrive that doesn't do that.

I love the formula of this mascara. I always have issues with flaking and smudging under my eyes and I've found that this mascara does this less than others (but not completely smudge proof). The reason that I didn't give this a full 5 stars is the brush. The applicator brush gives me clumpy lashes which I then have to brush through with a clean mascara brush.

I would consider myself an extreme mascara snob. I purchase mascaras like they are going out of style. However I can say that this has easily taken first place after what seems like years of trial and error. I‚Äôm not usually a huge fan of the big clunky brush because I feel like I can‚Äôt get in the small parts of the eye. However something about this brush and the formula just really works. It does not clump and I put three heavy coats on my top lashes. I can also get two good coats on my bottom lashes without it looking ridiculous or smudging.

"I really wanted to love this mascara but after weeks of use, it just isn‚Äôt for me. I found a couple things that I really disliked about this mascara, some of these could be reasons why you would like this mascara though:
- Difficult to remove with my makeup remover. I wear a full face of makeup everyday so I like to remove it using a makeup removing oil, and this mascara does not come off with my makeup oil. I have to really rub my lashes and it makes my lashes fall out which doesn‚Äôt happen with other mascaras. However, I found it comes off easily with just water! Which is probably great for those who just wear mascara, but makes it difficult for me because I still need to use my makeup remover and if I apply my makeup removing oil on top of wet skin, it doesn‚Äôt remove my makeup properly. So if you just wear mascara you‚Äôll find this super easy to remove!

- Difficult to apply. I find this is quite a liquid-y mascara, which makes it messy to apply. I often get it all over my eyelids and under my eyes when applying it and once it‚Äôs on, it‚Äôs difficult to remove. This is nice for those who are looking for a mascara that won‚Äôt flake off - it really doesn‚Äôt flake, it‚Äôs so difficult for me to flake off any excess that gets on my eyelids. Gotta have a steady hand for this mascara!

- lastly, and a more personal reason, I simply just don‚Äôt like how it looked on me. I prefer a volumizing mascara that will fan my lashes out, but it just lengthened my lashes and kept them in their original place. I really wanted to love it because I‚Äôve loved every other rare beauty product I‚Äôve tried but it just wasn‚Äôt for me. Doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be for you though! My coworker had this mascara on and it looked GORGEOUS on her, I thought she had extensions on! If the reasons I listed above are things that might make you like a mascara, then give this a try. If you‚Äôre like me though, you might not like it.","not for me, maybe for you!",14 Oct 2021,Dena015,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I found that this mascara is ‚Äúthickening.‚Äù it tends to stick lashes together and clumps at the ends. it dries quick so repeatedly stroking the wand is best in my opinion. it‚Äôs not the most curling in my opinion although it does add volume. i can‚Äôt say much for length as my eyelashes are quite long naturally. i‚Äôd rather use liner to make my lashes appear thicker than a ‚Äúthickening‚Äù mascara. if you like the rounded lash look the wand is great because there‚Äôs more product at the middle since that area is smaller.,fine but i wouldn‚Äôt repurchase,12 Oct 2021,liaayoun,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I have short straight asian eyelashes, so finding a good mascara is unfortunately a tedious task for me. I used to have Benefit mascaras. I needed one that lifts and curls, and even though not waterproof, I needed a non-smudging long-wear. My Benefit ones tended to flake a lot. And were harder to take off at the end of the day. This one never flakes, doesn‚Äôt smudge even under water, but is way easier to take off. I use the Fenty Skin cleanser. My eyelashes look like velvet, it‚Äôs so beautiful. I also compared my usual Benefit on one eye and this Rare Beauty on the other eye, the same day, and hands down, Selena thought of everything. I would recommend even to asian lashes.

"Decided to try it based on so much hype on social media. The packaging is lovely and it gives some good length and decent volume. Unfortunately (and not surprisingly), it didn't work for my sparse, straight lashes. I typically use a lash curler and this mascara just brings the curl down instantly. I also tried it as a layering mascara, using it as a second coat after another mascara that holds my curl. The result was not impressive either since it doesn't seem to build on top of a different mascara well. I can see that it'd work well for you if you have better, maybe naturally full and curled lashes. For me personally this doesn't deliver any desirable results. I ended up returning it but would still recommend giving this a try if you've been curious about it. Two other new mascaras (from ILIA and Patrick Ta) that were released around the same time seem to work for me a lot better as a layering mascara, giving significant volume.",Doesn't hold my curl but gives some natural volume,11 Oct 2021,sphinxlikebecca,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I put on at least 2 coats the full lash and then extra on the sections right above my pupil. Big fan of this mascara and so much better than I expected!!

"I was so excited to get this mascara because i struggle a lot with finding a favorite one. I loved the way it made my lashes darker and look longer, but‚Äî it made them lose their curl (I have straight lashes) so I had to curl them again and at the end, it doesn‚Äôt have the same desirable effect. I wanted to return it but I‚Äôm doing my best to find a trick and make it work because all the rare beauty brand means so much to me (even if this is the first product I‚Äôve purchased from them).",not what I‚Äôve expected but I‚Äôm gonna make it work,7 Oct 2021,ameIie,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"I really wanted to love this mascara because I love everything from Rare Beauty, but this mascara was not for me. I was comparing it to Maybelline Sky High mascara and my L‚Äôoreal Lash Paradise mascara, and kept going back to these. Rare Beauty mascara kept getting on my eyelids, and transferred onto my lower lash line by the end of the day. Really unfortunate, but it does a great job volumizing my lashes!",,7 Oct 2021,alexacamarena,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
This mascara is Amazing. I fell in love at the first try. Super lightweight and gives my lashes a nice lift as well as volume. I like that I can use this mascara and not have the urge to put on fake lashes. It‚Äôs amazing.,Love it,7 Oct 2021,niaalferez,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I absolutely love everything rare beauty but unfortunately I am not a fan of their mascara. I have long lashes and typically look for a mascara that will add some thickness to my length. All this did for me was give more length and stuck my lashes together. This mascara gives little to no volume and does not help separate your lashes. The mascara did not look clumpy but I looked like I had only 10 lashes since this mascara stuck my lashes together and provided no separation. When I used this, I had to use the L‚ÄôOr√©al Lash Paradise to add volume to my lashes. I still think drug store mascaras do a better job and better price.

"BEST mascara ever tried. I tried lots os mascaras and always ending up wearing tubing mascaras because i have not yet find a mascara that doesn‚Äôt smudge. However, tubing mascaras never give the best volume in my opinion. But this is DIFFERENT. I saw Kathleenlight mentioned it in her favorite video and I immediately go to sephora and purchased it. Best decision ever made. Give a good length and volume effect, no smudging at all-even when I did not set my under eyes. Overall so so goodddd.",,5 Oct 2021,kshynn,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"Rare Beauty gifted me the Perfect Strokes Universal Volumizing Mascara for all lash types to lengthen, curl and volumize lashes. I found that the full brush coated my eyelashes evenly and made them look fuller. It didn‚Äôt clump and was easy to build up volume. I noticed a good amount of volume with just one coat. The applicator wand is a bit larger and shorter than what I‚Äôm used to. I find the packaging aesthetically pleasing. For some reason every time I open the tube, I open it upside down. The mascara didn‚Äôt smudge or run and lasted all day. It was easy to remove at the end of the day.",Perfect Strokes,5 Oct 2021,sheighlo,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"I‚Äôm a big fan of every single product this brand has put out but I‚Äôm going to be honest and say I was hesitant about this mascara. This is not the kind of brush I like for my lashes (prefer rubber) and rarely have I ever found anything advertised to be true.  My gosh‚Ä¶ once I used this mascara I promise I was so surprised by this formula. My biggest take away was that this did not clump at all, it lifted my lashes and most importantly it did not flake into my eyes after wearing it all day.. and maybe accidentally sleeping in it too. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it but I love this and after 10 years of using the Lanc√¥me primer & my Mac mascara duo I have completely replaced my go to pair with this mascara.. I‚Äôm still shocked but genuinely so happy. Big fan of this mascara, brand and it formulas.

I love the soft pink packaging, and the brush is good for separating and curling the lashes. It lasted all day without flaking or clumping and didn‚Äôt migrate to my under eye area. It‚Äôs a fairly small tube but I like that because I find mascara dries out too fast. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the brush side being longer than the product side which resulted in my always opening it backward. Ha!",Really nice mascara!,19 Sep 2021,Bellavt,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"Does this brand never disappoint? NEVER. I was so excited to try out this mascara because I am always looking for something that is natural but brings me length. This mascara does just that and more. I am definitely going to be implementing this in my fall makeup routine.

"It's fine..pretty black, first coat goes light and as you build up, it clumps up a bit. It's nothing revolutionary. It performs like almost every other similar priced mascara on the market. One thing I noticed was the terrible bleeding with the slightest bit of water /tears. I got a black eye instantly. That never happens with my hourglass caution or lancome hynose drama

If you have a favorite, just stick to that. It's not really needed.",it's just ok!,19 Sep 2021,Addie68,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"Gifted by Rare Beauty. This is a very natural looking mascara. One thing I really like about it is that it doesn‚Äôt clump and applies evenly. I like the fluffy brush. Some things I dislike are that it didn‚Äôt give me much volume, only length. I do have naturally dark, long lashes but look for something that can make them appear thicker.",Length but no volume,18 Sep 2021,emsunu,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"This is a really nice mascara. The mascara  comes in a minimal, pretty pink tube that contains a deep black formula. The first ingredient is castor oil so the mascara feels like it‚Äôs gliding in a little think but it doesn‚Äôt clump and can be easily brushed out. It gives a nice thickening effect but not a ton of volume. However it makes lashes nice and long, so long that they look pushed up into a curl effect. Here I‚Äôm wearing two coats without curling them and I feel it looks great. It doesn‚Äôt smudge or flake and the castor oil keeps the lashes from getting dried out during the day. It‚Äôs a great daily mascara so if you‚Äôre on the fence I recommend purchasing a tube for yourself.",Rare Beauty Mascara,18 Sep 2021,hollyberry1221,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"This products was gifted to me by Rare Beauty, however it did not influence my opinion in any way.
This mascara kicked out my other favorite mascaras in one go. I don‚Äôt know what is in this formula, but it does not flake or budge, however it‚Äôs not that easy to apply because the brush is so big for my eyes, but that‚Äôs not a problem because the result I get is one of the best.",,18 Sep 2021,Iracherkinskaya,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
The wand on this really lengthens and curls my lashes like no other! My lashes usually stick straight out and this lifts and keeps them curled so good.

i have been using  new Universal Volumizing mascara From Rare Beauty and it really provides Volume.  I have very tiny lashes with zero volume. I applied a few coats on top and bottom lashes and you can really see the difference. I like the wand because with every stroke I can see more volume & some length. I used all day and didn't experience no raccoon eyes. I will definitely add this to my makeup routine.,Great Volume mascara,18 Sep 2021,Violetstorm78,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"Very happy with this purchase. I had just tried the Tarte Big Ego mascara and fell in love with what it did to my lashes, except for the racoon eyes it would leave me with after just a few hours. I bought this on a whim hoping to get something similar but with no running and DANG this mascara gets me 97% of the way there with NO flaking or fallout. Overall, the best mascara I‚Äôve ever used. Formula is nice, not too dry but also not too wet.",,18 Sep 2021,Smiley94,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"This is such a great new mascara! Here‚Äôs why: it gives your lashes a thick enough coat with only one go thru without leaving you with spider lashes. It stays put, and doesn‚Äôt flake or rub off under the eyes. It also washes off very easily with a little cleansing balm. And lastly I‚Äôd just like to mention the price point, which is definitely more realistic than what other brands are pricing their mascaras at.",,17 Sep 2021,beautyqueen1210,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

I have naturally pretty long eyelashes so I mostly look for volume in my mascaras. This mascara gives me lots of length but not enough volume. It has big and fluffy wand but because the applicator is so big I have to be very careful not to get the mascara on my eyelids or under my eyes. The formula is very wet which makes it very easy to get the lashes stuck together. Also because of the wetness it‚Äôs hard to do more than one coat without clumping all the lashes together. It also flaked on me.  So overall unfortunately I‚Äôm not a fan. I can definitely find better and cheaper drugstore option.

It definitely helped to add more volume to my lashes without looking too clumpy! Gifted by Rare Beauty.,So much volume!,15 Sep 2021,MahimaPandoria,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
"I love this mascara! The formula isn‚Äôt super wet, which is perfect for me because I prefer my mascaras to be a little more on the dry side. It makes it easier to work with and the product tends to layer better when I go in for the second coat. I still use a lash primer with this, as I do with any mascara, but this was better than I thought it was going to be! (Gifted by Rare Beauty)",,15 Sep 2021,Sofinaa,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I like it. I don‚Äôt know if I would say it‚Äôs particularly volumizing, but it does make my lashes long and wispy.  I would also prefer if the wand handle were a little longer, but that just may be me. Overall it‚Äôs good, not great.",,15 Sep 2021,pennypens,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

The formula is a bit on the drier side. It applies somewhat clump free. I didn‚Äôt notice any noticeable volumizing nor lengthening effects. My biggest gripe is that it is NOT smudge proof. There are many drugstore mascaras that are better and cheaper.,Nothing special,15 Sep 2021,Booppp,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
Was excited to try this mascara because it was gifted to me by rare beauty. I really like the wand of this mascara! I really hope so too late then and volumize. The formula works well for the bigger wand but it is pretty stubborn to take off. Took me several swipes and tugging it unclump,It‚Äôs average,15 Sep 2021,HanaRoxanne,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes
I‚Äôm really not a fan. It‚Äôs not volumizing enough for me. I even used two coats. I will say it is lengthening though. Another dislike is that it leaves my lashes crunchy. I received a mini to test gifted by Rare Beauty. That was a terrible way to test out this mascara. The component was so bulky that it makes application hard to do.,Not a fan,15 Sep 2021,Midbeauty,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"Gifted by Rare Beauty: I was really excited about this bc it specifically calls out stick straight eyelashes. I‚Äôve struggled w my stick straight lashes my whole life. I can only dream of what it must be like to have curled lashes naturally! 

I applied two coats. The second coat definitely provided more lift to my lashes but it still wasn‚Äôt the same as using an eyelash curler. Mostly the outer corners curled up but overall, kind of impressive bc no mascara ever curls my lashes but disappointing that it wasn‚Äôt a more dramatic lift. I have thick, long, stick straight lashes so sadly they might be too long and heavy for it to work properly.",Still need an eyelash curler,14 Sep 2021,dianaericaa,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"Rare beauty gifted me @rarebeauty 
I naturally have eyelashes that go straight down. There is absolutely no curl to them whatsoever (the complete opposite actually) and I feel like eyelash curlers have also been culprit to my lash loss. This mascara is exactly what I was looking for. I have lost a lot of volume in my lashes over the years because I was using really intense mascaras that would not come off without having to scrub hard and lose a lot of hair in the process. This mascara stays on ALL day and as you can see, makes a huge difference in how full my lashes look. It removes easily with makeup wipes and does not flake throughout the day. I will say, it begins to flake after about an 11 hour wear and thats when I remove it.",Love this mascara,13 Sep 2021,Arvika,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

This one does a great job at separating the lashes and adding a good amount of volume. You also don‚Äôt need a ton of coats for a full lash effect. One or two give a nice coated, black lash.

I‚Äôm a fan of rare beauty products and was very impressed with this mascara. I have short lashes that point downward so I normally go for mascaras with thin brushes and a waterproof formula.

This mascara is pretty good and does a great job at lengthening my lashes but isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúvolumizing‚Äù don‚Äôt get me wrong, my lashes look so long and beautiful after applying but doesn‚Äôt make them look fuller. I do appreciate that I never saw any clumping and it also doesn‚Äôt make my lashes feel hard and dry as some other mascaras do.  The wand is nice, and makes it easy to separate your lashes.

"This mascara really surprised me! It lifts, separates, and gives you lots of manageable volume. I like that you can still layer coats to get more volume for dramatic looks, but can be more subdued with just one layer. The mascara wand is not too big and I can use it on my bottom lashes as well. It doesn‚Äôt flake or smudge, and I can get 12+ hours of wear. It‚Äôs not waterproof though, so won‚Äôt withstand tears. It comes off fairly easily with a balm cleanser or a foaming cleanser. I like the packaging, it feels luxe and beautiful in the hands. Overall, a really nice mascara from Rare Beauty.

"complimentary from Rare Beauty

 it doesn't smudge much. It's also easy to remove. It appears to add length, as well, to the eyelashes, but I'm not a good judge on that, as my lashes are already long. My problem is volume.
I have pretty fine lashes so I like to scrape off most of the mascara and apply it with the short bristles with very little product on the wand. Then I can go back in and apply more coats to add volume, that way I don't get like 5 clumped-up mega lashes. I LOVE that this stuff washes off in the shower. I just take a little soap and gently rub my lashes a little and it comes off. I used some makeup remover on a cotton pad after I showered to see if there was mascara still on my lashes but there wasn't, it really does wash off. I don't get how it can stay on so well without smudging and flaking but not be waterproof and wash off with soap and water.",great,9 Sep 2021,HildaYu,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

If the formula is too wet, I‚Äôll have a clumpy nightmare. I also wear contacts so the formula can‚Äôt be too dry that it flakes off. As far as the formula goes, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty Goldilocks.

"I received this product complimentary from RARE Beauty. While I normally do not use water resistant mascaras, this held up decently well!

"I‚Äôve loved the few products I‚Äôve been able to try from Rare Beauty so far. This is one that I was gifted by Rare Beauty.  I combine it with another mascara to have held and keep the curl. I especially love the waterproof factor in this because the mascara I use with this is not waterproof and has smudges. So it layers and separates beautifully and almost becomes like a finisher or ‚Äúsetting spray‚Äù for my lashes. Definitely on the lower end of mascara prices, so I would suggest giving it a try! Mascara‚Äîlike foundations are mostly subjective IMO. Hopefully, this works for you as well!",,8 Sep 2021,brittuhneeanne,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I've been a dedicated drugstore mascara wearer for over 10 years now. I've always found that most ""higher end"" mascaras don't deliver better results for the price so it didn't feel necessary to dish out extra money. Well...consider my head turned with this mascara. I usually don't have high expectations for mascaras because many perform the same on me -- I have naturally long eyelashes that hold a curl pretty well so most mascaras work for me. This one definitely didn't disappoint in the lengthening department for me and it made my blonde lashes very, very noticeable in the best way possible. I put on two layers of this mascara and couldn't even feel it. I even layered it with another mascara to see how they paired together and still absolutely weightless. It also didn't smudge AT ALL, not even on my bottom lashes. I'm very imrpessed by this mascara and will likely be repurchasing when I run out because my lashes have never felt better. I'd say the only con is that the wand is pretty thick so you have to be a little careful when applying it. Other than that, no complaints here!",,8 Sep 2021,francescapg,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

"I received this mascara today and immediately tried it. I have to say that I‚Äôm very impressed upon initial application.  This mascara actually curled my lashes!  I never use a lash curler as I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll pull out my lashes, so they rarely ever have a curl, but this mascara totally did it. It definitely lengthened and there was a bit of volumizing but I saw the curling and lengthening effects the most. I use Babe Lash to grow my lashes so they are already pretty long but this definitely emphasized the length. It‚Äôs definitely not a natural looking mascara (but it doesn‚Äôt clump or look spidery) so I‚Äôll use something else when I‚Äôm going for a no makeup makeup look, but that‚Äôs not the point of this mascara anyway.

"I really loved this mascara! I was honestly surprised with how good & LONG my lashes looked after using this product since my lashes are very short and usually have a hard time finding a mascara that works well for them. 

It gave my lashes really great individual length & thickness without being clumpy at all. I like that the applicator brush is not too big because it allows you to easily get the corners of your eyes without any smudging or messiness.

Rarebeautygiftedme their perfect strokes universal volumizing mascara. I couldn‚Äôt wait and tried it immediately! I have long lashes but they tend to fall straight instead of being curled. The wand has tightly packed bristles that coat each lash appropriately and help them lift and curl upwards. I like that it doesn‚Äôt come out with too much of product (at times mascaras make lashes clumpy with too much product). This doesn‚Äôt do that at all.

"My lashes are long & straight that they point down. I thought this might be that one mascara that I could wear that wasn‚Äôt waterproof but I was wrong. I normally curl my lashes to the point that they touch my eyebrows and then use mascara, and I did that with this mascara and even then I saw them starting to fall & lose the curl. It did hold up a bit but not to my liking and i had to re-curl my lashes just so they would stay up. So if you have my lash type be aware that it might not hold the curl as well as a regular waterproof mascara would. Left eye is my everyday waterproof mascara and the right eye is the rare beauty mascara. Love the formula, just didn‚Äôt work the best for me",Straight Lashed Girls Beware,5 Sep 2021,Esm3ralda,RareBeauty,Mascara,Yes

It lifts, lengthens my lashes,no clumpyness what‚Äôs so ever and so many people thought I was actually wearing false lashes so that I was loving because when I told them they were my own lashes they were so surprised and told them they needed the mascara because from the results of my lashes it was sold.
